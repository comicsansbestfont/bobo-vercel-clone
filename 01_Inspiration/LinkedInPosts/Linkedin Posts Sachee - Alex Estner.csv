Here’s what they do — and what you should do instead 👇 ❌ Run multiple motions (PLG + SLG) ✅ Pick one motion & nail it before layering others --> Large companies can afford to run Product-Led and Sales-Led motions simultaneously because they have resources and mature data to support both - you don't. ❌ Serve multiple ICPs ✅ Focus on one ideal ICP --> big SaaS can target different customer segments without losing focus or efficiency - you can't. ❌ Cover multiple use cases ✅ Solve one painful problem --> covering multiple use cases dilutes your focus, spreads your product and messaging too thin, and makes it very hard to achieve product–market fit fast. Each use case usually means a different pain point, buying trigger, and sales motion. ❌ Active on every channel ✅ Master 1–2 channels --> Concentrate efforts on the one or two channels that deliver consistent results before expanding. ❌ Complex pricing (feature gating, multiple value metrics) ✅ Keep it simple (one value metric, no feature gating if possible) --> You don’t have enough customer data or usage patterns to design smart feature gating or multi-metric pricing. Complex models only create friction in buying and learning. Your goal isn’t to optimize margins, it’s to validate willingness to pay and shorten the sales cycle. Treat pricing as an iterative feedback loop ❌ Heavy demand gen ✅ Focus on demand capture --> Instead of creating new demand, capture existing intent where your ideal customers are already looking ❌ Lot of TOFU content ✅ Focus on high intent BOFU content --> BOFU content (case studies, comparison pages, Best of listicles) speaks directly to prospects who already feel the pain and are ready to buy. Your priority is capturing existing demand, not educating the entire market. ❌ Specialized GTM teams ✅ Founder-Led Sales --> One founder must lead sales to learn customer pain, refine ICP & messaging, and prove repeatability. ❌ Big brand plays (Events, Creative Campaigns, PR...) ✅ Focus on social proof (case studies) and founder brand --> Leverage testimonials and the founder’s credibility to build trust. 👉 What else?",19h,53,16,2,Yes,image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQHkzDoYhhBLig/feedshare-shrink_800/B4EZokkwWMHgAg-/0/1761550209530?e=1762992000&v=beta&t=k3_sw_cEro5MQYd0y4g5T-UIU-DRx6J1XRqT82a8ZiQ

Douwe Wester 🟢 👉 calls this The GTM OS → the one-page operating system founders can use to align strategy, marketing, sales, and CS. Most teams try to fix GTM by adding more activity: → More outbound → More content → More CSMs But without a system, all of it runs in different directions. Here's how The GTM OS works: Start at the top: ↳ Look at your top 20% customers ↳ Run win/loss, SPICED, pipeline data ↳ Analyze market shifts and competitor plays Then build your profile: ↳ What does your real ICP look like? ↳ What’s their journey? ↳ Who are you actually winning with? Now clarify your value: ↳ What are you really selling? ↳ How does your pricing support that? ↳ Can your team say it the same way? Only then do we activate the tactics: ↳ Marketing that speaks to the real buyer ↳ Sales that qualifies, not guesses ↳ CS that drives success, not churn prevention When it’s all on one page, the chaos disappears.

I expect 3 things becoming key for early-stage founders to stand out: 1) starting with a highly specialized usecase/workflow 2) GTM execution is key (otherwise no one will use your product) 3) Brand and trust become key --> I try this product as I like the brand, trust the founder... But especially with AI products, pricing is relevant. Because the cost side can become very expensive. And people are mostly unaware of what the product is capable. So they are more sceptical. This is why we also see a shift towards 'outcome' pricing. Maybe in the feature even ROI-based?

Help your visitors understand how much it is going to cost them. Your job is to find the best way to communicate this information to them. Here are the 6 main elements of a good pricing menu - 1️⃣ Pricing Modality → How you charge. Options include - Flat Fees (e.g. 50€/month), - Licenses (e.g. 50€/month/user), - Usage-Based (e.g. 0,1€ per contact), - Credits (e.g. 100€ for 1000 credits), or a combination. 2️⃣ Pricing Metrics (aka. value metric) → The unit(s) you charge for (e.g., Users, GPUs, APIs, etc). 3️⃣ Value Ladder (aka. feature gating) → How value scales (e.g., collaboration, automation, governance, etc). Usually, there’s a feature “theme” that scales the value of a product. 4️⃣ Packaging → How you organize your modality, metrics, and features into bundles, usually as discrete tiers. 💡Though some companies don’t do this, and go with ‘pay as you go’ or à la carte packaging. 5️⃣ Price → How much each option costs, and the billing period. 6️⃣ Call to Action → What visitors should do next. Usually, either get started, free trial, request a demo, or contact sales. These concepts might sound way more complicated than they actually are. But remember, you want to make the pricing menu such that it helps a visitor quickly understand how your pricing strategy works. ------ Btw, Rob Litterst and I have come up with the Ultimate Guide to SaaS Pricing Page.

In reality, it is a stall-out. Durable teams make the hard choice: one ICP, one motion, one playbook. That does not mean you ignore optionality forever. It means you prove one motion works end to end before adding the next. Think of it like this, Your (single) ICP today brings you to your next milestone.

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7384113599549702144/,"Last week, I discussed a new sales compensation plan with a SaaS founder. The team is 3 AEs. Currently, there is no formal quota system in place. I took some notes to prepare for the session 👇 A good compensation plans start with 3 things: 1) On target earnings (OTE) - e.g. 150k€ per year 2) A split of base salary vs. variable bonus - e.g. 60/40 3) Quota to OTE ratio - e.g. a 4x So let's make this practical. You want your AE to earn 150k on target. With a 60/40 split and a 4x ratio, you will end up with: 90k€ base salary 60k€ bonus 4x 150k€ = 600k€ Quota Your AE needs to close 600k€ in revenue for a 100% quota attainment. With a 20k€ ACV, this means roughly 30 won deals per year. To make the model fair and attractive, I would recommend: --> Quarterly Quota (e.g. 150k€ per quarter) --> with quarterly payouts --> lower threshold (e.g. 30% or less, 0% commission) --> Uncapped (meaning if they close more, there is no maximum) --> Accelerator to incentivize overperformance (e.g. 15% instead of 10%) Don't forget to acknowledge the ramp-up phase of new hires. A practical tip: Give them between 50-100% of quota attainment during onboarding. Curious, what do you see in the market right now?

ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) Know your perfect customers, the ones who really benefit from your product. You can't sell to everyone. 2. Positioning Know your category and why your product stands out in that category. 3. Messaging Turn your positioning into customer-facing words that actually resonate. This becomes the foundation for all your sales & marketing. 4. GTM Channels The bridge between messaging and your ICP. Pick 1-2 channels. Master them before adding more. 5. Pricing What is the right value metric for your product? Keep it iterative. Perfect pricing comes later. 6. Sales Motion How you serve clients: Product-led vs. Sales-led vs. hybrid. Choose one dominant motion early. Don't do both in parallel. 7. Buyer Journey Map how prospects move from awareness to customer onboarding. Each stage needs intentional design.

And adding 'ai-powered' to your messaging doesn't replace the hard positioning work you need to do. Explain in easy words: --> what your product does --> for who it's most valuable --> What benefits they have from using it 2. Go from 0 to scalable Don't try to go from nothing to finding the 'scalable' growth channels. Why not start to go from 0 to 1 client. Then from 1 to 10 Then from 10 to 100. Still the most effective ways are 'hard work' here. I mean: - ask your network for intros - reach out manually to high fit ICPs - write hand-written high value content - do high quality BOFU content - Ask for referrals from your first customers You get the point. 3. Adding a lot of features Because shipping new features get easier, founders tend to build a lot. I believe it's still best to do 1 usecase very good. Focus on this one usecase. Only build the best 'features' for this 1 usecase. Don't dilute to early. Even if you can 'easily' build all of this. Because market 'all these features' is hard.

There are 2 parts to it: 1️⃣ Keep building your own network -> Every conversation, every event, every post is a potential touchpoint. -> If you invest consistently, your network compounds — and you can sell through it forever. 2️⃣ Leverage your team's network -> When you hire, you don’t just get skills. You also get access to the relationships they’ve built over years. -> That’s another network multiplier. So yes, “network sales” is repeatable. So let's talk numbers. Imagine you talk to 5 people every week. And you build the muscle to ask them for referrals / warm intros. To people that fit your ICP. And 20% do this. Introduce you to 2 people.

You need to: -> Find your ICP -> Validate messaging that converts -> Find channels that work -> Build your GTM Foundation A GTM engineer excels at optimizing funnels, automating sequences, and scaling what already works.

Trying to sell to everyone who'll pay is the slowest path to 1€M, or at least the slowest to 10€M ARR. Why? Each customer segment you serve requires its own GTM Foundations.

Instead, use AI as an enabler like this ✅ You create the ICP doc (from real customer conversations) ✅ You build the messaging framework (from market research) ✅ You define the positioning (from competitive analysis) THEN you feed all that context to AI for execution. When you're 0-1, you don't need to scale; you need to learn. A lot. You need to understand your ICP → Why do they actually buy → What are their pain points → What objections keep coming up → How is your market moving Do the learning first. Build the frameworks.

Ask them, ""who else do you think can benefit from this?"" - Turn customer success into a revenue driver through expansion and referrals 🚨It's not going to be an easy, repeatable process, But you need to put in the reps in the beginning.

It does one or two jobs well. And that’s exactly how it should be. But as your product grows, so do its capabilities. It starts to solve more problems and cover more use cases. That’s when your homepage alone is not enough anymore, and it makes sense to introduce product pages. Your homepage is ❌ NOT a detailed page about how your product works. ❌ It’s NOT a page purely on 1 specific use case or 1 specific feature. Instead, ✅ That’s the job of product pages. You usually find these pages sitting in the nav bar under ‘product’ or ‘solutions’. Usually, you see 3 different types of pages that contain more detailed product information. 1️⃣ Feature pages 2️⃣ Use-case pages 3️⃣ Persona/Teams, Company type / Industry pages Each of these pages has a slightly different focus. ✅ Feature pages and Use-case pages focus on ‘how it works’. ✅ Persona/Teams, company type, and industry pages focus on ‘Who it’s for and how this type of audience benefits from using the product’. Go check out the feature pages of companies like Livestorm , Clay , Loom , who do this very extensively. Building those product pages comes with a few benefits: 1️⃣ Homepage visitors find information that matches their specific needs quickly 2️⃣ Sales and support teams share more information about a specific feature in a snackable format 3️⃣ Search engines and LLMs understand the core capabilities of your product and recommend your tool in their answers. 👇 Let us know your best product pages in the comments.",2mo,30,12,3,Yes,image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQENUlKPAzh2Pg/feedshare-shrink_800/B4EZjLUgpCHoAg-/0/1755757812189?e=1762992000&v=beta&t=Zi3E9JN9fY_rGTP99Ry8auUOJ2Xc6Q6L95-IUdtTbcE

If your words don’t mark all 3, replace them with a better alternative. 3️⃣ “How short should this be?” test → You want your message to only include as many words as you need to be understood. Prefer a clear message over a vague message (even if it means more words). 4️⃣ ""General or specific messaging” test → The right ‘altitude’ depends on the stage of awareness of your customers. - Do they already have a solution like yours? - Or never considered something like this? Generally speaking: ✅ The less they are aware, the wider and more generic your messaging should be. ✅ The more they already know, the deeper and more specific your messaging needs to be. 5️⃣ “Is this even credible?” test → Spot words that sound overpromising, or unrealistic. We all know them: “Transform”, “revolutionize” “success guarantee”...) 6️⃣ “Can you spot ICP and product category/use case in your homepage hero section?” test → If you read the hero section of your website, do you mention specifically ‘who this is for? (aka. your ICP)” and “what is it? (aka. product category or use case). 7️⃣ “Does this survive the elevator” test → Imagine you have 20 seconds to explain what your product does to a distracted stranger.

As a founder, you should ALWAYS have a pulse on your numbers, regardless of meetings or crisis. Here's what I recommend you do 1️⃣ Creat a spreadsheet that helps you track KPIs on a weekly and monthly basis. 2️⃣ Every week, spend 5 minutes to - Go to your Hubspot (or your go to CRM) - Check your reports - Copy paste the numbers to the spreadsheet. As simple as that. But as an early stage founder, it's the best way to get thinking about numbers and metrics. When you actually extract MQLs, SQLs, active pipeline, ACVs, etc., from dashboards and update them in a spreadsheet, you ✅ Better understand your growth ✅ Identify areas of improvement earlier ✅ Constantly track your progress --> It's taking 5 minutes to proactively review your numbers.

Getting your CRM right from the start sets the foundation for predictable revenue later. Whether you're bootstrapped, pre-seed or seed stage, do your CRM foundation work! Your CRM is the backbone of your sales process. Here are the 10 most common CRM mistakes I see across early-stage SaaS teams. ❌ Mistake 1: Using different tools/documents in parallel to CRM ✅ → Your CRM needs to be your single source of truth (in almost real-time) ❌ Mistake 2: No definitions to create & move deals ✅ → Define clear entry and exit criteria. ❌ Mistake 3: Inefficient work with deal stage probabilities ✅ → Set realistic deal stage probabilities. Review 1x/ quarter. ❌ Mistake 4: Insufficient work with lost reasons ✅ → Use Lost reason dropdowns + additional text field ❌ Mistake 5: Treating the CRM like a storage system, not a sales tool ✅ → Log activities, set tasks, use templates, and review reports. A good CRM setup makes your sales more efficient. ❌ Mistake 6: No clear owner for CRM hygiene ✅ → Create a CRM playbook everyone needs to follow. Define a CRM owner. ❌ Mistake 7: Using too many custom fields too early ✅ → Apply a sales methodology. Review monthly for unused/irrelevant fields. ❌ Mistake 8: Using the same pipeline for new business and expansion ✅ → Set up different pipelines for new business & expansion. ❌ Mistake 9: No activity tracking (calls, emails, meetings) ✅ → Log every customer interaction in your CRM ❌ Mistake 10: Not customizing CRM to your sales motion ✅ → Customize pipeline stages, fields, and workflows to reflect your real process.

It requires constant iteration and actively listening to customers at every touchpoint. For context, I recently helped a founder launch a new website. After a few demo calls, we noticed that customers kept asking for this particular capability again and again. Reason? It was TOTALLY missing from our messaging framework and thus from our website messaging. We immediately ended up refining our messaging and our website, but the learning here is that 🔑 Insights from customer touchpoints are crucial for your growth. Especially your discovery, demo calls. They help you fine-tune your messaging and sharpen your positioning. If your product isn't positioned well or you are not able to communicate it with the right messaging, your GTM is going to fail right away.

My 6 GTM takeaways of the evening. 1️⃣ Controversial opinion on the future of cold calls In times of AI SDRs doing cold calls and Apple launching new features to block calls from unknown people. GTM leaders have different opinions on the success of cold calls in the future. Oliver Manojlovic believes cold calls will still be successful in 3 years, while Stefan Bader is a strong believer that this channel will collapse. 2️⃣ Betting on multiple motions Almost all guests had the same opinion. To be successful in the future, you need to run multiple motions at the same time. This depends on the stage of the company. I say if you are below 1€ million ARR, please only run one motion. 3️⃣ AI in GTM I asked Georg Okamoto Hartmut Hahn and Oliver Manojlovic what works and what doesn't. And I expected to hear about crazy Clay automations. But they all agree that especially research and internal processes work great. --> Analyzing call performances to uncover hidden patterns --> Database research (find a customer with X and Y attributes) 4️⃣ Narrative power makes you a better leader Robin Karakash explained that in times of changes, like cultural pivots, new market entries, and rebrandings, the biggest challenge is NOT a bad strategy or execution. But rather the absence of a shared sensemaking narrative. That's the power of a strong narrative. It was a really inspiring event with lots of GTM insights shared. 5️⃣ AI changes the success of GTM channels Melanie Riebel shared how they adapted their channels. From classical SEO to mainly optimizing content for LLMs. And Björn Wisnewski shares his deep diving into his existing customer base to better understand his ICP and shifting more focus to digital channels (more inside sales on top of field sales). 6️⃣ Human-centered channels work Micro events, partnerships, and influencers are channels that work well. The common thread. Humans create trust. Especially in times when Email and LinkedIn inboxes are spammed. Agents doing cold calls and content is AI-written. --- Thanks Julius Göllner and Stefan Bader , and the whole team, for this great event. 👇Do you think cold calls will be successful in 2028?",3mo,34,6,0,Yes,image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQGn4qcjMQcN_w/feedshare-shrink_800/B4EZgdHtF4HIAg-/0/1752835216532?e=1762992000&v=beta&t=6sqdOmzIthRtXvMT4K8wZMn5csS5gavPpAh6oAx9IjE

Is creating your sales deck a super daunting task for you? 🚨Do these two things BEFORE you design your sales deck to save hours of back and forth and money. 1️⃣ Decide the outline -> You need to convey your story through your sales deck. -> Take each slide within a template and write 1-2 sentences about what part of your story you want to cover on that page. -> Focus on perfecting your messaging for that page. 2️⃣ Read it out loud -> Yes, you read that right. -> Read those outlines out loud with your team members/co-founder/friends, anyone. -> This simple step makes sure you have a consistent and compelling story. I recently did this with one of the founders I'm working with, and it was a game-changer. Do these two things before you think of visuals, design or before sending it to your designer.

Getting your GTM strategy right from Day 1. I did a podcast with Joran Hofman recently, where he asked me why it was so important for founders to have GTM strategy right from day one. Here's what I told him, Think of your GTM in two parts 1️⃣ Strategy 2️⃣ Execution Without a strategy, execution won’t work, and the opposite is true as well. Eg - Your ICP, Positioning and Messaging (strategy) are TOO relevant for GTM execution. Without these, you won't know - Who to sell to - Why customers should pick you - How do you communicate with your customers Without the right GTM playbook, you waste your runway chasing wrong-fit customers and/or unscalable channels. During early days, aim to create repeatability in your GTM. Spend time charting your GTM strategy, you'll be much better off managing your runway and executing your GTM. What do you think? The rest of the episode is full of such insights. Check it out if you're a founder in the 0-1 mil ARR stage.

So today, I am sharing my own GTM playbook. 1️⃣ Content -> I have been writing MRR Unlocked 🚀 , my GTM newsletter, bi-weekly for the last 3+ years. -> I have also been posting GTM content daily on LinkedIn My goal of creating content is to - Reach more founders and help them - Build trust - Build relationships with them by providing value upfront It's a long-term game, don't expect immediate results. 2️⃣ Referrals I advise most of my founders to do this, so naturally, I've been doing it too. -> I actively ask the founders I have/am working with for case studies, testimonials, and referrals. 3️⃣ Partnerships -> I have created a network of trusted partners within different niches in GTM. -> These enable cross recommendations and warm intros. -> I have also been experimenting with VC / business angel partnerships and value-based outreach to ICP founders on LinkedIn (will keep you posted on how it goes) Next on my list are: --> Podcast guest speaking --> Newsletter guest posts --> Deepen VC partnerships Building trust and relationships is key to enabling growth. Content has been one of the best levers to build these. P.S.

And I hope I can break this myth today 🚨You don't need the perfect GTM playbook from day 1. Instead, think of it as an iterative process. While 0 to 1 is a big milestone, it comes with not ONE, but THREE different stages 1️⃣ Hustle mode 2️⃣ Focus Mode (pre-PMF) 3️⃣ Expansion Mode (post-PMF) What works for hustle mode, will certainly not work for focus mode and what works for focus mode, will not work for expansion mode. Each of these stages comes with its playbook, strategy, and channels Your growth across these stages is hardly linear. So the best way to approach this is to keep iterating your GTM playbook.

By doing these 3 non-scalable and hard things👇 1️⃣ Leveraging your network - Reach out to your old colleagues, SMEs, advisors, and investors (if any), to get to your first set of early customers. 2️⃣ Spending time on discovery - Talk to as many potential customers as possible (you can do cold outreach here) - Record every call, show them your product, let them use it, and give you feedback. - High chances these will be your early customers 3️⃣ Doubling down on referrals - Once you have early customers, use your conversations and touchpoints with them to ask for referrals. Ask them, ""who else do you think can benefit from this?"" - Turn customer success into a revenue driver through expansion and referrals 🚨It's not going to be an easy, repeatable process, But you need to put in the reps in the beginning.

Some fields you shouldn't miss: -> Self reported attribution -> Lost reason -> ICP / Usecase ->Deal stage probability ->Buying roles --> ICP criteria like tech stack, size, alternative solutions... 2️⃣ GTM Collaterals Here are a few that 99% of founders need - Homepage - Other website pages: Pricing + Book a Demo + How it works (feature / usecase pages) + Resource - Sales Deck - Case Studies - LinkedIn profiles 3️⃣ Forecasting & Planning -> Reverse engineer to break a hard-to-grasp goal into very specific, short-term goals. -> Use these as to-dos to work on within your daily operation. 4️⃣ Internal Operations & Systems Create systems to deal with: - Investor Updates - Founder Syncs (weekly meetings, offsites...) - Goal setting frameworks (e.g. OKRs) - Sales, Marketing, Customer Success Syncs - Product & ‘GTM’ Syncs (Roadmap planing, Customer Feedbacks…) - Competitive Intelligence Hopefully, by now, ✅ You know and understand the GTM foundations well. ✅ You can use them to grow your SaaS.

Today, I will break down SaaS pricing for you. Your pricing is simply a combination of 4 factors 1️⃣ Value Metrics -> Align these with the customer's value of using your product -> These can be per seat / per user / per subscriber, etc. 2️⃣ Packaging & Tiers -> Decide on what (not) to include in tiers. -> Here, you can experiment with feature gating 3️⃣ Payment terms Decide on policies like - Contract duration - Cancellation policy - (Auto) renewals and timelines - Billing policy (monthly / yearly) 4️⃣ Discount policy -> Create a framework of how, when, and why to give discounts -> Always ask for something in return, like referrals, testimonials, etc. You don't need to have your pricing figured out on day 1. Bonus: Do NOT copy the 'perfect' pricing models from Notion, Miro, Asana of the world. Not if you are early-stage ⛔ Pricing for early-stage startups is NOT about optimizing growth. I believe pricing should be good enough to NOT stop you from growing to 1€ million ARR.

It can be Sales-led or Product-led. ✅ Sales-led -> If the CTA on your website/emails says ""Book a demo"" you're probably aiming for a sales-led motion. -> A sales team member is involved in the buying process ✅ Product-led -> If you're pushing for ""Free Trials"", you're aiming for a product-led motion. -> The interaction is directly between your product and the user without any sales involvement.

But, how do you REACH your ICP to convey your messaging? Good news is, you have plenty of options to reach your ICP. They're called GTM channels. There are 21 different channels, to be precise. But, as an early-stage startup, keep in mind that 1️⃣ You can NOT run more than 3 (better 1-2) in parallel 2️⃣ Not all channels are equally relevant for you (depends on your ICP, ACV, own skills) Depending on your stage, some channels are a better fit than others. If you are just starting, use primary channels like - Network & Referrals - Content & SEO - Social Selling (LinkedIn) - Outbound - Social Listening - Google Ads Once you find a primary channel that works, use secondary channels like - Affiliates - LinkedIn Ads - Influencers - Events - PR - Partnerships - Communities It's tempting to use multiple channels at once, to ""speed up"" your growth.

How do you TELL your ICP that you are the best fit for them? How do you communicate your value proposition to them? Messaging bridges this gap and lets you communicate your value to ICP. Your messaging is built on 5 parts ✅ Market ✅ ICP ✅ Competitive alternatives ✅ Product ✅ Value proposition Use it in GTM collaterals like ✅ Homepage ✅ Sales Deck ✅ LinkedIn posts ✅ Case Studies ✅ Sales Demos Take some time to get it right.

If you want: - a detailed guide to execute each of these steps, - my ICP framework then, check out the link in the comments. PS: Don't forget to map your Anti-ICP, who you do NOT want as customers.

You need to convince the stakeholders that your product solves their problem and is the best solution for a very specific use case. Pricing can ✅ be a game stopper, but ❌ not a reason to win deals. What I mean by this is that B2B buyers do not just buy products because they are now cheaper. They buy because they understand the value (or at least are convinced enough to test it out). So value is closing deals. Pricing then can be just a game-stopper. A reason to lose deals. But never a reason to win deals. P.S.

If you're stuck at that stage, don't worry. Here are a few things you can do 👇 (I know this from having helped 20+ founders in their GTM in the last two years) 1️⃣ Do a sales funnel deep dive -> Try to map the part of the funnel that is broken. Is it awareness, conversion, churn? Enough new pipeline? Good Win rate? Healthy churn rate? Fix accordingly. 2️⃣ Find and nail your ICP -> To scale, analyze your early customers to identify your best ICP and go after only them. Don't try to 'scale' in different usecases and different ICPs to early. Less is more. 3️⃣ Create a repeatable sales motion -> Document your sales playbook step by step and note what works. -> Aim to create a standardized process for sales. This will also help when you start building your sales team. 4️⃣ Double down on 1-2 GTM channels -> Instead of trying to be everywhere, identify 1-2 channels that worked for you in the past and double down on those heavily. Make sure you track your sources properly. I'm a big fan of self-reported attribution. 5️⃣ Invest in a referral engine -> This depends on your ACV, but referrals are a great channel to scale during early days. Every customer interaction can be a source for a warm intro/referral. Depends on your sales motion, you have different sources for referrals: - Your sales calls, onboarding calls, support calls. - In-product announcement - Post NPS surveys 6️⃣ Invest in social proof and case studies -> You need to build trust with prospects, that your product can solve their problem. -> Build social proof and case studies from the customers that you already have, and use them to convince new customers.

So today, I've decided to address these for all early-stage founders.👇 1️⃣ ""Will I be really working with you or just a team member of yours?"" - Well, I am the team. I'm not an agency. When you sign up for the advisory, you work 1-on-1 with me through our 6-month sprint. 2️⃣ ""Why 6-months - I rather want to have 2-3 sessions."" - It is almost impossible to see the impact of GTM changes in 2-3 sessions. You need to consistently work on your GTM for months to see a positive impact. - However, I do offer GTM power hour sessions for a few select use-cases. 3️⃣ I want someone who does it for me, not with me This one cracks me up all the time. - As founders, it is YOUR responsibility to be in the trenches and take ownership of your GTM. I am your co-pilot, but you still need to be the one to execute. - If you outsource GTM during the early stage, you'll lose the pulse on your own business. Incase something goes wrong, you won't know what hit you! But of course, once we deep dive into executing different GTM channels, it might be helpful to bring in some experts (e.g. SEO, Paid Ads, Designer...) I've build a network of highly vetted partners. So you as a founder get a warm intro to them and know they will execute well. If you have any more questions regarding my GTM advisory, feel free to DM.

I recently got asked this question and it caught me slightly offguard. Because GTM is not a one day thing. It requires months of focused work to succeed. But here's what I told them anyway 1️⃣ I'd dig into their sales funnel to identify what is not working - Usually, it's either a Top of Funnel awareness problem, or a Middle of Funnel conversion issue. - Whatever it is, I'd fix that first to make sure the pipeline isn't leaky. 2️⃣ I'd review their key GTM assets like website, sales deck and sales call recordings The goal? - To identify if their positioning and messaging is well executed. - Is their Who, What, Why clear? And finally, 3️⃣ I'd analyze their definition of ICP - The idea is to see the ""tightness"" of their ICP, how clear are they in understanding their ICP. - Most founders think they know their ICP, but their pipeline tells a different story. - So I’d compare their ICP definition to their actual pipeline and see if it is aligned. 🚨GTM foundations are all dependent on each other. So, it is essential to have some of these basics in place, else scaling your GTM will be hard. ❌ Honestly, you can’t fix everything in a day. Fixing GTM isn’t a quick job.

Depending on your stage, some channels are a better fit than others.

I always wanted to know: 'How is it working with me? So I asked Andi a few questions - I wanted brutal honesty from him 😀. Let's go. 1️⃣ What helped you surprisingly well that you didn’t expect from me? --> Your radical focus on clarity. No PowerPoint overload, just one question: “What drives revenue and growth within our ICP?” 2️⃣ What’s one trait of mine that’s incredibly effective—but occasionally frustrating? --> You're relentless. That’s incredibly valuable - even if you sometimes just wish you’d let it slide. 3️⃣ When have you felt the most challenged by me? --> When you tore apart our entire sales setup. You cut old habits and sharpened our ICP. That meant letting go of a lot. It was tough, but necessary. Nothing was the same after that. Thankfully. 4️⃣ Have I ever pushed you too far or too fast? What happened? --> Yes. Quite often actually 😂. And I’m glad you did. 5️⃣ What’s something I do that took time to appreciate? --> Your directness. You're highly goal-oriented and always come in with a clear plan. In the first week, I often thought, “This could get interesting.” 6️⃣ What’s one moment you questioned working with me? --> Yes, during one of our first discussions about our target group and ICP. It was tough, and to be honest, it sometimes felt like a bet. ""If we go through with this, it could go really well, or we could lose just everything."" But in the end, you were right. Honestly, that was the hope when we brought you in. 7️⃣ What do I do that makes you feel genuinely supported? --> You never just criticized, you always thought things through, pushed alongside us, and gave 100%, even as an external. I always said: we don’t need just a consultant who talks, we need someone who puts on the boots and gets things done. 8️⃣ What advice from me took time to sink in? --> Focus on one clear ICP. Digging deep instead of trying to be everything to everyone was a game-changer. But it took time to fully understand just how critical that really was. 9️⃣ If someone new were about to work with me, what would you warn them about? --> Get ready for speed, straight talk, and questions that push you way out of your comfort zone. 🔟 What’s something you wish I did more of? What do you wish I did less of? --> I would’ve loved to have more office time together. Those in-between conversations were incredibly helpful for me.

Hear me out, I don't mean that you need to be your startup AE forever. But ✅ Founder-led sales isn't a phase you graduate from—it's your permanent responsibility. Your founder role will evolve. Here are 6 phases in which you'll evolve 1️⃣ Finding Poblem-Solution Fit -> Here, you're personally validating that customers will pay for your solution. -> The focus is on having real conversations that lead to paying customers. 2️⃣ Acquiring First Customers -> Focus on creating a repeatable process for finding and closing customers here. -> You're personally closing deals and beginning to recognize patterns in what works. You are acquiring customers for the purpose of learning, until the process becomes repeatable. → This phase is not about scaling. It mostly is about doing non-scalable things to learn and get 1-2 channels performing. 3️⃣ Making your first sales hire -> Don't think of this as your escape from sales. -> Here, you transition out of 'solo' selling to supplement and accelerate what's already working because you are at capacity. 4️⃣ Making It Predictable -> Focus on creating a truly predictable process with clear KPIs and conversion metrics -> You can build sales methodologies and reverse engineer your sales forecast at this stage. 5️⃣ Multiple Sales Hires -> Once your process is repeatable and predictable, bring on additional salespeople who can succeed within your established framework. 6️⃣ Hiring a Sales Leader -> The right time to hire a sales leader is when a handful of people on the sales team are already executing. -> But you, the founder/CEO stay the CRO, no matter what, always managing that sales leader. 🔑 By following these phases in order, you become a competent sales leader yourself before hiring one.

Sales enablement is transitioning from ❌ Building content libraries and sales training to ✅ Helping your buyers make better, faster, and more confident decisions. So I've asked Marc Grewenig what's working in 2025. 7 ways to enable your buyers and win more deals along the way 👇 1️⃣ Create a Content Hub Make your content findable, not just available. -> Create a hub to locate the right content at the right time, in the right context. And no: It's not 73 folders in Sharepoint. 2️⃣ Enable your buyer’s champion, Your champions sell internally. Give them what they need to make the case when you’re NOT in the room. 3️⃣ Ditch the one-pagers. -> Build decision customer portals that give buyers a place to align, explore, and decide. -> Use tools like emlen to help you with this. 4️⃣ Treat your buyers like customers (even before they pay) A great experience isn’t just post-sale support. It’s clarity, trust, and ease, from the first interaction. 5️⃣ Don’t just track engagement. Act on it. Views are vanity. But seeing who engages with what – and reacting fast – wins deals. 6️⃣ Respect their time. Simplify their path. Every unnecessary meeting, email, or file slows your buyers down. -> Reduce friction. Increase momentum. 7️⃣ Be present, without being pushy. The best enablement feels invisible, helpful, personal, and available on demand. Treat Buyer Enablement as the new Sales Enablement. Your reps will thank you. Your buyers will too. 👇 How do you enable your buyers & sales team? P.S.

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7327573567070420992/,"How Moritz Weiss turned Customer success from reactive support to proactive customer success and #1 source for referrals. ❌ Everyone makes the mistake of seeing CSM as a reactive function. ✅ But the real opportunity lies in turning it into a proactive referral engine. I've worked with Moritz and the whole Ayunis / Locaboo for 2+ years - building the GTM foundation and growing the company beyond €1 million ARR. And a big part of the success has been referrals. So I asked Moritz if he wants to share the secrets we implemented over the last months. (He has been handling more than 600 customers in the DACH region for Ayunis / Locaboo ) Here's the process to build a strong CS Referral engine 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟭: Customer check-ins -> Schedule regular check-in calls with your customers. -> We assigned a dedicated CS manager to each customer. -> Make it a point to actively ask questions about their experience during every contact you have with customers. -> This sets a good foundation to get in the referral mindset. 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟮: Draft the perfect script -> Prepare a script that you can use to request referrals on these customer calls. 🚨 Getting the right referrals depends a LOT on how you ask for them. So make sure you have the right script. 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟯: Set referrals as a KPI -> Set monthly referral targets for each Customer Success Manager. -> Actively report and track them within the team. 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟰: Pool referrals in a single place -> Build a dedicated Slack channel in which all referrals are shared transparently and celebrated. 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟱: Involve sales in the process -> Forward these referrals to sales as warm leads. -> Our SDR teams proactively reach out to warm recommendations. Bonus: Build awareness on how your customers refer other clients. In our case we know: -> They know other cities around them (so you can prepare for the calls and know who they might know) -> They work closely with other departments (so we know how to get warm intros to other departments) You're missing out if you are not actively engaging with your customers and building a referral engine around them. 👇 How do you use CS for referrals?

Not a product training. -> Focus only on top 3-4 features that matter to your prospect. ❌ 𝗠𝘆𝘁𝗵 𝟱: We do all channels at the same time - Outbound, Content, PPC, SEO, Events, Affiliates... -> Each channel works differently and takes up resources. -> Do smaller tests to figure which channels work and go all in on just those. ❌ 𝗠𝘆𝘁𝗵 𝟲: We don’t have any competition -> Every company has competition. -> Look at your indirect competitors and status quo if you can't find direct competitors. ❌ 𝗠𝘆𝘁𝗵 𝟳: We lose deals because we are too expensive -> Actually, most startups undercharge. -> It's not your pricing, it's how you package your product and value.

Start with initial customers (beachhead segment) and then scale from there. ❌ Your ICP changes over time --> You will have multiple different ICPs over time. The 'ideal' customers in the 0 to 100k € is different than your 'ideal' customers from 1€ million to 5€ million etc. So create a mindset that your 'ideal customer' is ideal until you reach the next milestone. ❌ TAM vs. ICP And also remember, your TAM is not your ideal customer profile. Especially if you’re VC-funded and talk a lot about the HUGE market, it’s a common mistake. Your TAM is something you will (eventually) win in 5+ years, but not today.

It's harder, though, to track them when no one's checking on your progress. So 4 weeks ago Maximilian Antosch and I started this thing called ""accountability buddy"" It's not a new concept.

So I deeply enjoyed writing a guide on hiring your first GTM person with SaaS recruiting experts Machiel Kunst and Elvin Kingma . We created a list of characteristics to look for 👇 Hiring the right first salesperson for your business can have a multiplier effect, while hiring the wrong first salesperson creates the opposite effect. Getting this first profile correct is fundamental. What NOT to look for in a pioneer or founding AE: Filter out candidates who ❌ Come from big companies —> They have a hard time to adapt to a fast-moving start-up culture ❌ Lack of product knowledge —> A lot of (senior) sales reps, if they start working in an early-stage start-up, don't really (invest enough time) to understand the product. ❌ Not willing to become an industry expert --> This point is closely related to point 2. If your sales rep is not willing to dive deep into the industry/ problem of customers, that's a bad sign. ❌ Not keen on building an industry network --> Word of mouth, warm intros, high-touch relationships with customers are key growth strategies in the early stage. It’s super important they want to grow their industry-relevant network ❌ Always sell with massive discounts --> Only being able to sell with massive discounts is a sign of lacking sales skills. ❌ Competition-focused --> The wrong sales reps spend too much time comparing with the competition and blame missing product features for unsuccessful sales performance. ❌ Lack accountability & blames others --> Wrong sales reps blame others (product, marketing...) and miss accountability for hitting their goals. ❌ Don't have a growth mindset --> Early-stage sales is a tough game. Mostly, you try to convince customers of an early (buggy) MVP. You need to be creative, smart, and always find new ways. Instead, do LOOK for people who: ✅ Have startup experience ✅ Can prospect from scratch (full-cycle) ✅ Have a strong track record ✅ are Challenger Sellers ✅ Have grit & adaptibility ✅ Have a willingness to build, test, execute Disclaimer: I did not check all boxes (haven't had a strong track record/sales experience), but I guess most of them at least 😀 Did I?

The transition from founder sales to founder-led sales is not easy. Avoid these 9 most common hiring mistakes👇 1️⃣ Not implementing a sales methodology --> Your way of doing sales as a founder might seem structured to you, but it’s hard to replicate. 2️⃣ Not setting realistic goals --> Overambitious quotas have the opposite effect of a higher level of revenue. 3️⃣ Hiring the wrong Pioneer AE --> People from ""big companies"" have most likely not been in the trenches often. 4️⃣ Hiring a sales leader before hitting PMF --> Most haven’t been hands-on for a while and shouldn't be your first GTM hire. 5️⃣ Hiring strategic leaders too early --> Executor >>> someone who only strategizes 6️⃣ Hiring ""cheap"" salespeople --> Don't try to save money by hiring less experienced people. You don't have the required resources to train them. 7️⃣ Being slow in hiring process --> Speed matters. The best candidates get multiple offers within weeks. 8️⃣ Founder stop selling too soon --> You still need to be involved in sales, even after your first hire. 9️⃣ Neglecting cultural fit --> Don't hire purely based on experience.

But first of all: What is Social Listening? --> Social Listening is the process of monitoring online conversations (on LinkedIn, X , Reddit Slack etc. about your brand, product, and industry, Usually via tracking certain keywords And why is this relevant for early-stage SaaS? Social listening lets you: ✅ Discover early leads --> You can find people actively asking for the solution you offer or complaining about a competitor, and get on their radar organically. ✅ Get unfiltered feedback --> People are often brutally honest on social media and forums. This feedback is gold for refining your product and messaging. ✅ Build brand awareness --> By participating in conversations, you start to be seen as part of the community, not just an ad in the sidebar ✅ Inform product and marketing strategy --> Patterns in discussions can reveal what features users care about, what language they use, where they spend their time, and how they compare options, guiding your product roadmap and marketing strategy. ✅ Collect testimonials --> Organic mentions of your product are a great way to collect first testimonials Okay, so how to do this the right way? 4 steps to monitor (high-intent) mentions Step 1️⃣: Identify key channels --> where your audience and industry peers are most active. LinkedIn, Slack, Youtube, X, you name it. Step 2️⃣: Define the keywords --> you need to track your brand name, product categories, competitor names, industry terms and specific pain points. Step 3️⃣: Monitoring your channels --> With a social listening tool like Octolens or manually to find relevant conversations based on the keywords. Alternatives to consider: Google alert, F5bot, Brand24 , Mention , Brandwatch, Hootsuite Step 4️⃣: Take action --> respond quickly and relevant to mentions that matter (both positive and negative) or learn from it (e.g., add a new feature). Make sure to povide Value First instead of pitching immediately or just dropping the link to your product and Be Transparent About Who You Are --> If you’re the founder, say so—it builds credibility.

Review pricing quarterly --> Treat pricing as the pricing for 'now' that brings you to the next milestone. 3. Plan 'deep work' sessions --> Especially if you feel like you never have time to get things done 4. Collect testimonials in a folder --> Build an internal testimonial hub that you can use for marketing. 5. Leverage your network for warm intros --> Sounds easy, but most don't do this properly. 6. Record your sales calls --> Analyze regularly your calls and ask someone else to review it (I do this with every founder I work with) 7. Turn customer calls into content --> Take notes of calls. Every question and objection can be worth a post/content. 8. Analyze your top KPIs weekly & monthly --> Define the key steps (visits, leads, MQL, SQL, won/lost etc.) and analyze what's working and what's not (tracking alone is not enough).

Not Disclosing Founder/Employee Role ❌ Don't hide your role. ✅ State who you are and why you’re recommending your own product. 3.

These keywords focus on users already very much aware and ‘in the market’. Together with Colin van den Berg we summarized 10 High-buying intent keyword categories for SaaS 1️⃣ (Tool-Specific) Pain Point/Problem Keywords “How to transcribe a webinar recording” 2️⃣ Pricing & Cost-Related Keywords Example: “Affordable webinar software for startups"" or ""Free webinar tools"" 3️⃣ Comparison & Alternative Keywords Example: “Zoom vs. Livestorm” 4️⃣ Competitor-Specific Keywords Example: “Zoom vs. Livestorm”: Which is better for small businesses?” 5️⃣ Feature-Specific Keywords Example: “Webinar with breakout room feature” 6️⃣ Integration Keywords Example: “Best Webinar tool to integrate with Hubspot / Webflow” 7️⃣ Product Category (+ Target Audience/Usecase) Keywords Example: “Best Webinar tool for product demos” or “Best Webinar tool for startups” 8️⃣ Benefit-Driven Keywords Example: “How much time can we increase participant engagement with webinar software?” 9️⃣ Educational Keywords Example: “How to launch an on-demand product demo on my SaaS website?” 🔟 Template-Based Keywords Example: “Webinar sign-up page templates?” The good thing. Tools like Semrush make it easy to spot the right keyword opportunities. Step 1: Analyze your competitors Add the URL to Semrush Go to organic keywords Filter by high-intent keywords Scan for keywords with: - high intent (Commercial intent) - Keyword difficulty 50 - ideally good volume Step 2: Use the keyword finder Add your product category to Semrush. I added 'webinar software'. Then apply KD and Intent filters. And in under 1 hour, you have a high-intent keyword list. 👉 Want to deep dive?

You can practically use every touchpoint with a prospect/customer to get warm intros. Best part? You only need LinkedIn for this. Here are 3 LinkedIn playbooks to run your referral programs - 1️⃣ Getting referrals/intros from your sales conversations --> Before you get on sales calls, use LinkedIn to scan their network for ICPs. --> During the call, ask them if they know someone who can benefit from your product. --> In case they don’t know anyone, mention names from your list and ask for an intro. 2️⃣ Getting referrals/intros from your network --> Tap into the network of your closed group (e.g. investors, employees, partners, friends) and scan their LinkedIn connections for ICPs. --> Shortlist people you want to get connected to, share the list with your closed group, and ask them for introductions. 3️⃣ Getting referrals/intros from your existing customers - --> Same play as above. Search for relevant connections of your customers, shortlist relevant people, and ask for an intro. 💡This also works the other way around. Meaning if there's someone you’re NOT yet connected with, you can use Sales Navigator to get a list of people who could make an intro for you. While these are fairly easy steps to execute, The success of referral programs depends highly on *how* you ask for them.

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7311662481976770560/,"4 ways to find testimonials and case studies 👇 Most SaaS founders think testimonials have to be formal quotes collected via surveys or emails. But in reality, testimonials are happening all around you. Here’s where to look👇 1️⃣ Organic Mentions People talk about products they love, even when you’re not asking them to. Scan for mentions: - Social media (LinkedIn, X, Reddit, YouTube) - Community discussions (Slack, Discord, Product Hunt) - Emails, LinkedIn DM & Slack messages from happy users Tools like Octolens are helpful. 2️⃣ User Reviews & Ratings If you’re listed on G2, Capterra, Trustpilot, or AppSumo, start collecting positive reviews and featuring them on your site. Tools like reviewflowz are helpful. 3️⃣ Live Chat & Support Messages Users often leave positive feedback in support chats. Keep track and ask for permission to use those as testimonials. 4️⃣ Proactively collect testimonials Goal: Build a small portfolio of case studies that you can then strategically use for sales: ✅ a case study for each use case (in case your product covers more)* ✅ a case study for different industries/customer types* ✅ a case study for different benefits (example: One on x% time saving; the other one on y% increase in revenue)* How: Identify best-fit customers and proactively reach out to them. For PLG: Quick, casual email outreach. For SLG: Ask them for a 15-minute customer interview Romana Kuts and I share the email templates in our Case Study guide on mrrunlocked.com 5️⃣ Bonus: Turn them into multiple case study formats A great case study doesn’t have to be a 5-page PDF buried somewhere on your website. --> Written Case studies Make them easily (ungated) accessible on your website. Canva, Attio and Amplemarket have great case studies --> Wall of Love A ""Wall of Love"" is a dedicated page where all your best testimonials live, creating instant social proof. Tools like Testimonial are helpful --> Video Case Studies Video is more engaging than text. Either video-interview your customers (& record) or let them record a video (user-recorded). Calendy runs a great video case study page. Tools like Trust - #1 Video Testimonial Platform are powerful.

Here's what you need to tell potential customers through your sales deck: ✅ how they currently do ‘usecase’ ✅ what the problem and limitations of this are (why it matters) ✅ how they overcome the current situation using your product ✅ what they will achieve (results) ✅ that they can trust you and that they are not alone (social proof) Fix these and share your results with me.

Tactic 4-7 focus on high-intent prospects (aka. demand capture) Tactic 8-9 is a bit of demand generation. 1️⃣ Network sales - Reach out to people in your network. 2️⃣ Warm intros - Ask your investors, advisors, friends, etc. for intros. One of your best bets. - These convert MUCH faster than cold ones 3️⃣ Referrals - Ask your first customers (and even prospects) for intros. This depends a LOT on HOW you ask them. - Make sure you make it easy for them to refer you. 4️⃣ Founder-led LinkedIn - Post daily and ENGAGE with your audience to build awareness about your product. - Treat your profile as a landing page for potential customers. 5️⃣ Social selling - Track intent and reach out to ICPs. - This includes profile views, likes, comments 6️⃣ Creating 'BOFU' content - Create alternative & comparison pages (for existing product categories). - Works great in rather crowded red-ocean markets with existing demand. 7️⃣ Paid Search - Bet on high-intent keywords on Google. 8️⃣ Influencer partnerships - Engage with 3-5 relevant experts. - Give them access to your product and let them do their magic in promoting it. 9️⃣ Niche newsletter sponsorships - Find newsletters that are read by your target audience.

But make it easy for people to ‘take action’. ✅ Comment on your posts' comments - --> Don’t be lazy after posting. The first 30-60 minutes after you post on LinkedIn is crucial for engagement. --> So if people engage with your post, make sure that you respond to their comments. --> The best you can do is to create a thread/discussion on your posts.

So how can you go about it? Let's look at a few tactics that can help you with this - ✅ Value Commenting - --> Comment on at least 2-3 posts per day from leaders + influencers in your niche. Make sure you add value (no AI repetition) --> If their posts receive millions of views, and you leave the best comment, many of those views will also come your way. ✅ Helping instead of selling - --> Nobody likes the feeling of being sold to, but everyone appreciates valuable support. --> Focus on solving problems of your ICP through relevant posts and comments, sales will naturally follow. ✅ Have your ICP Supporters - --> Have a list of 3-5 people who add relevant comments to your posts in the FIRST hours after you post. This helps boost reach. --> The best way is to let them know on WhatsApp/Slack that you have a new post. ✅ Run campaigns with cold leads - --> If you don’t yet have a relevant network, your focus should be on building one and becoming visible. --> Send 200 connection requests per week to your ICP. Send a highly personalized message else don't send anything at all (if you don't have anything relevant) ✅ Run campaigns with warm leads - --> They are your best opportunities and should always be the priority. --> If someone engages with your LinkedIn profile, comments on a post, or sends you a connection request, this is a great opportunity to start a conversation. The sooner, the better. These were only few of the tactics that you can use to expand your reach on LinkedIn. Make engagement a CORE of your LI strategy and not an afterthought!

If your product solves a ✅ Clearly defined problem that ✅ potential customers actively Google, You can reap significant rewards by ranking in search results. Otherwise, OTHER channels will make more sense to you. Let's unpack 6 criteria that make you FIT for SEO - 1️⃣ People are actively searching for keywords related to ‘your solution' --> ""SEO works best when people already search for solutions in your space"" 2️⃣ Your competitors are ranking and getting (high) traffic from SEO --> Their success proves there’s demand, and with the right strategy, you can compete for a share of that traffic. 3️⃣ You rely on recurring revenue and a scalable growth model --> Companies with a solid lifetime value (LTV) can justify upfront SEO investments. 4️⃣ You’re prepared to invest in content --> Organic growth is driven by high-value, solution-oriented content. --> Your team should be equipped for consistent high-quality content production 5️⃣ You can tolerate a 6–12-month ramp-up --> SEO is cumulative - you won’t rank overnight. --> But in the long run it can deliver an ever-growing stream of qualified visitors 6️⃣ You want to reduce paid acquisition costs --> Ads can work in the short run but get expensive as you scale. --> SEO is ideal for lowering your overall Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) in the long term. If this sounds like you - you should give SEO a shot.

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7304758197045653504/,"We recommend finding high-intent keywords (aka. money-keywords) for your product. These money keywords focus on users that are already very much aware and ‘in the market’. Here’s a list of 11 high-buying intent keyword categories. 1️⃣ (Tool-Specific) Pain Point/Problem Keywords Why: High intent & low competition. Example: “How to export contacts from LinkedIn” (for a lead scraping tool) or “How to follow up with leads without being pushy” (for a CRM software) 2️⃣ Pricing & Cost-Related Keywords Why: Strong purchase intent. Users searching for pricing are near decision-making. Example: “Affordable CRM for solopreneurs” 3️⃣ Comparison & Alternative Keywords Why: Steal market share from competitors. These users already know they need a solution—they’re just deciding which one to pick. Example: “Notion vs. Asana” | “Best alternatives for HubSpot” 4️⃣ Competitor-Specific Keywords Why: Convert users already aware of similar products. These searches indicate high purchase intent. Example: “HubSpot CRM vs. Salesforce: Which is better for small businesses?” 5️⃣ Feature-Specific Keywords Why: Target users looking for specific capabilities. Users searching for specific features have clear buying intent and are comparing options. Example: “CRM with VOIP calling” 6️⃣ Integration Keywords Why: Users want tools that fit their existing tech stack. If your SaaS integrates well, it’s a strong conversion driver. Example:“Best payroll software that integrates with QuickBooks” 7️⃣ Product Category (+ Target Audience) Keywords Why: Relevance & niche targeting (especially for vertical SaaS). Helps attract highly relevant traffic but may have lower search volume. Example: “AI tools for law firms” | “Best project management tool for remote teams” 8️⃣ Benefit-Driven Keywords Why: ROI-focused searches. Users want to justify their investment—case studies & ROI calculators work well here. Example: “How much time can I save with a virtual assistant?” 9️⃣ Educational Keywords Why: Guide users through the buying process Example: “How to create a high-converting SaaS homepage” or “How to get started with SEO” 🔟 Location-Based Keywords (If Relevant) Why: Capture localized demand. High intent if applicable, but not relevant unless your SaaS serves specific regions. Example: “Best invoicing software for German freelancers” 1️⃣1️⃣ Template-Based Keywords Why: Lead magnets & backlinks. Great for lead generation & content marketing but low direct buying intent (unless templates are built in your tool / specifically for your tool) Example: “Best LinkedIn post templates for SaaS founders” On Sunday, Colin van den Berg and I deep-dived into SEO for early-stage SaaS founders on mrrunlocked.com hashtag # saas hashtag # seo hashtag # founders",7mo,86,16,10,Yes,image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQGT1d37T1aCNg/feedshare-shrink_800/B4EZV.2qj3GYAg-/0/1741590015107?e=1762992000&v=beta&t=rgPVex9ef73BiyKelLTkMKdZFTVEIVktSVaW4oBAucA

How to analyze your early customers to find your ICP in 5 steps 👇 WHY Niching Down at all??? “trying to sell to everyone who'll pay is the slowest path to 1€M, or at least the slowest to 10€M ARR” Would you rather be: 1️⃣A small fish fighting for survival in a big pond (aka. your TAM) or 2️⃣a big fish in a small pond (aka. dominating a sub-segment of your SOM) The math is simple. Let's say you're targeting a 100M€ market. - If you capture 10% of a niche, that's 10M€. - If you try to capture 1% of a 1B€ market, that's also 10M€ But here's the kicker: capturing 10% of a focused market is WAY easier than capturing 1% of a broad market. Serving multiple different segments at the same time is time and resource-intensive. Each customer segment you serve requires its own: ❌ Value proposition & messaging ❌ Sales playbook ❌ Product features ❌ Support processes Additionally, every time you add a new segment, you build a new GTM motion. ❌ Different content ❌ Different channels ❌ Different sales approaches ❌ Different success metrics And guess what? Your small team can't execute multiple GTM motions effectively. To validate your ICP, you need to: 1️⃣Collect data of your customers 2️⃣Break down your customer base into segments and 3️⃣Analyze them against metrics that are indicators of ‘better fit’ We call them ‘‘better-fit’ Indicators (aka. Winning indicators). Generally speaking, your ‘best-fit’ customers: 💪 have higher product engagement 💪 show better commercial metrics 💪 are less support intense 💪 are better aligned with your strategy and values/culture On Sunday we, Daniel Zsolt Rényi and I published a deep dive on the 5 Steps to Identify Your ICP on Mrrunlocked. hashtag # saas hashtag # gtm hashtag # idealcustomerprofile",8mo,244,36,16,Yes,image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQEBdaKeAxq6ug/feedshare-shrink_800/B4DZU75_GaGkAk-/0/1740466812170?e=1762992000&v=beta&t=H3hrm8CBe4b_b_KgCvdrydzINOjC77ENepv19vWys0Q

Each customer segment you serve requires its own: - Value proposition & messaging - Sales playbook - Product features - Support processes maybe even skills & talents, etc. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Along with these, every time you add a new segment, you're essentially building a new GTM motion. Each motion requires: ❌ Different content ❌ Different channels ❌ Different sales approaches ❌ Different success metrics And guess what? Your small team can't execute multiple GTM motions effectively. You'll end up doing everything poorly instead of one thing exceptionally well. Here's what happens when you chase every potential customer: ❌ Marketing messages become generic and forgettable ❌ Sales cycles get longer and more unpredictable ❌ Product development gets pulled in multiple directions ❌ Customer success becomes a constant firefight ❌ Churn increases as you fail to deliver specific value Neither fun, nor desirable. The path to 1€ and then to 10€M ARR isn't about maximizing your total addressable market. It's about dominating a specific segment. When you focus on one specific segment: ✅ Your marketing message becomes crystal clear ✅ Your sales team becomes highly efficient ✅ Your product roadmap gets laser-focused ✅ Your customer success becomes predictable ✅ Your referrals start flowing naturally Most importantly, you build deep expertise in solving specific problems for specific customers. This expertise compounds over time, creating a moat that competitors can't easily cross.

(at least I hope so, there is always a small chance that analytics is broken). But these people had: ❌ 0 email opens the last 6 months ❌ no link clicks ❌ no comments, shares or post views So high chance they are 'inactive' subscribers.

But it's also something you can't skip! Because ICP mapping is one of the foundations of scaling your SaaS from 0-1mil ARR and beyond So how can you streamline this process to make it easier? The key lies in segmentation🔑 It's a 2-part process where you - 1️⃣ Set your ""Obvious Filters"" Segment your customers in CORE groups, based on criteria that you deem are most important for YOUR business. These include (but are not restricted to) - ✅ Industry ✅ Tech Stack ✅ Company Size ✅ Geography 2️⃣ Enhance these with ""Advanced Filters"" Surface-level segments often reveal initial patterns - but rarely the full picture. To make your segmentation foolproof - Layer on advanced filters that correlate with VALUE. These include - ✅ Vertical Specific (metrics specific to your vertical) ✅ User Persona (who uses your product) ✅ Use-Case (how they use it) ✅ Customer pain point (their main challenges) You're already half way into mapping your ICP if you are able to segment your customers in these groups.

You know the ""Hustle Mode"" very well, especially in the early days of building your SaaS. You're scrappy, and doing everything possible to land your first 10/100 customers. However, these first customers are your ECPs (Early Customer Profile). They tend to be: ✅solution-aware, ✅experimental, ✅and in the market. They are most likely DIFFERENT from your ICPs (your ultimate goal). Your ICPs tend to be: ❌not yet solution aware, ❌require proof of work and ❌are hard(er) to reach. At some point, you need to pause Hustle Mode. You need to start tapping into your ICP and that road is THROUGH your ECP. How can you achieve this? It's a 3-step process 1️⃣ Collect data about your customers Example - Firmographic, technographic, product usage 2️⃣ Segment your early customers based on various criteria relevant to your business Example - Industry, size, customer pain points, use-cases, tech stack, etc. 3️⃣ Map these segments against key ""winning indicators"" of your best-fit customers Example - higher NPS, shorter sales cycle, higher ACV, higher product engagement, etc. Remember, the goal of this exercise is to go from Hustle Mode (ECP) to Focus mode (ICP) so you can scale to 1M / 10M ARR faster. Sounds like a huge task? Don't worry, on our upcoming MRRUnlocked, episodes, we, Daniel Zsolt Rényi and I walk you through the step-by-step process to achieve this. --- Link to the newsletter in the comments.

Dark social refers to social media activities that cannot be attributed to a specific channel And are not trackable by conventional analytics tools. It includes private communication channels such as Messaging apps, emails, or direct messages, where content is shared without a traceable source. To track leads and generated pipeline, we recommend that every company include a self-attribution field in their book a demo/sign-up form to determine where the lead is coming from.

In a nutshell, do this: ✅ Product Category positioning: if you’re building a product in an established market → Good indicator: you will find a category on G2, Capterra, etc. and there’s existing search demand on Google & co. ✅ Usecase positioning: you’re building a product in a rather new market (blue ocean); no established product category has been built yet. → Good indicator: No product category on G2, Capterra, etc. 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟰: 𝗔𝗱𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗾𝘂𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 (𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗹𝗲) Now you need to add 1 or more of the 6 SaaS positioning options. 1️⃣ Niche down Finding an (underserved) segment of the market and building the best tool for them. Most of the time it's vertical-specific tools. 2️⃣ Low-cost player Mostly in a more crowded market when market leaders increase their prices (a lot), you have the chance to build a low-cost version of it. 3️⃣ Premium-player Serve clients that need more human touch (customer service, sales demos...). You can position yourself as the premium player. 4️⃣ Unique benefit You have something very unique that no one else has. This can be a specific feature or the fact that you serve a specific market better (e.g. being GDPR compliant, if you sell to DACH market) Some other examples are: 🔸 Proprietary Technology (e.g. AI-driven) 🔸 Special expertise (e.g. founded by ex-XX) 🔸 Better support (e.g. dedicated account manager 24/7) 🔸 Speed of delivery(e.g. Quick onboarding with pre-built project templates) 5️⃣ Being the 'lite' version of something complex You serve a customer segment that doesn't need the heavy, complex market leader (e.g. Salesforce or Adobe). 6️⃣ Mix of the above Of course, each of the elements can be mixed. --- Thanks Robert Kaminski 🎯 & Anthony Pierri 🎸 for this great visual (as always!) 🙌",8mo,42,3,4,Yes,image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQFHBct095D5Qg/feedshare-shrink_800/B4EZTU6NYIGwAg-/0/1738738817308?e=1762992000&v=beta&t=eKiw7oP7zv74ih3FdnlWYzYw5k4ujclqWoZsS4nvd08

By leveraging their personal brand, founders can: ✅ attract inbound opportunities, ✅ increase brand awareness, ✅ build trust, ✅ and position themselves as industry leaders. LinkedIn thought leadership enables founders to build trust (at scale). Which is especially important for early-stage founders who usually lack social proof and brand trust at the beginning of their journey. But let’s take a closer look at the advantages of LinkedIn thought leadership for SaaS companies: 1️⃣ Positioning in the Niche To be seen as an expert in your market segment, you need to establish a clear and strategic position in your prospects' minds. 2️⃣ Shortened Sales Cycles A strong LinkedIn presence builds trust long before your sales team reaches out. 3️⃣ Stronger Customer Retention Existing customers want to see you stay relevant and provide continuous value. 4️⃣ Inbound Leads With the right content strategy, potential customers will reach out to you. 5️⃣ Partnerships & PR Increased visibility leads to strategic collaborations and media opportunities. 6️⃣ Owning Your Audience Building your audience reduces dependency on paid ads and shifting platform algorithms.

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7278303739998830593/,"What channels are right for my SaaS? The right GTM channel(s) for your SaaS depends on view criteria. ✅ Your ACV (annual contract value) —> Some channels are just more expensive than others. Your pricing needs to justify the cost of the acquisitions. ✅ Stage of the company —> Focus on direct channels first. The feedback and learnings you get interacting with your clients are super valuable. Content, Outbound, and Paid search gives you immediate feedback. Also, some channels are very expensive (e.g. out of home) or take a long time to establish (e.g. strategic partnerships), and because of that are not available for most early-stage startups. ✅ Product Complexity —> If your product is rather complex, buyers prefer more education and human interaction (aka. sales-led). This comes with higher ACVs and impacts your choice of the right GTM channels. If your product is low in complexity, the opposite is true, which means SEO, affiliates, marketplaces, etc. can work quite well. ✅ Maturity of the market —> If you are building a product in an established market, you can bet on existing demand. This means people are actively looking for solutions, so review platforms, paid search, and affiliates are channels with a good fit. In comparison, if most of your buyers are not aware, you need to educate the market. This means you need to bet on channels that enable you to do so (e.g. outbound, owned content, events, etc.) ✅ Team/Founder Skills —> Some call it founder-model fit. Trust on (early) GTM channels that you can master well. 👇 What channel work best for you?",10mo,56,3,4,Yes,image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQFoqvPNuNDjUg/feedshare-shrink_800/B4EZQG6mdhHsAg-/0/1735282813979?e=1762992000&v=beta&t=rJj1OFug1iCogWSR_R95VOiYTyhBy5jXGI7tta9rF3I

But it’s best if you think about how you can best distribute your content so that a lot of your ICP audience gets in touch with it. Here are some methods to keep in mind: ✅ Share your content on relevant communities But please stop just posting the link. Instead, provide value by answering related questions and link to your content as a full-length article on that topic) ✅ Have a small group of ambassadors These are people who engage with your posts on LinkedIn. They should be relevant to your audience. Ask them to interact with your content. ✅ Share content in your outreach Can you add your content to your latest prospecting campaign? If your content is valuable, then you should like the idea :) ✅ Cross Promo of Content Reach out to relevant industry experts, clients, influencers, newsletters, blogs, etc., and ask them to share your content. If it’s relevant there is a high chance they are happy to help. ✅ Promote via paid channels If you see that your content performs well, you could even think about adding paid channels on top. ✅ Equip your employees with content More and more SaaS startups equip their employees with content so they can all build their online brands. Ask your employees if they want to contribute to your content marketing. ✅ REPURPOSE your content Again, distribution is also about repurposing.

A great opportunity to get these ‘warm intros’ are ALL your interactions with your existing customers AND also prospects - It’s called Referral sales. The goal of referral sales is: ✅ getting your existing customers (and prospects) to give you contact information (ideally including introductions) of other relevant leads in their network, plus ✅ using their names when contacting new leads.

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7274679762202112001/,"Last week I had a power hour call about SaaS pricing with an early-stage SaaS founder. Here are 3 things we covered in 60 minutes 👇 1️⃣ Pricing value metric Most important thing in pricing is deciding on your value metric. What is *the thing' that you charge for. Traditionally these are metrics like: - users - storage - transactions - leads - bookings ... Choosing your value metric is key. A powerful value metric combines the following 3 characteristics: ✅ Easy to understand ✅ aligned with the customers’ value of using your product ✅ Scalable and grows with customers’ usage of your product To keep it simple choose 1 value metric. And not 2 or 3. 2️⃣ Packaging If you follow a value-based pricing with 1 value metric, you need to decide if you charge: - for every single unit of the value metric (aka. usage based pricing) or pre-package them (aka. tiered pricing). Example: Charge 5€ per unit vs. 100€ for up to 20 units. 3️⃣ Price point Patrick Campell said “In the beginning, the actual number you're charging isn't that important. There are some exceptions, but for the most part, you should first be figuring out the range you're in: a $10 product, $100 product, $1k product, etc. Don't waste time debating $500 vs. $505, because this doesn't matter as much until you have a stronger foundation beneath you.” We did the following 2 things: ✅ Competitor benchmark --> They operated in a crowded mature market. So checking direct competitors for reference was a good indicator. ✅ Calculation for value (10x rule) --> We did a calculation on the value the product provides. The 10x rule said that you should charge 10% of the value. While we fully focused on pricing, the founders realized that pricing is part of the overall GTM strategy. Because we always talked about: 👉 Who are you selling to 👉 What are the alternatives & direct competitors 👉 How are you different from them 👉 How do you sell (PLG vs. Sales led) If you want to learn more about pricing, check out my full SaaS pricing guide for early stage SaaS products.",10mo,26,4,0,No,,

Without quality backlinks, ranking and competing in organic search is hard. 2️⃣ How can early-stage SaaS startups with limited resources prioritize link building? --> Start with foundational, high-quality links. Avoid low-cost link vendors, which can harm your site. Start by running start-up PR campaigns, resource pages like chamber of commerce, asking friends with sites in similar niches for links, and journalist enablement tools like Connectively or Qwoted. 3️⃣ 4 Tips for Early Link Building Success --> Focus on SEO basics: quality content and solid site structure. --> Set up internal links to direct authority to key pages. --> Build “linkable assets” like long-form, data-driven content. --> Start with easy wins—local links, PR, and connections in similar niches. 4️⃣ Should SaaS startups focus on quantity or quality in link building? --> Quality matters more. A highly relevant DR30 link from a quality site is better than a DR60 link from an irrelevant page on a broad site. But a natural-looking mix is best. 5️⃣ How can SaaS companies stand out in niche-specific link building? --> Create unique content. Editors in your niche value expert insights and new perspectives, so develop well-researched, expert-supported content to stand out. 6️⃣ What types of content attract high-quality backlinks for SaaS startups? --> Data-driven content is most effective. Surveys, reports, and expert round-ups generate more links than general blog posts. 7️⃣ What are 5 common Link-Building Pitfalls for SaaS Startups? ❌ Using link farms or low-quality marketplaces—this risks penalties. ❌ Building links without strong SEO basics, like good internal links and keyword-focused content. ❌ Relying on junior marketers for link building often yields poor results. ❌ Choosing low-quality agencies that prioritize profit over quality. ❌ Not diversifying your link acquisition tactics 8️⃣ When is the ‘right’ timing to start investing in link building? Pre or Post Product-Market fit? --> Begin once you have a product roadmap, target keywords, and initial content. 9️⃣ How can SaaS startups measure link-building success? --> Track backlink quality, organic traffic, and keyword rankings. Good-quality links should improve rankings over time. But ensure solid content and site structure are in place to support these efforts. -- Check out dofollow.com for hands-on support with backlinks. hashtag # sponsored",11mo,26,2,8,Yes,image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQHOO6KuygDGcA/feedshare-shrink_800/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1732690851420?e=1762992000&v=beta&t=VSFAZgA5KWfkuOKQ6UdIcBxHjyO8vgwI3Hb6fJb6S8A

They could not clearly articulate who their ICP is. Why? Because they have 146 clients, but never really started to analyze them. So here is what we did. Enrich their client list with relevant data. In this case it meant: 1️⃣ contract value 2️⃣ payment schedule (monthly, yearly) 3️⃣ title of decision maker 4️⃣ amount of user 5️⃣ sales cycle (in days) 6️⃣ product usage 7️⃣ source 8️⃣ industry 9️⃣ size of company 🔟 what they used before The goal? To find segments that show good indicators to be our ideal customer segment. And then double down on these. And try to find more of them. After the strategy session, they found 2 segments that performed better than others.

You can add a link to a resource (of yours) that add value. You can combine this tactic with 4️⃣. 2️⃣ Auto-connect campaigns with ICPs --> Set up a LinkedIn connect campaign. Check tools like lemlist or lagrowthmachine. Import ICPs from Sales navigator to the sequence. It can be a 1-step campaign (only connecting). Or you combine it with tactic 5️⃣ 3️⃣ Revenue-focused posts --> If you want to create pipeline via LinkedIn, focus on content that is highly relevant for (high-intent) ICPs. So start with BOFU content. Talk about pain points, usecases, specific product features, capabilities. Share case studies. I have a full list of content topics you can start with (DM if you want the list) 4️⃣ Engage/reach-out to ICP commenters/likers --> Your content gets traction. Awesome. But don't stop here. Respond to every single comment. Reach out/ connect with people from your ICP. 5️⃣Value-first outreach campaigns --> Connect and DM people from your ICP. You share with them content that (with a high chance) might be relevant for them. No pitch. Just sharing value. If your product/service is relevant for them, they will let you know. 6️⃣ 'Comment-below' lead magnets --> You share highly relevant content on LinkedIn. In order to get the asset, they need to comment & like your post. You get huge organic reach + long list of (ICP) people. They get highly valuable content for free. Then you send a DM (or sequence) with the asset to all commenters. 7️⃣ Turn your profile into your homepage --> A lot of founders have more profile impressions than website traffic. So include the key aspects of a powerful homepage on your profile. I have a full guide on the perfect SaaS homepage. (DM if you want it) 8️⃣ CTAs in your featured section --> Make it easy for people to move forward. This can be a free trial, book a demo or download your lead magnet. 9️⃣ Group of early-supporters --> Have a small group of people who engage with your posts. Ideally, they belong to your ICP. This way LinkedIn will promote your post organically to more people from your ICP. Encourage them to value-comment, not just liking. 👇 What social selling tactic is missing? --- To learn more tactics like this, check out my free GTM newsletter for SaaS founders on their way to 1€ million ARR.",1yr,41,6,2,Yes,image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQGI_e6MQOMERQ/feedshare-shrink_800/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1729241539977?e=1762992000&v=beta&t=Bu1xKAXKxfcATf6h36ufYtAVMrQ27EaxAko0OieX8tc

Better: Build clusters of competitors Let me explain 👇 Most companies have an internal looong list of competitors. But this list is barely used. Because it’s unstructured. So if sales and marketing talks with prospects about the competitive landscape they share a bunch of other direct competitors. Maybe adding some pros and cons of each. Mostly focused on features and price. But this leaves the prospect alone. Alone in doing the hard work to completely understand the different options they have. The different approaches to solve their problem. But that’s hard. So do this INSTEAD. Build competitor clusters. A cluster is a specific approach to solve the problem. Here are a few ways to think about it: 1️⃣Direct competitors —> doing the same as you do —> here you need to be clear on your USP and specific positioning 2️⃣ Indirect competitors —> solving the same problem, but with a different product Here is an example. Let’s say you help companies hire talents faster. And your product is a recruiting software. Then within the direct competition you will have all the other recruiting software tools. And indirect competitors are: - recruiting agencies - freelancers - HR fairs … Differentiating your product from indirect competitors is rather easy. But most struggle to communicate clearly why they are different to other direct competitors. Aka. Your USP/positioning. Build buckets = unique approaches. Some examples: 👉some focus on smooth HR tool integration 👉 some focus on maximum reach with having the most jobplatform integrations 👉others focus on specific roles, eg. Making technical hires easy as they embed technical assignments and AI filtering of unqualified candidates 👉 others leverage AI to write outstanding job description to attract fast best talents 👉 some focus on small/large companies …you get the point. You help the prospect to understand their options. So instead of saying why xyz is bad and you are better. You educate the prospect and say: „If you care about x, then z is the best option for you. And if y is relevant for you, consider p. But if a is important to you, then we are the best option for you“ How do you think about your competition?",1yr,12,2,0,No,,

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7241688136068575232/,"9 actionable tactics to drive pipeline via LinkedIn. For most early-stage SaaS founders LinkedIn is a relevant channel. But very few know how to drive pipeline (aka. generate relevant leads) from LinkedIn. So here are my 9 actionable LinkedIn Selling tactics: 1️⃣ Value-comments on relevant creator's posts --> make a shortlist of 5-15 relevant experts Be one of the first who value comment on their posts. You can add a link to a resource (of yours) that add value. You can combine this tactic with 4️⃣. 2️⃣ Auto-connect campaigns with ICPs --> Set up a LinkedIn connect campaign. Check tools like lemlist or lagrowthmachine. Import ICPs from Sales navigator to the sequence. It can be a 1-step campaign (only connecting). Or you combine it with tactic 5️⃣ 3️⃣ Revenue-focused posts --> If you want to create pipeline via LinkedIn, focus on content that is highly relevant for (high-intent) ICPs. So start with BOFU content. Talk about pain points, usecases, specific product features, capabilities. Share case studies. I have a full list of content topics you can start with (DM if you want the list) 4️⃣ Engage/reach-out to ICP commenters/likers --> Your content gets traction. Awesome. But don't stop here. Respond to every single comment. Reach out/ connect with people from your ICP. 5️⃣Value-first outreach campaigns --> Connect and DM people from your ICP. You share with them content that (with a high chance) might be relevant for them. No pitch. Just sharing value. If your product/service is relevant for them, they will let you know. 6️⃣ 'Comment-below' lead magnets --> You share highly relevant content on LinkedIn. In order to get the asset, they need to comment & like your post. You get huge organic reach + long list of (ICP) people. They get highly valuable content for free. Then you send a DM (or sequence) with the asset to all commenters. 7️⃣ Turn your profile into your homepage --> A lot of founders have more profile impressions than website traffic. So include the key aspects of a powerful homepage on your profile. I have a full guide on the perfect SaaS homepage. (DM if you want it) 8️⃣ CTAs in your featured section --> Make it easy for people to move forward. This can be a free trial, book a demo or download your lead magnet. 9️⃣ Group of early-supporters --> Have a small group of people who engage with your posts. Ideally, they belong to your ICP. This way LinkedIn will promote your post organically to more people from your ICP. Encourage them to value-comment, not just liking. 👇 What social selling tactic is missing? --- To learn more tactics like this, check out my free GTM newsletter for SaaS founders on their way to 1€ million ARR.",1yr,55,8,3,Yes,image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQFULJUiuc1KIg/feedshare-shrink_800/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1726552992697?e=1762992000&v=beta&t=b8Q5kuvRrPnmeG-LWuebussj1c5mDsiIFFI7Hy93cwY

But above all, one of the biggest mistakes we see is: ❌ that we need to figure out where to start with content. “We should talk about our vision”, “Let’s do a series about the key customer pain points” “We need to target these high-volume keywords”.

And it worked well. 500+ people commented. Requesting to get the link. What did this mean for me? ✅ High engagement and validated interest in the content ✅ 5+ new prospects interested in my GTM advisory ✅ 200+ new newsletter subscribers but also ⛔ sending DMs to everyone is limited ⛔ spending 3+ hours commenting on each And here's the thing: LinkedIn limits the amount of DMs you can send daily. And I don't want anyone to wait 2-3 weeks to get the guides. That's why I decided to make this post. Sharing the guides with anyone interested. You will find the link to the guides: 1️⃣ On the first comment of this post 2️⃣ On my LinkedIn profile (featured section) Now I'm asking you. 👉 What GTM guide is missing?,1yr,49,8,2,Yes,image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQEQHjkPlDy2RQ/feedshare-shrink_800/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1724391201048?e=1762992000&v=beta&t=STwCCzZXDn7QymSeQdB6Nk0GItqyfUwq2MJn4jVaP5w

Plan your content programs with the free Content Calendar Template for SaaS 👇 A single post on each stage or topic won’t get you far. Prospects need to repeat the same thing over and over. Across multiple angles and touchpoints. When approaching your first content production, you need to think in terms of series or programs vs. single pieces. What does this mean in practice? 1️⃣ Pick one outcome vertical in your stage of awareness map Select the vertical that is the most painful, urgent, and widely recognized by your prospects or customers. 2️⃣Devise a series of X content pieces Each piece within that outcome vertical at your selected awareness stage. 3️⃣ Building a tight syndication and distribution muscle Share one core piece across multiple placements and/or turn it into multiple micro-pieces syndicated on social. By doing this, you will also build topical authority and brand credibility around your customer outcomes; and position your company and how it can help prospects achieve that outcome. Once you have picked your first content program, you can plan production and distribution across a content calendar.

Why 👇 The problem section should be the 3rd section on your SaaS homepage. It comes right after the: 🔸 Hero section and 🔸 social proof section With this section, you set the context. You connect with the visitor and present them with the ‘shitty’ status quo they are in right now. All before you introduce your product as the right solution. This section mainly has 2 reasons for existing: 1️⃣ Tell the visitors about their ‘shitty’ status quo, so they know they have a problem (that’s worth fixing). 2️⃣ (dis)qualify visitors --> if they do not resonate with this section, there’s a high chance that your product is NOT relevant to them.

It's tempting, because you love your product and what to show them everything. But, a good demo focus on the most important pain points/challenges of your prospect and show them only the features that improve/change this. A sales demo is actually more a meeting. It's not 'purely' screensharing. If this would be a demo, you could replace it with a product video on your website. A demo is not a product training. The goal of a demo is to get them excited/hooked, to invest more time/energy to try the product and see the overall value of it. Don’t make it complex for them to follow. Few things that will improve your demo already by 10x: 1️⃣ Follow a structure: 🔸 Intro & Outlook Make it clear what's the expected outcome of the session + what’s happening the next 45 minutes 🔸Discovery Either a recap of Disco or doing the Discovery. Depends if you follow a 1 or 2 step sales process. If you split Demo & Disco or have it in one meeting. 🔸 'Actual Demo' The part where you show the product. Show feature, tell story, engage, then move on to next feature. Do this 2-4 times. So you keep the focus on the key features and capabilities. 🔸 Summary and next steps Summarize the key aspects (pains & gains).

Here are a few differences I see on LinkedIn (compared to Email): ✅ shorter messages (only 1-2 short sections) —> Make it easy to read on the rather small chat window on LinkedIn ✅ no signature —> That’s why you need a good LinkedIn profile, it’s your signature. ✅ less formatting (no bullet points, empty lines, bold text, etc.) ✅ more informal language (it’s more of a social chat) ✅ it’s okay to use greetings like “Hey (first name)” - instead of (last name) ✅ messages split into multiple smaller messages When it comes to building the actual campaign (the steps and messages), I’ve seen some very good results in ‘splitting’ my beloved TAPSA framework (for Cold Emails) into multiple separate LinkedIn messages.

Here are 3 reasons why. 👇 I believe feature gating is NOT the best strategy for early-stage SaaS I know, the big successful companies all do feature gating in their pricing. They mostly combine 2-3 value metrics and have 3-4 plans. Mostly something along like: - user limits - feature limits (aka feature gating) - product specific metric (e.g. emails, spaces, resources, projects, etc.) While this is obviously awesome, it's also really hard. It's hard to know what are the right limits. And what customer type needs which plan. So I advice early-stage SaaS companies to do value-based pricing on 1 (or max. 2) value metrics - and not feature gating. Here's why.👇 1️⃣ 𝗜𝘁'𝘀 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 --> With every new feature, you need to decide if this is now a premium or basic feature. And also how this affects the overall product experience.

They mostly combine 2-3 value metrics and have 3-4 plans. Mostly something along like: - user limits - feature limits (aka feature gating) - product specific metric (e.g. emails, spaces, resources, projects, etc.) While this is obviously awesome, it's also really hard. It's hard to know what are the right limits. And what customer type needs which plan. So I advise early-stage SaaS companies to do value-based pricing on 1 (or max. 2) value metrics - and not feature gating. Here's why.👇 1️⃣ 𝗜𝘁'𝘀 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 --> With every new feature, you need to decide if this is now a premium or basic feature. And also how this affects the overall product experience.

But direct competitors are... ...mostly not the biggest competition. Most of the time your customers don't take a decision. They stick to the current status quo. They had an overload of information, but did not understand why they should care. So in order to compete against the status quo, make sure that your positioning covers the status quo. What is it that you observe about the status quo, and what is the resulting problem for the customer? What's the problem for the customer? Why should they care? Once they understand that the status quo is not ideal for them, it's time to tell them how you can change the status quo. What's in for them? What's the value for them?
