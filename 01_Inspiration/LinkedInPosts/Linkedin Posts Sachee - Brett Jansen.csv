https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7388600933934546944/,"This is personal, but then again healthcare is personal. Yesterday, I spent 9 hours in the ER at one of Florida's ""best"" hospitals. As someone who's spent 16 years in healthcare technology, what I witnessed wasn't a tech problem but instead a complete operational failure. My view from the hallway (yes, my entire ""room"" for the night): - An 80-year-old car accident victim in a neck brace, crying for hours under fluorescent lights, unable to move while staff walked by - A man getting an abdominal ultrasound for internal bleeding with zero privacy - Me, with complex endometriosis and diverticulosis, experiencing severe pain, unable to breathe deeply, walk, or function Oh, and my face? That was me around 10pm, still haven't been given fluids or anything for pain after 5 hours even though my primary complaint was inability to urinate, lower back pain and unable to take a deep breath. This is the face of disappointment and lost hope. Here were some of the observations that made: - ""Transport people"" shuttling patients between departments for every single test (ultrasound, CT, blood work), then back to our hallway corners - Patient care technicians randomly checking vitals to stay busy - Nurses discussing their ""grossest cases"" within earshot, someone didn't move from their chairs for hours even though I know they had patients in the hallway - Medical supplies scattered everywhere - The ONE person offering blankets? A transport worker—not clinically trained, just human After 7 hours and every test imaginable, a resident appeared to lecture me about birth control (I've had a hysterectomy) and offered 15 minutes of pain relief with morphine. When a butterfly rash formed across my face, they shrugged it off. My husband runs operations. I consult organizations on their growth strategy. We both see waste and inefficiency for a living. But this wasn't resource scarcity. I counted dozens of staff standing around. This was pure operational incompetence. The nurse told me they'd been treating patients in hallways for a year. They've raised concerns. Administration's response? Convert a neighboring department into another ER hallway ""pod"" while building a shiny new outpatient tower. We keep throwing technology at healthcare like it's fairy dust. AI this, digital transformation that. But you can't digitize empathy. You can't automate operational basics. And you sure as hell can't tech your way out of administrators who think hallway medicine is acceptable. I woke up today exhausted, still in pain, inflammation out of control with no answers—just deeper cynicism about a system that would rather build monuments than fix foundations. To every healthcare exec reading this: Before you approve another tech vendor or ribbon-cutting, maybe spend 8 hours in your own ER hallway. Not in scrubs with a badge—as a patient. The transport worker with the blankets understood something your KPIs miss: patients are humans, not throughput metrics.",10h,1336,239,61,Yes,image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQFEmVtBiaJRqQ/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZomVYipIYAg-/0/1761579734167?e=1762992000&v=beta&t=jDQS2T3henGymwqaLy-Xb4NtLw02D-DqNwIFjr4Ydh4
https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7387966857879760896/,"I’ve been open about my battle with stage 4 endometriosis. It’s not glamorous. It’s not “inspiring.” It’s a daily negotiation with pain. Lately, that pain has expanded beyond my pelvic region. Thoracic endo now presses against my diaphragm and lungs—tightness, stabbing pain in my right shoulder, shortness of breath so bad it hurts to breathe deeply. Add arthritis-like pain, chronic fatigue, recurring bladder infections, night sweats, and nausea that feels like food poisoning on repeat. Yesterday, I woke up with one of the worst flare-ups I’ve had. Normally, I manage with 100mg of tramadol, heat pads, broth, and water. But this time felt different. It hurt to stand. It hurt to sit. My body waved a white flag. I pushed through client calls, then slept 12 hours. Woke up worse—barely able to get out of bed without help. The traditional route (which I’ve taken more times than I can count) would have been the ER. Instead, I turned to my concierge primary care provider, Rachel Shelley Dhani, MD CAQSM —the person I now pay out of pocket because I got tired of being another chart number. I sent her my full medical history, labs, and imaging—all the data that’s been passed between specialists for years. Here’s what she found: My MRI from a month ago shows a severe case of diverticulosis. It’s been sitting there, unaddressed. Missed by every OB, GI, rheumatologist, and thoracic surgeon who has “reviewed” my file. Not one caught it. Not one mentioned it. Because each was only looking for their thing. This is the failure of our healthcare system in one patient story. A system built on specialization over integration, transaction over investigation, documentation over discernment. Now, my new care plan actually involves collaboration—distinguishing what belongs to endo vs. diverticulosis, harmonizing treatments, and building a lifestyle plan that treats me, not just my conditions. That’s what care should look like. It shouldn’t take privilege, persistence, or concierge care to get it. And this is why millions voted for the promise of MAHA—Make America Healthy Again. Not because we believe in quacks. Not because we reject vaccines or science. But because we’re exhausted. Exhausted by a system that’s reactive, fragmented, and obsessed with billing codes over human outcomes. If we want to fix healthcare, it has to start with philosophy first. Then policy and incentives. Then—and only then—comes the technology. Right now, we keep slapping “tech-enabled” and “AI-powered” on processes that are fundamentally broken. All we’re doing is automating dysfunction. This is why I keep working in healthcare. Because the system doesn’t need another app. It needs a new operating model. And yes—I’ll be fine. God wouldn’t hand me pain I couldn’t handle. I don’t let a little pain get in the way of the impact I plan to make—in this world, or in healthcare.",2d,53,7,1,No,,

Yes, I know posts formatted like this look “AI-generated.” But LinkedIn ’s algorithm doesn’t care about your aesthetic preferences—it cares about readability. Short lines. White space. Rhythm. If you want your content to carry, this is the price. And to the faceless accounts (mostly older men, for some reason) who keep messaging to tell me my writing is “awful” or “the writing of a 7yo,"" Scroll on. DM harassment over syntax is… not the power move you think it is. (Yes, I have no issue sharing screen shots of those that are currently harassing me in the DMs, many of them CEOs nonetheless). Now, onto.... HLTH Inc. The show was glossy, loud, ambitious. But if we’re being honest, it’s having an identity crisis. Who is this conference really for? Investors? Founders chasing Series B? Enterprise vendors? When you try to serve everyone, you serve no one particularly well. AI was everywhere—on booths, on badges, on every other tagline. But the messaging? Generic, soulless, clearly AI-written with zero human edit. We’re leaning so hard into artificial intelligence that we’re losing authentic intelligence. The sessions I did attend were fantastic. Thoughtful, current, well-moderated. The real shame? Half-empty rooms. It felt like people came to deal, not to learn. But the overwhelming sentiment was that deal's were not happening during the day, but at private events at night. One major highlight: the Women’s Startup Pitch. Substance over buzzwords. Founders, pitching for 5 minutes to investors ""shark tank"" style. Talk about pressure. Founders from Veera Health , Incora Health , and Maman Biomedical bringing actual innovation, not vaporware. Let's elevate them more, not in a small room, towards the end of the day, focused on women only. We don't need our own room, we just want a seat at the main table... aka THE MAIN STAGE. Now, the logistics: Healthy eating is fine in theory, but by 4pm, coast-to-coast travelers needed something heartier than quinoa. Fed people are engaged people. Hangry people are not. (Shoutout to the CHIME booth for the Coke Zero mercy rescue and the great discussion on how I can ensure my clients are plugged into the CHIME ecosystem). HLTH used to feel like rebellion—the new kid breaking rules. This year, it felt like it was trying to re-create that energy instead of re-inventing it. Still, I want to acknowledge the HLTH team. Running an event of this scale is brutal, and the production value was exceptional. My critique isn’t about effort, it’s about evolution. The market’s ripe for something new. Until then, I’ll keep coming back. Because despite the noise, HLTH still draws the sharpest minds, boldest founders, and some of my favorite people in healthcare. My favorite interactions?

Fully expecting to be roasted on this by Matthew Holt . Bring it, friend 😎 I don’t want anyone turned away from care. But socialized medicine isn’t the answer. Access, affordability, and quality are three different problems that get lumped together under “Medicare for All.” It’s intellectually lazy and ignores how the system actually works. When the ACA passed, we pooled the sick and the healthy. It gave access, yes - but made premiums skyrocket for the healthier population. We pretended it wouldn’t. It did. The deception ran deeper. Meaningful Use promised interoperability and connected records. Instead, we’re still faxing. And “if you like your plan, you can keep it”? Also a lie. Let’s say it out loud: the ACA was one of the worst policies ever forced through. Not because expanding access is wrong - but because execution ignored basic economics, enriched middlemen, and created more problems than it solved. Pharma lobbies Washington for profit. Full stop. PBMs drive up drug prices under “admin overhead.” Eliminate them. Point blank, period. Payers shouldn't be dictating care with their Big Brother prior authorization process that is corrupt, unethical, and completely out of control. Physicians are spending hours fighting 97-year-old podiatrists reviewing cardiac procedures. It's not about care—it's about keeping premiums longer to earn time value of money. Physicians need the opportunity to run hospitals again. Remember Physician Hospital Organizations (PHOs)? We need that model back—where clinical expertise drives operations, not MBA administrators optimizing for quarterly earnings. We need representatives who actually know healthcare - not politicians parroting lobbyists. We need to stop pushing for systems from countries one-tenth our size. (Bernie and AOC). And we need to face the truth which is our lifestyle crisis is a healthcare crisis. You can’t innovate your way out of a Big Mac. I believe in a market-driven system that doesn’t leave people to die in the streets. Those aren’t opposing views. That requires: 1️⃣ Pricing transparency (Cost Plus Drugs is showing the way) 2️⃣ Real competition without middlemen 3️⃣ Clinical and AI governance by providers 4️⃣ Personal responsibility and more consumer education for preventable disease 5️⃣ Policy expertise over partisan noise Our system isn’t capitalism. It’s crony capitalism - where incumbents write rules, lobbyists write laws, and patients pay the bill. True free-market healthcare would terrify every PBM, payer, and pharma exec in the room. Which is exactly why we should pursue it. This is also exactly why they won't let it happen.",1w,59,17,4,No,,

HLTH Inc. is where health tech comes to see and be seen—by peers, investors, and potential acquirers. It's LinkedIn made physical. And there's nothing wrong with that, as long as we're honest about it. But Sunday's opening sessions exposed the fundamental contradictions healthcare continues to ignore. 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐦𝐚-𝐭𝐨-𝐏𝐁𝐌 𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐡 The day opened with pharma's impassioned plea led by Eli Lilly and Company and Rob Lowe (why? nobody knows): we need more people in clinical trials. Only 7% of cancer patients participate, creating massive bottlenecks in bringing life-saving medications to market. Valid. Important. Necessary. Then we immediately pivoted to Mark Cuban systematically eviscerating the entire pharmaceutical supply chain—demolishing the economic model that forces patients on ACA Silver plans to pay $606/month for seven months straight for a drug that costs manufacturers $200 after rebates. The cognitive dissonance was deafening. In one breath, we're asking patients to trust pharma enough to join clinical trials. In the next, we're acknowledging the industry's pricing mechanisms are designed to extract maximum value from those same patients. 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐛𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐭 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 Mark Cuban is doing important work with Cost Plus Drugs. His transparency model is forcing overdue conversations. But out of every brilliant healthcare operator who lives in the trenches of this industry every single day, HLTH brought on a Gen Z podcaster (not healthcare related)—by his own admission—was studying terminology the night before. Healthcare conferences increasingly platform celebrity voices over subject matter experts. We prize buzz over insight. 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐈'𝐦 𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐅𝐨𝐫 Despite my cynicism (or maybe because of it), I'm energized: ✅ The AI Sessions: Even though navigating between overlapping sessions in heels is its own cardio workout. ✅ The Conversations: Reconnecting with operators who understand the difference between a buyer persona and an actual buyer. ✅ GTM Strategy: Talking with organizations about their 2026 roadmap. The founders ready to stop guessing and start executing. ✅ Launching Something New (tomorrow): A program for executives who want to master AI in their workflow before mandating company-wide initiatives. HLTH Inc. reflects where healthcare wants to be: innovative, patient-centered, transparent. Sunday's programming revealed where we are: platforming celebrity over expertise, prioritizing optics over outcomes, asking patients to trust systems we openly acknowledge are broken. Are we building innovation for the system we have, or the system we wish existed? Because right now, we're trying to do both.

Here's the truth: AI doesn't fix your GTM. It amplifies it. If your GTM engine has friction, AI just helps you fail faster. The real bottlenecks aren't in your tech stack. They're in your handoffs. Map your full GTM flow: → Awareness → Interest (Marketing) → Interest → Engagement (SDR/BDR) → Engagement → Qualified Opp (AE) → Opp → Closed-Won (Sales + SE) → Customer → Activated (CS) At each transition, ask: 1. Where do prospects drop off? 2. Where does context get lost? 3. Where do teams duplicate work? 4. Where do decisions slow down? The fix: AI-generated handoff brief (auto-created from SDR calls, enriched with market intel, one-pager to the AE). Before you add another AI tool, fix the friction points first.

Most teams have 5-10 of these hiding in plain sight. The problem isn't that you need more AI tools. It's that you haven't found the real inefficiencies yet. Here's what works: Map your 3 most critical workflows (the messy reality, not the idealized version) Ask: Where do handoffs break? Where does context get lost? What requires ""tribal knowledge""?

This is the dumbest thing health tech startups do. I've seen companies obsess over optimizing their sales funnel—every email sequence, every demo conversion rate, every objection handler—while completely ignoring the expansion motion sitting inside their existing accounts.

Damage control (keep them from churning) Support escalation (fix problems) Relationship maintenance (check-in calls) What CS should actually be: Your highest-ROI sales channel.

Comp CS on net revenue retention, not just renewal rates. Train CS reps to identify and qualify expansion signals. Give CS the authority to propose scope changes without ""looping in sales."" Build expansion playbooks based on usage milestones and buyer maturity. Real example: A remote patient monitoring company I worked with was stuck at $7M ARR with a 12-month sales cycle. We restructured CS to own expansion. Gave them quotas. Trained them to spot buying signals. Built trigger-based outreach sequences. Within 6 months, 40% of new revenue came from existing accounts.

One app. All healthcare services. Every specialty. Every access point. Consolidated. He told me it would ""shut down all the startups."" When I started the engagement, his Series A company had 14 customers. And 14 completely different use cases. But Chad was convinced he was building the future of healthcare. Here's the problem: Amazon works because buying paper towels, books, and electronics all require the same behavior: browse, click, buy, ship. Healthcare doesn't work that way. Booking a primary care visit is nothing like coordinating specialty care. Which is nothing like managing chronic disease. Which is nothing like urgent care access. Different buyers. Different workflows. Different pain points. Different decision processes. Chad told himself three lies: Lie #1: ""We can serve everyone in healthcare"" His ""horizontal platform"" meant it was for everyone. Except his 14 customers were using it 14 different ways. A 50-bed rural hospital using it for telemedicine. A 15-physician group using it for referral management. An employer using it for navigation. When I told him we needed to pick ONE, he said I ""didn't understand the vision and clearly didn't understand how healthcare works."" Lie #2: ""Our customers all have the same pain point"" They didn't. One bought it for virtual care access. One for care coordination. One for price transparency. One because they had a grant to spend. Real product-market fit is when 10 similar buyers buy for the SAME reason, implement the SAME way, and get the SAME outcome. Chad couldn't articulate that. But he could yell at anyone who asked him to. Lie #3: ""We'll figure out our ICP once we have more customers"" I told Chad: every unfocused customer makes your next sale harder. Your sales team can't build a playbook. Your marketing can't speak to anyone. Your roadmap becomes Frankenstein. Pick ONE customer type. Get 20 wins. Then expand. He told me I was ""thinking too small"" and ""didn't understand platform businesses."" Two weeks later, he fired his VP of Sales for missing quota. I terminated the engagement immediately after. Chad thought he was Bezos. Last I heard, Chad's on his fourth VP of Sales in 18 months. Still has 14 customers. Still convinced he's building Amazon. You don't need a bigger vision.

But they're 6 months from retirement and won't champion anything that creates work for their team. - The Innovation Director is your internal cheerleader. But they have zero buying authority and don't realize it. The best health tech sales reps I know aren't just good at discovery. They're good at power mapping. They ask: 1️⃣ Who actually controls budget allocation? 2️⃣ Who has the CEO's ear? 3️⃣ What political capital will my champion burn by pushing this forward? 4️⃣ Who secretly wants this project to fail, and why? 5️⃣ What org politics am I walking into that have nothing to do with my product? You can't logic someone out of a position they didn't logic themselves into. Sometimes the ""objection"" you're hearing has nothing to do with your product. It's about internal turf wars, legacy vendor relationships, or someone's bonus structure. The founders who master this don't just build better products. They build better stakeholder maps. They understand influence networks. They know when to go around, when to go above, and when to walk away. Healthcare GTM isn't a chess game.

For months, I’d been looking for more creative ways to share content with prospects and clients. Let’s be honest - sending a PowerPoint or PDF isn’t exactly lighting anyone up these days. Last year, a client had success using Ceros to build custom landing pages. It worked, but I wanted something that could go further - something that told a story, not just displayed one. That’s when I found Foleon. Here’s why I was blown away: They actually listened. Their discovery process wasn’t a pitch - it was a conversation (thanks to Makki Goodbee II ). They spent the majority of the call asking smart questions about the organization, the problem, and the outcome we were aiming for. They showed, not told. As a follow-up, they built a custom, on-brand mini-website that I could use internally to secure executive approval. I’ve always said: if your internal champion can’t sell your solution inside their org, the deal is dead. Foleon made it easy for me to sell the vision. And when we hit the final stretch, their team - shout-out to Barbara Desmyter and their CRO, Ceasar Chevalier - jumped on a call immediately. We had an urgent turnaround, and they went above and beyond to fast-track a design team and project manager so we could meet our deadline. Today, that project is already in motion - and the client is thrilled. Lessons learned: 1. Give more than you take when a deal is on the line. 2. Customize your proposals so buyers feel seen, not sold. 3. Delight customers after the signature. 4. Show value immediately so they become your biggest advocates. This isn’t complicated.

Map Your Bottlenecks First Where are deals actually dying? (Hint: It's probably not where you think) One RevOps leader I worked with thought it was SDR response time. It was actually contract redlines taking 3 weeks. 2. Automate The Constraint, Not The Noise Don't automate every step. Automate the step that's blocking everything else. → The constraint is your leverage point 3. ""Human In The Loop"" Checkpoints AI should accelerate decisions, not make them unsupervised. (at least, not yet). Build validation gates at every handoff. Especially where money or reputation is at risk. 4. Redesign Your SLAs Your current SLAs were built for manual processes. If AI can cut response time from 24 hours to 2 hours, your SLA should reflect that. Or your competitors' will.

The bottleneck?

And the kicker? Not a peep from title once everything was signed. This isn’t my first real estate transaction. My husband and I have bought five homes in the last seven years (primary + rentals), and every single transaction has been slowed down by the same choke points: 1. Zero communication. 2. Tools like DocuSign and email exist, but title companies don’t use them effectively. 3. No customer service or sense of urgency.

My question to founders is: “Why did you hire a VP of Sales and then cut them off from owning strategic accounts?” This control-driven approach kills sales teams faster than bad leads or impossible quotas. Tagging accounts as “strategic” and then blocking reps from pursuing them sends one message: we don’t trust you to do the job we hired you for. The ego + fear version: “I built this relationship personally,“ or ""These deals are too important.” Translation: You’re still stuck in founder-led sales mode and need coaching on how to lead your teams better. The greedy version: “They don't deserve to make that big of a commission, we really should adjust our comp plans.” Translation: Control matters more than growth and you don't understand the end to end level of effort to get a health tech sales deal across the finish line. The best reps won’t stay on a bench. They didn’t join to chase warm leads and mid-tier accounts—they came to hunt, solve complex problems, and earn commissions that match. If you block them from big-game deals, they’ll move to a company that doesn’t. If your “strategic” accounts only close when you personally step in, your GTM isn’t built to scale. You’ve created a process dependent on you—not a repeatable system your team can run. Healthcare sales requires relationship depth, technical credibility, and institutional knowledge. Train your reps to develop those muscles instead of hoarding the very accounts that would force them to grow. Protecting deals doesn’t build a business. Building a team that can win them consistently does. I repeat.......Scale means letting go. Revenue predictability comes from process, not protection. Your strategic accounts should be proof that your sales team works—not proof that you’re afraid to pay them.",2mo,48,9,0,No,,

I sat at his bedside while they assessed him. I filled out intake paperwork on an iPad. The doctor explained exactly what they were doing and why. They ran a FAST exam on the spot. Fifteen minutes later, a nurse brought me a complete care plan—line-by-line diagnostics, medications, procedures—with the price for each, in black and white. “Here’s what we recommend. Do you want to move forward with all of it? Or start with certain tests first?” I said yes to all. I knew exactly what I was agreeing to. I knew what it would cost. I knew why each item was necessary. And it was my choice. (Turns out he has pancreatitis likely caused by his food The Farmer's Dog ). Im not tagging the company to throw them under the bus, but more to raise awareness that this type of food has a high fat content, and in rare instances, cause pancreatitis.

Someone orders tests you don’t understand, for reasons no one explains. No one tells you what they cost. Your insurance company will decide later if they were “necessary” enough to cover. Weeks later, you get a bill. Or rather—a stack of them, from multiple providers. Each one a surprise. No one asks if you wanted to start with one test over another.

The white house isn't just supporting AI adoption, they are actively removing barriers. Regulatory sandboxes at FDA and SEC mean faster validation paths.

For startup founders, this isn't just policy, this can help write your playbook.

If you're still pitching ""automation"" to clinicians, you're swimming upstream against federal messaging. 2️⃣ Lead with transparency and evaluation With new AI testbeds and evaluation frameworks coming, ""trust"" isn't a nice-to-have anymore. It's table stakes. Open-weight models get preference, and your ability to explain your AI will differentiate you. 3️⃣ Position for the infrastructure buildout The plan commits to domain-specific AI adoption efforts in healthcare.

Yet most sales enablement treats them like they're all reading from the same playbook. Here's what sophisticated healthcare sales enablement actually looks like: ➡️ You map every stakeholder's decision criteria—not just their title. ➡️ You create content that speaks to the night-shift nurse AND the procurement director. ➡️ You build parallel engagement paths because healthcare decisions aren't linear; they're multi-dimensional. The companies winning deals in 2025 aren't the ones with the flashiest AI claims.

Last month, I was brought in to optimize a health tech company’s funnel. But it wasn’t the funnel that needed fixing.... It was the fact that Marketing and Sales weren’t even on the same page. The VP of marketing was frustrated: 🗣️ “We delivered 200+ MQLs last quarter. Sales isn't working them and won't report on the outcomes?” The VP of Sales shot back: 🗣️ “You are counting anyone that downloaded our white paper a lead. These aren’t buyers. We don't even know how they got to our website?"" And RevOps? Silent. No definitions. No alignment. No shared accountability. The core issue? Marketing was only playing at the top of the funnel, with zero visibility into what happened post-demo. They did not have a pov on the customer buying journey but just knew any person that took the time to download the white paper must be interested in a conversation. They celebrated volume because they didn’t know what actually converted. Sales couldn’t define ‘qualified,' when I really pinned them down on it. The VP told me marketing should be creating pipeline, his team should be working to close deals. Because hey—cold calling is dead, right? (Except it’s not. But their SDR function was.) What changed? We got every GTM leader in one room (well a zoom call). I presented my findings after a 2 week audit with the team and had what I call a ""get your life right moment"" with the leadership. We collectively aligned on what “qualified” actually means—based on real closed-won behavior. We started building content that supports the entire funnel—especially the messy middle where most deals go to die. And Sales? They’re rebuilding their outbound muscle now, instead of treating Marketing like a lead vending machine. Is it perfect yet? Not even close. But my client has already seen: ✔️ Fewer circular meetings about lead quality (I call that swirl) ✔️ A marketing team producing content that helps after the demo ✔️ A sales team that’s finally owning part of the pipeline equation The biggest lesson for my client and future clients: If your GTM feels off, stop blaming execution.

No stakeholder-specific assets. Not even an implementation timeline. Calls 21–40: “We can’t compete on price.” Their positioning was feature-focused. No outcomes, no differentiation. Price was all they had left. Calls 41–50: “We need better marketing.” What they had was vague, interchangeable content. Nothing that spoke directly to their buyer or their market.

Later, I cheered in the NFL for four years. From the outside? Discipline, fitness, commitment. Excellence. On the inside? Body dysmorphia, burnout, and a toxic relationship with food, rest, and worth. The truth is in my early 20s, I was climbing up the corporate ladder, finishing grad school and cheering for the NFL - all at once. I lived on celery, shredded chicken, adderal and Red Bull 😐 I wish I were joking. Spent hours on the stair master in sweats and then another 30 mins in the sauna. And justified to myself that I was “dedicated” This year, I made a commitment to break that cycle. To rebuild—not just my body—but my mindset, energy, and connection with the people I love. Be the best version of myself. For real this time. Here are 20 lessons I’ve learned that actually made a difference: 🔹 Eat the fruit. Seriously. 🔹 Natural sugar isn’t the enemy. 🔹 When your hormones are in check, intimacy and connection come naturally. 🔹 We often eat from boredom, thirst, or stress—not hunger. 🔹 Movement is medicine. 🔹 A high-protein diet keeps you full and helps you recover. 🔹 Eggs are good for your brain. 🔹 Walking 10k+ steps a day is free therapy. 🔹 Epigenetics > “bad genetics.” 🔹 Master the basics. You don’t need “muscle confusion.” 🔹 Your self-talk shapes your actions. 🔹 Balance > restriction. 🔹 If you struggle with consistency, move early in the day. 🔹 3–4 strong workouts > 7 half-hearted ones. 🔹 Dehydration messes with your focus and mood. 🔹 Don’t compromise on sleep. 🔹 Sleep impacts cravings. 🔹 Get sunlight in the morning or when you need a break 🔹 Cold showers can help break a spiral. 🔹 You don’t need motivation—you need systems. This isn’t about chasing aesthetics anymore. It’s about energy. Peace. Presence.

Here’s the problem I kept seeing: Revenue gaps didn’t come from lazy teams or a missing feature. They came from “systems problems” - where everyone was busy, but no one truly owned the outcome. I used to think more activity meant better results. But all the calls, demos, and Slack threads didn’t add up. Pipeline kept looking full, but deals stalled. Sound familiar? The fix was simple but I received pushback: Every key revenue outcome gets ONE clear owner. No more “shared accountability.” No more “team effort” hiding the gaps. Here’s how I apply radical responsibility mapping now: • Map the full customer journey → Every handoff, every touchpoint, every moment that matters • Assign ONE owner per outcome → Not “sales + marketing,” not “growth team”-a name, not a department • Kill the pipeline mirage → Only count deals with confirmed intent, not “maybes” or wishful thinking • Track outcomes, not activity → Did the revenue happen? Who made it happen? If not, why? • Use AI for speed, not shortcuts → Automate the grunt work, but keep human eyes on what actually moves the needle When you do this, excuses vanish.

Campaigns ≠ Content A campaign is a coordinated push toward one measurable outcome. Content is the fuel that powers every stage of that push. Most teams mix the two—then wonder why their funnel stalls. How to Shift from Campaign-Chasing to Asset-Building 👇🏼 1. Start with the metric, not the megaphone. Define the exact shift you need: +20 demo requests −10 days in sales cycle 15% lift in expansion ARR. 2. Design an asset stack, not a one-off. Think pillar content (deep insight) that generates proof points (case snippets) and prompts (micro-CTAs). One pillar can fuel a month of reusable content, each mapped to a funnel stage. 3. Build once, circulate always. Store assets in a library tagged by ICP, pain point, and objection. No more ""Do we have a PDF for that?"" Slack chaos. 4. Measure utility, not just views. Track what moves revenue: reply rates meeting conversions, deal velocity. If it doesn't move a needle, iterate or kill it. Can you tie every piece of content to a pipeline KPI? Does your calendar label assets by funnel stage—not just publish date? Can your SDRs find the right proof point in under 60 seconds? If not, you're throwing confetti—not driving growth.

In its “Make America Healthy Again” blueprint, the CMS Innovation Center lays out three non-negotiables for every Medicare dollar: 1️⃣ Evidence-based prevention 2️⃣ Patient empowerment through data & choice 3️⃣ Real competition that rewards outcomes, not volume Yet too many health-tech founders are still playing the SaaS “solve one pain point” game. In healthcare, that’s a good way to get laughed out of the room (or quietly cut from the RFP list). Translation: build right, or get shut out. Where most startups stall: 🔴 VBC buyers evaluate impact across clinical, financial and IT layers. If your tool doesn’t move the HEDIS/Star/TCO needle and slot into existing pipes, you’re noise. Clinical, finance and IT all vote. Miss one stakeholder, lose the deal. 🔴 “We’ll figure out compliance later.” Prevention incentives, patient-level data sharing, downside risk—all baked into CMS’s new models. If you plan to “tackle compliance later,” enjoy the 18-month delay. 🔴 Data blind spots. Most health systems still run on duct-taped EHR feeds. Your AI/analytics tool is only as good as the garbage flowing in. Build for FHIR and duct-tape HL7 on day one—or expect integration purgatory. You can't just pivot to VBC when the market demands it. The buying cycles are 12-18+ months. The integration requirements are complex. The compliance standards are non-negotiable. What the winners are doing right now: ✅ Mapping their product value to VBC metrics—showing hard ROI on prevention, empowerment, and competitive choice. ✅ Building for interoperability from day one (FHIR, HL7, payer integration) ✅ Understanding the stakeholder matrix (who influences, who decides, who pays) ✅ Designing for population health outcomes, not just individual patient care By 2026, early VBC adopters will flaunt case studies everyone else will need just to stay in the conversation. By 2030, aligning to CMS’s pillars won’t be strategy—it’ll be table stakes. Does your GTM actually align with the VBC gauntlet your buyers are racing through?

The stakes couldn’t be higher.

I’ve seen this mistake cost companies years. I’ve helped them recover—if they survived. Growth In Market (GIM) is a different game. Now you have traction. The challenge is multiplying it—without breaking what made you special. What matters at this stage: ▶️ Relentlessly removing friction from every buyer touchpoint ▶️ Personalizing at scale, not just automating ▶️ Unlocking revenue expansion within your existing base ▶️ Staying hyper-attuned to shifts in buyer behavior and market signals Unfortunately, early success breeds complacency.

A client shared this with me on Friday, and it's a perfect example of the pattern that separates businesses that thrive from those that dive. She's standing at a moment of truth - that inflection point where fear and excitement collide. Her business is exploding with opportunity, but she's carrying the scars from her last company where she learned one of the most expensive lessons in business. In her prior role as a CRO, she destroyed her sales targets - 180% of goal. Leadership was celebrating, investors were smiling, everyone thought they'd cracked the code. But they'd built their success on a foundation of sand. Because while sales was winning, operations was failing. Spectacularly. They had a healthcare product that worked beautifully in sandbox environments. They'd even ""turned it on"" with a handful of beta clients and gotten results. But - and this is crucial - those beta clients were part of the development process. They were invested partners who would work through bugs, tolerate workarounds, and help troubleshoot when things went sideways. The fatal mistake? Leadership confused beta success with market readiness. When real paying customers started onboarding, the clinical workflows that looked smooth in sandbox became a nightmare. These weren't forgiving beta partners - these were healthcare organizations that expected seamless integration from day one. No patience for bugs. No tolerance for ""we'll fix that next week."" The result? Angry clients, terminated contracts, clawbacks that wiped out months of commissions for her and her team. Team morale plummeted. The CEO started lashing out. People started quitting before the board said ""it's time to cut 15% of the workforce."" She watched her financial future get ripped away because leadership made the ultimate strategic error: they confused proof of concept with scalable operations. This is the pattern that's killing businesses across America, especially in healthtech. I'm not here to shame leaders - I'm here to shatter the illusion that beta success equals market readiness. The truth? There are well-known startups in healthtech that made this exact mistake last year. They scaled sales without scaling operations beyond beta. Today, they're staring at 4-6 months of cash runway, fighting for survival. Here's what 74% of high-growth startups refuse to understand: Beta clients will forgive you. Paying customers will fire you. Success leaves clues, and so does failure. My client gets it now. She's building with intention, ensuring every workflow is bulletproof before the first sale. The question isn't whether you'll face this challenge - it's whether you'll learn from others' pain or create your own. What's your strategy for moving from beta success to market-ready operations?

If your founding team is heavy on engineering and light on lived experience inside hospitals, clinics, or payer orgs… you're building something that works in demos but dies in deployment. 90% of health tech startups fail not because their technology is bad, but because they never understood the problem they were solving. Too many teams fall into the same trap: ✅ Brilliant engineers ✅ Polished UI ❌ Zero clinical validation ❌ No strategy for 12-18 month buying cycles ❌ Missing clarity about the workflows or politics they're disrupting ❌ Misunderstanding about who their ICP actually is That last one kills deals before they start. You think you're selling to the CMIO, but the CFO holds the budget. You think the department head is your champion, but the frontline staff can torpedo implementation. You focus on the buyer while ignoring the end users who actually determine adoption. Here's what changes everything: 1️⃣ Clinical insight isn't optional - it's foundational. When clinicians are embedded early, you don't just build features. You build workflows that enhance care instead of creating more clicks. You catch the workflow breaks that engineers miss and uncover needs that only surface at 2 AM in the ICU. 2️⃣ GTM strategy can't be an afterthought. Healthcare buying isn't B2B - it's B2B2B2B. Your ""user"" (the nurse) isn't your buyer (IT director) isn't your budget holder (CFO) isn't your champion (CMO). Each has different pain points, decision criteria, and veto power. Map every stakeholder from day one. Identify who can say yes, who can say no, and who influences both. Build parallel relationships. That meeting coordinator you're ignoring? They might be your champion's most trusted advisor. 3️⃣ The winning formula: Clinical expertise shapes what you build. Technical excellence makes it scalable. GTM mastery gets it adopted. You can't afford to be great at just one. Healthcare demands all three working in lockstep. hashtag # HealthTech hashtag # GTMStrategy hashtag # ClinicalInsight hashtag # DigitalHealth hashtag # Founders",4mo,52,11,0,No,,

A “stealth” startup posted a Chief Revenue Officer role with a laundry list of responsibilities - owning all sales and marketing, building the GTM strategy from scratch, launching commercialization, driving the company to $1M/month in recurring revenue within 18 months, and prepping for acquisition. Comp? Equity: 5% founder shares. Salary: $75–95k. But only after commercialization. In two months. 🤡 This isn’t a job. This is exploitation dressed up as “opportunity.” There are incredibly talented people out there right now - hungry, qualified, and undervalued. But this role isn’t it. This is the kind of offer that preys on desperation and bets on someone not knowing their worth. Funny enough, I recently spoke with a CEO who carried the same mindset. Arrogant, dismissive, and out of touch with what it takes to attract top talent. Within five minutes of our discovery call, I told him it wasn’t going to be a fit.

Not because I don’t believe in your mission - but because how equity translates to real value isn't always clear Here’s the TL;DR math (simplified on purpose): Let’s say you offer me: • 1% equity in your Series A startup • Current valuation: $10M On paper, that’s worth ~$100K today. Sounds great, right? But here’s the reality: 1️⃣ You probably won’t exit at $1B 2️⃣ You will dilute in future rounds (my 1% becomes ~0.75%) 3️⃣ I’m taking 100% of the risk, with no salary in hand 4️⃣ That “equity payday” could be 7-10 years out — if it happens 5️⃣ I’ll owe taxes when/if I exercise, and there’s no liquidity until you exit Even if you do exit at $1B, and I do make $7M+... I’ve traded years of work with no cash flow, no guarantees, and no upside protection. That’s not a smart deal. That’s a lottery ticket. If you believe in your company enough to offer equity, back it up with a cash component - even if it’s modest. It shows respect for my time and alignment with your commitment. 🚨 And if you’re a consultant reading this? 🚨 Equity can be sweet - in addition to a fair rate. But don’t pay your bills with hypothetical exits. Ask yourself: if this company fails way after your engagement is over, would you be proud of the work and feel compensated fairly for it?

Here's what many first-time health tech founders get wrong when raising capital: 1️⃣ You didn’t research the fund. VCs aren't saying no because they don’t believe in innovation. They’re saying no because your company doesn’t match their thesis. Each fund has a focus: stage, geography, check size, sector (hint: ""healthcare"" can mean payers, providers, life sciences, digital health, or all of the above). Before you pitch, read what they’ve written. Study who they’ve funded. If there’s no match; don’t force one. 2️⃣ You pitched an associate, not a decision-maker. Unless you’re being championed internally by a partner, your deal isn't moving forward. Partners make investment decisions. Everyone else filters. Be respectful of the process, but know who has power in the room. 3️⃣ You treated it like a transaction, not a relationship. VCs are placing a bet on you, not just your product. They're risking their reputation, passing on your competitors, and committing years to support you. If they can’t see themselves in your corner through the FDA cycles, hospital procurement delays, and policy shifts - it's a pass. 4️⃣ You didn’t de-risk the bet. Healthcare is already hard. If you’re: • not full-time • missing clinical or technical expertise • unclear on reimbursement or go-to-market • unable to articulate regulatory or policy risks You’re asking them to take on all the uncertainty. That’s not a good trade. 5️⃣ You’re not building a VC-backable business. VCs look for scale. Not just a great product or a few reference sites. They need to believe your model can grow 7x-10x and return the fund. Not every healthcare business needs VC capital - and that’s okay. 6️⃣ You’re not making them believe. Winning founders are ambitious, coachable, and magnetic. They show up with a clear vision, a repeatable model, and the ability to attract talent, customers, and capital. Healthcare is personal, complex, and political. If you don’t have the conviction to lead a movement, VCs will sense that. This isn’t about chasing validation. It’s about understanding how the capital markets work so you can play the game strategically, not emotionally.

All you need is a clear, repeatable framework. Here’s a 5-step prompt you can use today (that I have used previously to ghost write content for startups) to draft engaging, SEO-focused long-form blogs or articles: 1️⃣ Set Your Topic & Keywords “Write a well-crafted, informative article on ‘[YOUR TOPIC]’ that’s optimized for SEO. Integrate the primary keyword ‘[PRIMARY KEYWORD]’ naturally throughout, plus these related terms: ‘[RELATED KEYWORDS]’.” Pro Tip: Use free tools like AnswerThePublic or Google’s “People also ask” to discover related long-tail keywords. 2️⃣ Hook ‘Em with Your Introduction “Start with a captivating introduction that: • Hooks readers in the first 2–3 lines • States why this topic matters now • Teases a real-world example or stat” Example: “Did you know 70% of buyers start their journey with an online search? If your blog doesn’t show up on page one, you might as well not exist.” 3️⃣ Build a Structured, Value-Packed Body “Organize your article into clear headings and subheadings. Under each: • Offer practical insights or step-by-step guidance • Cite examples, data, or third-party sources to back up claims • Include a mini-case study or anecdote where possible” Structure Sample: - What SEO-Focused Content Really Means - How to Research & Select Keywords - Writing Tips for Readability & Engagement - Promoting Your Post to Drive Traffic 4️⃣ Wrap It Up with a Strong Conclusion “Finish by summarizing the key takeaways and offering actionable next steps, for example: • A checklist of 3 things to do after publishing • Tools or templates to speed up your process • A call to action to download a free PDF or leave a comment” 5️⃣ Keep It Conversational & Share-Friendly “Write in a human tone - use ‘you’ and ‘we’ - and mix in bullet lists, bold text, and examples to break up walls of copy. and Remove ALL EM DASHES"" 💡 Why This Works: You’ve given yourself a blueprint, no blank-page anxiety.

I was raised by a single mom who taught me to own my outcomes. Be the victor, not the victim. That mindset shaped how I lead. I don’t sugarcoat, I don’t play politics, and I don’t leave people guessing. I give direct, in-the-moment feedback because I believe in giving people a fair shot to grow, improve, and win. My teams know exactly where they stand, because clarity is a form of respect. Over the past few years, words like “triggered” and “gaslit” have exploded in popularity. And while they started as important ways to name harmful behaviors, I worry they’ve been overused to the point of losing meaning. But that doesn’t mean the underlying behaviors aren’t real. I’ve seen them up close - especially in early-stage startups. After working for some incredibly large organizations such as Cerner Corporation and UnitedHealth Group , I expected startups to feel different. And they did. Fast. Flat. Energizing. We moved without red tape. Everyone had a seat at the table. It was intoxicating. But post-COVID, something shifted. A wave of new founders entered the market - often without real-world experience managing people, operating in healthcare, or navigating growth. They had strong networks, strong opinions, and weak leadership instincts. And when things got hard, they didn’t self-reflect. They projected. They blamed experienced leaders instead of learning from them. They rewrote facts to preserve ego. They pushed out the talent doing the real work. Then wondered why everything fell apart. I’ve seen incredible operators leave, not because they weren’t delivering, but because they were slowly being made to feel like the problem. It’s not always intentional. Sometimes it’s just fear, inexperience, or unchecked insecurity. But the damage is the same. And this is where VCs and boards need to take ownership. If you see dysfunction creeping in - intervene. You have the tools and resources to bring in coaches, advisors, or experienced operators to help founders grow into the leaders their companies need. Don’t wait until the capital is gone and your best people are too burned out to care. For every three founders who spiral like this, I’ve worked with seven who are the real deal: collaborative, passionate, humble, and constantly learning. They build incredible companies because they’re willing to grow themselves first. Startups don’t implode because of market fit alone. They implode when no one’s willing to call out when leadership is the problem. Healthcare is too complex, and too human, for this cycle to keep repeating. Let’s raise the bar.

They were charging $50K annually per hospital but revenue was stuck at $2M with 40 customers. 18 months later, they hit $7.2M ARR with the same customer base. The secret wasn't just changing the pricing model - it was proving undeniable value first. We implemented five low-cost, high-impact changes that transformed how customers experienced the product: 1. Comprehensive staff training programs (clinical + administrative teams) 2. We assigned dedicated success managers for white-glove onboarding and ongoing optimization. 3. Monthly benchmark reports showed each hospital exactly how they compared to peers. 4. Quarterly business reviews brought C-suite recommendations directly to decision makers. 5. And 24/7 support with sub-2-hour response times made them feel truly supported. Once customers were seeing measurable results and feeling the premium experience, we aligned our pricing to the value we were creating. Then We Restructured Pricing: 🚨 Old Model: Fixed $50K fee (seen as cost center) 📈 New Model: Outcome-based tiers 1. Foundation: $30K base + 15% of documented savings 2. Growth: $40K base + 20% of savings + performance bonuses 3. Partnership: $50K base + 25% of savings + revenue share The psychology shift was everything: customers stopped asking ""What does this cost?"" and started asking ""How much are we making together?"" The results: ✅ Average contract value: $50K → $180K ✅Customer lifetime value increased 340% ✅ Churn dropped to 3% (customers making money don't leave) The lesson?

Most founders answer with tactics: ""We do cold outreach and attend conferences."" But GTM isn't about what you do—it's about how you think. The right question is: ""How do you create and capture value in healthcare's complex buying environment?"" This forces you to consider: 1. Your buyer's actual decision-making process 2. How clinical, financial, and technical stakeholders align 3. What triggers budget allocation in your target accounts 4. How you'll prove ROI in a risk-averse industry At Health Tech House, we don't just build sales processes. We build commercial thinking frameworks that scale.

You can't just pivot to VBC when the market demands it. The buying cycles are 18+ months. The integration requirements are complex. The compliance standards are non-negotiable.

And if you don't understand it, neither will potential buyers or, more importantly, Series A investors. Healthcare buyers are drowning in vendor pitches. They have 15 minutes of attention, not 50. Your job isn't to tell them everything; it's to tell them enough to want more. This applies equally to your sales pitch and your investor pitch. Here's the 5-slide framework that actually works, both for sales and for laying the groundwork for a compelling investor narrative: Slide 1: The Problem. One specific, expensive problem your buyer (or the market) loses sleep over. Slide 2: The Impact. What happens if they don't solve it (costs, risks, missed opportunities). Slide 3: The Solution. How you solve it differently (your unique approach, not just a list of features). Slide 4: The Proof. One powerful customer story with specific outcomes or compelling market validation. Slide 5: The Next Step. Clear, specific next action (a deeper dive, a pilot, an ROI discussion, or an investor follow-up). That's it. No lengthy company overview. No feature laundry list. No 20-minute product demo. Just laser focus on their problem and your solution.

It reflects growing pressure on the MA model and signals potential downstream effects for digital health companies, particularly those seeking risk-based partnerships with MA plans. Here’s what this means for the digital health sector: ➡️ Longer sales cycles. Health plans are likely to slow down or pause new vendor engagements while they reassess financial exposure and operational priorities. ➡️ Greater demand for demonstrated ROI. Startups offering shared savings, virtual care, or care navigation solutions will face more scrutiny. Strong evidence of measurable impact will be essential to move forward. ➡️ A shift in investor focus. Venture capital may become more conservative in backing MA-aligned startups unless the solution directly supports cost containment, denial prevention, or coding optimization.

My dad recently took his own life with a firearm. And when people ask, I usually just say, “I’m fine.” Because it’s easier. Because sometimes the real answer feels too big to put into words. The truth is: I’m not suicidal. I’m angry. I feel like maybe I could have done more — given him more purpose, been more available, shown more compassion for the addiction he fought my entire life. I carry guilt. I carry sadness. I carry the weight of wishing things had been different. And sometimes, I carry the exhaustion of feeling like a broken record of baggage. But even with all of that — I’m still here. I still have goals. I still have dreams. I still have people who depend on me. And I’m still fiercely committed to moving forward without letting my past define my future. Because honestly? What other choice do I have? Right now, my personal motto is simple: stay busy and stay useful. It’s what’s helping me keep my footing in a world that feels a little less steady these days. But if I’m being fully honest — survival looks different for everyone. Some people push their feelings down just to get through the day. Some people fall apart and rebuild piece by piece. Some people bounce between the two, hour by hour. And all of it is okay. There’s no “right” way to carry grief, or pain, or anger, or guilt. There’s just your way. And whatever that looks like — it’s valid. If you’ve reached out to me and I haven’t responded, please just know: I’m okay. I’m fine.

Team happy hours, leadership town halls, and company all-hands meetings are full of optimism. Wins are frequent, promotions are plentiful, and even the occasional setback is met with a rallying cry: We’ll bounce back! But when you start missing goals - quarter after quarter - that energy shifts. Leadership starts pointing fingers. Teams go into survival mode. I don’t think we talk about this enough, especially in the world of healthcare sales, where the market dynamics are fundamentally different from selling into other industries. Half the leadership teams don’t fully understand the nuance and length of selling into healthcare, which means they mismanage their teams, set unrealistic expectations, and blame the wrong factors when deals stall. The other half do understand the nuance—but they spend the majority of their time fighting for airtime, struggling to gain buy-in for a strategy they know would work. If you had asked me in my 20s if culture mattered, I would have said no. I could brush off bad leadership and just focus on the work. But the reality? A few bad leaders can tank an entire company. Their toxicity spreads like cancer - undermining morale, trust, and momentum. And unless there are other leaders willing to stand up and say enough, to cut off the cancer before it spreads, the entire company can go down with the ship.

Ask mid-level managers what they’re working on and how it aligns with the company’s goals for the year. If they don’t know - or worse, if they haven’t even been given the company goals, you’ve got a big problem at the top. Oftentimes, this is an arbitrary exercise led by HR through tools like Lattice - but its ultimately the VP levels and above that are responsible to ensure every role underneath them has clear alignment to their job responsibilities and how their day to day work is contributing to the larger picture. The reality is some leaders have a vision, but they can’t sell it. They hire people to execute their vision but fail to provide a strategy. Teams running on tactics alone, hoping the vision will someday materialize. I have seen it so many times and continue to ponder how these people continue to stay in positions of leadership when they have no real roadmap for their own company, let alone people. Dare I say some of these ""leaders"" that carry a c-suite title may have a shiny pedigree and a way with the BOD, but to their own people? Their own teams? They are uninspiring, disconnected and likely cant tell you what most people do at their company. They surround themselves with talented people but provide no direction beyond lofty ambitions. The team is left scrambling, relying on individual tactics with no clear path to execution. And hope, as we know, is not a strategy. It's rare but good leadership does exist. - A strong leader has a vision—but also knows they need people to build the strategy that brings it to life. AND they provide direction on how to go execute it. - That strategy then informs tactical execution, ensuring every task at every level contributes to the broader goal. - Without strategy, teams are left doing busywork, checking boxes, and spinning their wheels—leading to disengagement and burnout. The real problem? When people aren’t given purposeful work, it drains the culture. Whether you’re an analyst or a VP, you want to feel valuable. You want to know your work is contributing to something greater. Leaders who fail to connect vision with execution aren’t just slowing progress—they’re failing their teams.

This reduction, driven by the need to maintain budget neutrality, has left many physicians struggling to balance rising practice costs with declining reimbursements. A critical issue to highlight is the long-term impact of these cuts. According to the American Medical Association , when adjusted for inflation, Medicare reimbursement for physician services has declined a staggering 33% from 2001 to 2025. This decline underscores the growing financial strain on physicians, who are increasingly challenged to provide quality care amidst shrinking resources. Here’s what you need to know about the 2025 Medicare pay cuts and the ongoing legislative efforts to address them: 1️⃣ The 2.83% cut is the third consecutive annual reduction. When adjusted for inflation, this equates to a 6.3% real pay reduction for physicians in 2025. 2️⃣ Physician pay has barely increased over the past two decades. Since 2001, Medicare reimbursements have risen just 9% — an average of 0.4% per year — while the cost of running a medical practice has surged by 59%. 3️⃣ The impact will be most severe for small, independent, and rural practices. These cuts also disproportionately affect providers serving low-income and marginalized communities. 4️⃣ The cuts are tied to expiring temporary measures and a freeze on inflation updates. A temporary 2.93% payment adjustment expired at the end of 2024, and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act froze fee schedule inflation updates until 2026. There is some hope on the horizon. A bipartisan group of lawmakers recently reintroduced a bill aimed at reversing the 2025 cuts and providing much-needed stability for physician practices. Read the Press Release here: https://lnkd.in/eFgNt9yP The proposed legislation includes a 2% pay bump, along with a 4.73% increase tied to inflation, using the Medicare Economic Index as a benchmark. If passed, the “Medicare Patient Access and Practice Stabilization Act” would retroactively address the cuts from January 1 through March 31 and provide a 6.62% payment increase for the remainder of the year. Many organizations, including the American Medical Association (AMA), have voiced strong support for this legislation. AMA President Dr. Bruce Scott emphasized that Medicare payments, when adjusted for inflation, have fallen 33% over the past two decades, leaving physicians struggling to care for an aging and chronically ill population. hashtag # medicare hashtag # policy hashtag # advocacy hashtag # healthcare hashtag # inflation",8mo,3,0,0,No,,

Whether it’s breaking news, skincare hacks, a virtual cruise ship tour, or a quick laugh from farm animal videos, TikTok delivers like no other. No surprise that 180 million Americans are on the platform. But TikTok isn’t just about entertainment—it’s a lifeline for creators and small businesses. With features like monetization, affiliate marketing, and TikTok Shop, it’s reshaping how people connect, market, and sell. Over 7 million U.S. businesses rely on TikTok to engage customers, generating $14.7 billion in revenue and supporting 224,000 jobs in 2023 alone (Oxford Economics). Compare this to other platforms: 🔴 Instagram: A never-ending scroll of ads. 🔴 Facebook: Outdated content from distant acquaintances. 🔴 LinkedIn & X: Overrun with bots and spam. TikTok, by contrast, prioritizes discovery, creativity, and authenticity—qualities that have made it a favorite for users and businesses alike. So, why the push to ban TikTok? Let’s be honest—it’s not about protecting user data. Tech giants like Meta, Google, X, and even Apple collect and sell our data. Data breaches? Rampant. Credit card fraud? Common. Misinformation? Everywhere. Yet TikTok has become the scapegoat. Why? Follow the money. Here’s the hard truth: 44 members of Congress who supported the TikTok ban own shares in competing tech companies like Meta. Together, they hold between $29 million and $126 million in these stocks. Nancy Pelosi alone owns 5,000 shares of Meta. This isn’t about national security—it’s about crushing competition. The consequences? Banning TikTok won’t fix data privacy or misinformation. It will, however, hurt millions of creators, small businesses, and the economy. This platform is more than an app; it’s a cultural and economic movement. That’s why, as of this weekend, I’m deactivating my Meta and X accounts.

But here’s the kicker: neither role offered a base salary. One was equity-only for a seed-stage company. The other? A “promise” of a base salary and equity after $1M in sales—despite having no product-market fit. Let me be clear: without sales, your company fails. You can have the best idea, the most revolutionary tech, or a Nobel Prize-winning advisor on your deck—but if you’re not selling, none of that matters. And if you’re asking someone to lead your sales strategy, especially at the executive level, they deserve to be compensated fairly from day one. If you aren’t willing to lead the sales efforts yourself, don’t expect an expert to do it for free while you figure out the basics of your business. I understand the hustle of being a founder—I’ve advised well over a dozen companies that had founder led sales team and then helped them to scale beyond that. I’ve advised mature companies where sales had stalled, investments in poor leaders led to missing their quota but NEVER was it suggested to not pay a sales leader - even if they failed. This mindset—expecting seasoned professionals to work for equity alone or dangling compensation based on future milestones—is not just unsustainable, it’s insulting. To founders operating this way: 1. Respect the expertise you’re asking for. 2. Budget for leadership roles like the mission-critical functions they are. 3.

UnitedHealthcare's 2025 GLP-1 exclusion exposes both short-sighted economics and deeper systemic failures. Let's break down what's really happening and the math they are intentionally ignoring: Obesity drives our costliest chronic conditions: - Type 2 Diabetes: $327B yearly - Heart Failure: $30B yearly - COPD: $50B yearly When we have effective treatments for obesity, denying access isn't cost control—it's cost deferral. Here's what's really at stake: ➡️ Narrow Clinical Pathways: Insurance companies are redefining 'medical necessity' to exclude obesity treatment, even as research shows these medications reduce heart disease, improve sleep apnea, and lower joint stress. They're creating a false divide between treating diabetes and treating obesity. ➡️ The Real Cost Equation: Yes, GLP-1s are expensive. But insurers aren't publicly discussing the long-term savings from preventing diabetes complications, reducing joint replacements, and improving cardiovascular outcomes. Short-term thinking is driving long-term costs. ➡️ Access Inequity: The 'pay cash' workaround means only affluent patients can access these medications consistently. We're creating a two-tier system where proven medical treatments are available based on wealth, not medical need. The Path Forward: 1. Value-based contracts that tie drug pricing to patient outcomes 2. Smart coverage criteria that supports comprehensive treatment plans 3. Integrated programs that combine medication with lifestyle support We're not choosing between covering or not covering GLP-1s. We're choosing between reducing obesity prevalence now or costly complications later. Question for healthcare leaders: How do we break this cycle of short-term cost cutting that drives long-term health inequities? hashtag # HealthcareInnovation hashtag # HealthEquity hashtag # ValueBasedCare hashtag # PreventiveCare """,9mo,10,2,0,No,,

If you’re not leveraging AI to turn mundane tasks into seconds instead of minutes (or hours), you’re already behind. This weekend, I used AI to help me meal prep for the week and put together a grocery list. I thought it’d be fun to share the prompts I use regularly to: -Accelerate my daily workflow. -Have more time to focus on clients and family. -Create a running history of solutions I can reuse throughout the year. Planning healthy, family-friendly meals can feel overwhelming, but AI tools like ChatGPT make it incredibly simple. Recently, I built a full anti-inflammatory meal plan for my family using AI, and it saved me hours of work. Here’s how you can do the same! Step-by-Step Guide with Prompts 1️⃣ Start with a Clear and Detailed Prompt Tell ChatGPT exactly what you need. Here’s the prompt I used: ""I need help creating an anti-inflammatory meal plan for two adults and one child. We want to focus on high-protein meals with healthy carbs. My spouse does not like tomatoes, so please avoid those. I would like one meal per week to be made in the crockpot for easy reheating. Please create a weekly schedule of breakfasts, lunches, and dinners that meets these requirements."" 👉 Pro tip: Modify the details to fit your needs (e.g., keto, vegan, gluten-free). 2️⃣ Refine the Plan Once the meal plan was ready, I asked ChatGPT to customize further. For example: ""Adjust the grocery list for this meal plan to reflect items I already have, including [list your items]. Remove duplicate or unnecessary items to streamline the list."" 3️⃣ Use AI to Save Time In just minutes, I had: ✅ A full week of anti-inflammatory meals. ✅ A tailored grocery list. ✅ A planning process that was easy, stress-free, and family-approved. How to Use This for Yourself Here’s the exact formula to get started: ➡️ Identify your goals: Be specific about dietary preferences, the number of people, and any constraints (e.g., likes/dislikes). ➡️ Give ChatGPT clear instructions: Use the prompts above as a template. ➡️ Iterate: Refine the plan to match your pantry and lifestyle. ChatGPT isn’t just for work—it’s a tool to improve your everyday life. Whether you’re meal planning, organizing your schedule, or brainstorming creative ideas, AI can help you save time and stay on track.

If you’re still relying on generic content to engage your audience, you're missing out on a huge opportunity.

Let’s call this what it is—a calculated move to restrict access to GLP-1s, even as their clinical applications continue to expand (obesity, diabetes and now sleep apnea). The timing isn’t accidental. Here’s what’s really happening: -Payers are scrambling to control costs. With record-high spending on GLP-1 drugs, insurers are adjusting policies to offset financial strain. -Pharma keeps pushing prices up. The explosive demand for these medications has led to double-digit growth quarter over quarter, with no signs of slowing. -Patients are demanding access. A recent KFF survey found that 80% of U.S. adults believe insurers should cover weight loss drugs for those diagnosed as overweight or obese, and half are willing to accept higher premiums for that coverage. -Providers are caught in the crossfire. They’re left navigating prior authorizations and restrictive policies while trying to deliver care. The industry can try to hide behind benefit exclusions and prior authorizations, but the demand isn’t going away. Patients are getting savvier about their options and increasingly frustrated with the “deny and delay” strategy employed by insurers. This isn’t just a question of whether these medications should be covered—it’s a battle over who blinks first: payers, pharma, or patients finding alternative paths to access. The stakes are high. GLP-1 drugs are forcing insurers, employers, and policymakers to confront uncomfortable truths about healthcare coverage and cost. If the industry doesn’t figure this out soon, the pressure from patients and providers alike could break the system. What’s your take?

This year brought profound personal challenges: wrestling with chronic pain, weathering hurricanes, supporting my son through a broken arm, and experiencing devastating losses of loved ones. These moments tested my resilience in ways I never expected. Yet professionally, 2024 was transformative. I discovered a sustainable work-life rhythm, embraced new challenges that pushed my boundaries, achieved unprecedented financial milestones, and getting ready to launch my first D2C product – a venture that fills me with excitement and gratitude as I know its built to serve future care takers and patient advocates. Rather than traditional New Year's resolutions, I'm approaching 2025 with focused intentions: - Setting ambitious yet achievable financial targets that will require dedication, strategic thinking and of course execution - Prioritizing physical and mental health as non-negotiable pillars of sustainable success - Creating more opportunities for intentional and quality time with our rapidly growing 7-year-old (who's somehow already acting like a teenager) - Creating more memories through travel, with two trips already planned for Q1 and more weekend adventures on the horizon As I close this chapter of 2024, I'm choosing a different path than the typical New Year's resolutions that often fade by February. Instead, I'm taking inventory of both the valleys and peaks of this year – leaving behind the weight of what broke me, while carrying forward the strength I found in breaking through.

With fresh leadership coming on board with the new administration, we’re seeing bold conversations about the future of health in America. Here are my predictions for the trends that will shape the year ahead: 1️⃣ AI in Healthcare: From Buzzword to Bedside -Expect accelerated adoption of AI in healthcare. -Precision medicine and clinical decision support tools will move from pilot programs to everyday practice. -AI’s ability to reduce administrative burden will be a lifeline for overworked clinicians, streamlining documentation, billing, and care coordination. The challenge: maintaining patient and provider trust in AI requires radical transparency and clear ethical boundaries. 2️⃣ Mental Health Finally Gets the Attention It Deserves -Employers will increasingly invest in mental health programs as the ROI becomes undeniable. -Digital platforms are exploding, but consumers and regulators alike will demand proof of outcomes and higher accountability. -A renewed focus on mental health parity could bring meaningful reform to coverage policies. 3️⃣ The Workforce Crisis in Healthcare -The pandemic's aftershocks and systemic burnout have led to a workforce at its breaking point. -Expect policies that aim to incentivize retention and bring innovative workforce solutions to the table. -Clinicians will leave traditional roles in droves, opting for concierge medicine or entrepreneurship that allow them to focus on patient care and innovation —not paperwork. 4️⃣ Pharma and Payers: A Reckoning -RFK Jr. has made transparency and accountability a cornerstone of his leadership. Combine that with Dr. Oz's focus on preventive care, and the status quo is being challenged like never before. -Drug pricing will face heightened scrutiny, with the public demanding fair access to life-saving medications like GLP-1s. -Payers will need to justify their role in restricting care or risk losing consumer trust entirely. 5️⃣ Breaking Free from Traditional Insurance Change Is Coming -The biggest shift I see? A growing resistance to the employer-based insurance model. Consumers are saying enough is enough and exploring: Concierge medicine, Direct primary care and Hybrid plans that cover emergencies only, leaving traditional payers on the sidelines. People want healthcare that’s personalized, affordable, and tailored to their family—not a one-size-fits-none solution.

I believe if we are going to pay the exorbitant amount of taxes that we do, I would like to see basic healthcare options provided to all tax paying Americans such as annual wellness visits, non emergency services and access to telehealth visits for my rural communities. But Brett, that is universal healthcare. 🧐 You’re right, it is…. (Or a version of it) Here is my issue that seems to be lost by many: Medicare is set to become insolvent (once again) by 2036. Social security will become insolvent by 2033. When my grandfather was recently discharged from the hospital (a retired Air Force Major) the wait list to get him into a VA skilled nursing facility was 6-8 weeks…. Which he did not have that much time left so we were forced to move him to a rehab facility and pay out of pocket for it due to him being ineligible for that facility because he was on warfarin. Show me a federal government that is capable of balancing a budget, providing transparency to the American people. Show me a federal run agency that can pass an annual audit (not fail their 6th) and being unable to account for all of its $3.8 trillion in assets and $4 trillion in liabilities. Show me a federal program that is not heavily persuaded by lobbyist (specifically pharmaceutical companies) when it comes to what policies they push.

Compare that to the US in 2022: 17.3% GDP, or $13,493 (£10,589) per person. Wild, right? It should be noted that the population im referring to based on the UK figures is only 67m and their marginal tax rate is 60% 🤡 In comparison, the US population is 330m with taxes ranging anywhere from 3.2% (lowest 20%) up to 37% (top 1%). However, what surprised me was that the UK’s universal healthcare covers primary care, hospital services, maternity, mental health, community health, ambulance services, and prescribed medications—but 20% of residents also pay for private insurance. Why? To avoid long waits, choose their doctors, or access services not covered by the NHS. Their system isn’t perfectly equal, but I could see where diplomacy at our confessional level could find middle ground somewhere in there. Healthcare isn’t one-size-fits-all; chronic illnesses like my endometriosis show how needs vary by age, race, genetics, and more. What the US needs is a shift from reactive care to prevention. We are currently a system (intentionally) built to treat the symptoms, keeping us sick and reacting to disease versus mitigating it. Imagine the savings we could achieve if every American had access to an annual wellness visit through a universal plan, reducing ED visits and improving overall health. If I had more confidence that our government wasn't completely corrupt from the top down, I would be happy to pay for high taxes to go towards a similar structure, under the assumption that you would be required to have an annual wellness visit as part of that plan... in addition, we need to incentivize more people to go into the business of medicine meaning medical school and nursing school should be subsidized in some way shape or form (havent figured that one out yet). In order to make a system like this work, with our large geography and population, we need more clinicians, more automation (more AI), and wild transparency about the cost of prescriptions. No more price gouging, no more payer dictating which medications they will ""allow,"" no more pharma advertising their drugs on TV and no more pharma lobbyist on capital hill or in bed with food manufactures/farmers.

Let me be clear, my skepticism about universal healthcare isn't rooted in opposition to access, but in the track record of policy implementation. Take the ACA's results since 2010: -Family premiums rose 74% (22% after inflation adjustment) -Many lost existing plans despite contrary promises -Independent practices consolidated, reducing competition -Drug prices doubled while congressional stockholders profited With Medicare facing insolvency by 2031 and current programs struggling with transparency and fiscal responsibility, why trust the same system with universal healthcare? Meanwhile, private insurers have overstepped their role. Instead of focusing on risk management and policyholder protection, they're dictating care, creating narrow networks, and implementing arbitrary claim denials. Real reform needs to prioritize patient care and transparency – both in government programs and private insurance. Until then, I remain skeptical of expanding a system that's already showing serious cracks. hashtag # HealthcareReform hashtag # HealthPolicy hashtag # Healthcare",10mo,4,0,0,No,,

My son sat with me through it all, offering feedback and the occasional Kleenex - because yes, writing this while processing my grief for my grandfather isn't easy.

The insurance company, not a doctor, decides your health doesn’t warrant the treatment. Now, it’s not just medications. Insurance companies are increasingly inserting themselves into clinical decisions they are unqualified to make. Take, for example, the recent uproar over new anesthesia time limits set by Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield Providers are sounding the alarm, because these arbitrary limits prioritize cost savings over patient safety. When I had my hysterectomy last year, my anesthesia alone was billed at $39,798? I had complications once they got in there, so was under for almost an hour longer than anticipated. So, Anthem expects me to pick up that bill now? Why are non-clinicians deciding how much anesthesia a patient needs? This trend is alarming. It erodes trust, delays care, and forces providers to fight for their patients instead of focusing on treatment. It begs the question: When did insurers become the gatekeepers of care, overriding the judgment of licensed providers who know us best? We need more transparency, advocacy, and accountability.

I’ve spent the last year navigating personal health struggles and the heartbreaking loss of my grandfather, which forced me to confront just how broken our post-acute care system is. It left me cynical—not just about the healthcare system, but about my own career. For a long time, I felt like I was losing purpose and hope, questioning whether meaningful change was even possible. But this week, I had two client calls with health tech companies outside the U.S. that completely shifted my perspective.

For the first time in a long time, I feel hopeful—not just for the future of healthcare, but for my role in driving change.

In 2010, we were promised a healthcare revolution with the Affordable Care Act (ACA)—a system that would reduce costs, improve outcomes, and serve all Americans equitably. Fourteen years later, the data tells a different story. ➡️ Healthcare spending remains as concentrated as ever. In 2010, the top 5% of healthcare spenders accounted for 50% of total spending. In 2023, that figure hasn’t budged. Meanwhile, the bottom 50% of Americans—those least able to afford care—still account for less than 3% of the total spend. ➡️ The cycle of sickness and profit continues. Our system is in purgatory: ❌ We feed people foods that make them sick—even those who “eat healthy” under outdated guidelines like the food pyramid. ❌ We treat symptoms with medications that often come with devastating side effects, many of which aren’t covered by insurance. ❌ We fail to prioritize primary care, reducing their Medicare payment per relative value unit, decreasing by 2.83% from 2024 to 2025, the frontline of preventative medicine, where investment could save lives. ➡️ Corruption runs deep. ❌ The ties between Big Food, Big Pharma, government, for-profit, and academic health systems are choking our nation’s health.

Because the venture capital world’s rapid-fire expectations for growth doesn’t align with the long, complex timelines required for meaningful progress in healthcare. In the rush to capture market share, we saw an explosion of health tech startups, but at what cost? Instead of solving the industry’s most pressing issues, the influx of well-funded companies often cluttered the landscape with more intricate workflows, fragmented credentialing processes, and very few universally applied standards of care. For years, it felt like a gold rush—a mad dash to build the “next big thing” and secure the next funding round. But in that sprint for financial gain, we’ve lost sight of the end user: patients and practitioners who need reliable, integrated solutions. The health tech sector isn’t like other tech industries; growth here isn’t just about speed or scale—it’s about sustained, measurable improvements in patient outcomes and workflow efficiencies for healthcare providers. So where does this leave us now? Saddled with disconnected tools and an industry overwhelmed by a flood of shiny solutions, all vying for a slice of the same pie. And sadly, too many promising ideas fell by the wayside, not because they weren’t valuable, but because they couldn’t fit the “grow fast or die” mantra.

He went to every dance competition, came to every orchestra concert, hosted my childhood sleepovers, took my friends to haunted houses and more importantly was always available to help me regardless of the hour up until he took his last breath.

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7257350568598212608/,"8 Brutal Truths About Health Tech That Might Make Founders Sweat 👇 1️⃣ If a hospital charges you to conduct a clinical study but doesn’t sign a commercial contract (purchase) your product afterward (even with “great results”)… that’s a clear sign of weak product-market fit. The market speaks with its budget, not just feedback. 2️⃣ Flashy tech and well-known VC backers might get you in the door. Clinical expertise, practical impact and RELATIONSHIPS seal real partnerships. 3️⃣ Procurement isn’t the gatekeeping monster some make it out to be. If your product is a true “must-have,” procurement hurdles can disappear; if it’s a “nice-to-have,” expect them to multiply. 4️⃣ Health systems aren’t anti-innovation; they’re just smart about ROI. If adoption is slow, the value might not be strong enough—or it’s not solving a big enough problem for them. 5️⃣ Shiny tech without embedded clinical workflows is a recipe for failure. All the bells and whistles won’t help if they don’t improve care delivery or outcomes. 6️⃣ There’s no “fast track” to a signed contract. No board connection or single internal champion can magically turn your product into an instant buy. Real traction comes from solving a broad and urgent need. 7️⃣ If you’re a “health tech company” but 70% of your team is operations—are you truly tech enabled? Or just an ops-driven product with tech features that demand manual lift and bring zero optimization? Let’s not put lipstick on a pig and call it tech enabled better yet throw AI into your tagline. 8️⃣ Revenue-driven products will almost always outshine those focused on clinical outcomes. The reality is that in the US (and around the world), health systems are more drawn to financial impact than they’ll admit in public. What resonates with you here?

The conferences won't shut up about it. VCs are throwing billions at it. And they're all missing the point. The REAL revolution in healthcare costs won't come from repackaging how we deliver mediocre treatments. It'll come from not needing those treatments in the first place. Disease-modifying therapies are the silent killer of healthcare costs: Halt Type 1 Diabetes? Goodbye daily insulin dependence Stop Alzheimer's progression? No more decades of care Prevent heart disease? Scrap those recurring hospital visits Virtual care attempts makes broken systems more efficient and accessible. Value-based care just reorganizes who pays for subpar outcomes. Stop managing symptoms. Start preventing diseases.
