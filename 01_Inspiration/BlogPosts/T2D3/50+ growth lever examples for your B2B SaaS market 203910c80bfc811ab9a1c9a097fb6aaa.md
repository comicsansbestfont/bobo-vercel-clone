If you’re leading a growth planning exercise with your leadership team and unsure of what to include in each quadrant of your Ansoff Matrix, here’s a collection of examples to help you get started. I’ve broken this article into four parts—one for each quadrant. In each section, I’ve explained the quadrant conceptually with overarching ‘themes’ then provided some specific examples of growth levers you might use to achieve B2B SaaS growth.Quadrant 1 - Market penetrationExisting product | Existing customersQuadrant 1 is about patching your funnel leaks and upgrading its component parts. In other words, find more customers that look like your existing customers, and optimize your existing product, sales, marketing, and customer success mix. This quadrant contains a core growth strategy once you've achieved some form of product-market fit (PMF). For companies under ~$10 million ARR, focusing on market penetration should be your primary growth strategy.Growth levers in this quadrant should focus on the below:Themes:Improve funnel conversionOptimize handoff from marketing to salesIncrease prices for existing customersCreate upsell opportunitiesOptimize prices Remove bad-fit customers (or find more good-fit) Convert existing content or services into products (or marketing assets)Create new sales, marketing, or customer success assetsFind new/better ways to attract more customers like the ones you already haveCreate (or buy) more market shareImprove the performance of your marketing campaignsGrowth lever examples:Create upsell campaigns for highly engaged customers Enrich customer data and use findings to refine ICP and pilot an account-based marketing programLaunch a user referral programCollect testimonials and reviews from ICP customersAnalyze current SERP rankings and optimize page 2/3/4 articlesBuy market share through an acquisitionOptimize pricing based on customer data and competitive trendsAdd more variables to pricing to drive up ACV for heavy-usage customersCapture existing demand through new PPC campaignsCreate more detailed documentation to help customers onboard themselvesIdentify common flags that signal a customer is likely to churn and create automation to provide extra supportAdd annual price escalators into all new contractsTurn introductory sales team demos into pre-recorded demos for the website to improve inbound MQL qualityCreate a partner program to incentivize referralsRecruit and enable partner resellersEngage partners in thought leadership contentCreate more documentation to help customers onboard themselvesLaunch onboarding videos to address high-volume customer support issuesReduce problem customers (eliminate non-strategic customers)Launch a new YouTube channel/podcast/content series/original data research projectReduce CAC of existing demand-generation campaigns (PPC, paid search, etc.)Build a community of power users (user group)Quadrant 2 - Market developmentExisting product | New customersQuadrant 2 is all about diversifying your customer acquisition channels.Complete this quadrant with levers that help you take your current offerings to new customer groups. These tactics are about expanding your beachheads and entering new market segments.Themes:Expand your ICP and personas to adjacent segmentsExplore partnerships to access new markets, complete your product offering, or lower the cost of salesExplore new regions, territories or industriesTest and optimize new demand-generation channelsAcquire an indirect competitor in an adjacent segmentGrowth lever examples:Sign on ten pilot customers in the hospitality verticalCreate new educational content and product marketing materials for medical directorsTest market-message fit with an account-based marketing campaign for a secondary ICP in healthcareCreate a new paid content distribution campaign to test acceptance in secondary verticalFocus on Europe as a new market (Build customer base in EU)White label primary product to attract agencies and consultantsClose our first ten large ACV-size contracts (ABM campaigns targeted at enterprise prospects)List our main product on the HubSpot Marketplace to access growing SMBsRun a pilot program with a partner resellerQuadrant 3 - Product DevelopmentNew product | Existing customersQuadrant 3 is about expanding your offerings to increase revenue. This quadrant often includes product improvements that increase your ARPU (average revenue per unit) or increase the ACV (average contract value) of your current customer base.Consider ways you can introduce new service offerings or add product capabilities that fit the needs of your current ICP—whether by building or buying them.Themes:Invest in research and development of new features for your existing customer base and prospects who fit your ICPLicense the right to use someone else’s technologyBuy new capabilities to integrate into your productImprove your value proposition through the introduction of new featuresGrowth lever examples:Add machine learning to the productOffer setup and configuration servicesBuild an integration with HubSpotBuild pre-populated templates for most common customer use-casesGet our main product "Salesforce certified" to become more trustworthyObtain SOC 2 complianceAdd OCR capabilities to our HR productsBuild a mobile version of our primary productAdd machine learning to the product as a featureFocus development efforts on our enterprise product backlog and create new pricing tier for power users Quadrant 4 - DiversificationNew product | New customersQuadrant 4 is about diversifying both your product and your market. Product diversification isn't easy, and most companies struggle to pull a market and customer pivot successfully.Use your marketing insights, competitive analysis, customer feedback, and market indicators to inform your decision to pursue tactics in quadrant 4. A real-life (and successful) example of product diversification is the shift distilleries made in 2020 from creating alcohol to hand sanitizer in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and shortages on medical and healthcare supplies.Themes:Develop new products for new markets based on a unique capabilityGrowth lever examples:Build integrations with low-end ERPs to attract small-businesses Build a XXX Integration and new go-to-market to complement it 3.
