Often, the difference between a mediocre marketing function and a great one is a leader who knows not just the essential marketing channels and best practices but has a library of sales, marketing, and product knowledge to refer to. Marketing is all about experimenting with all of the hundreds of possible marketing levers. Knowing all the possible levers to pull, when to pull them, and how to manage marketing’s eternally limited resources is what makes a great leader. B2B SaaS marketing certification courses are a great way for CMOs and other executives to quickly expand their bank of knowledge and learn more about how people outside their company manage and lead their marketing teams. In this article on the Kalungi blog, we took a look at some of the fast, valuable certification courses for marketers that not only show off your skill on LinkedIn but also give you a quick leg up on your next marketing campaign. However, in this piece, we’ll be taking a deeper dive into those certification courses that are a good fit for developing high-level strategy, managing executive conversations, and effectively leading a well-rounded marketing function.

Harvard Business School - Executive Education Programs Harvard’s rotating selection of Executive Education Programs offers leaders of B2B SaaS and non-software companies insights on driving effective sales and marketing strategy from an executive's perspective.

The downside? Many of these courses are not offered remotely, meaning they are most accessible to those who are able to stay near the Harvard campus for an extended period or those who live in the Boston/Cambridge area.
