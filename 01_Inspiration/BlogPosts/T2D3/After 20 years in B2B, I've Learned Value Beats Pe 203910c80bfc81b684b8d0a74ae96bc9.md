More B2B SaaS sales teams are adopting Account Based Marketing (ABM) to target high-value accounts and keep their attention focused on efforts that matter most (we hope you are too). I’ve spent over two decades in B2B SaaS marketing and sales, crafting thousands of emails to C-suite executives and budget-strapped founders. In my early years, I sweated over every comma and clever turn of phrase. I believed a perfectly formatted, grammatically pristine email was my ticket to a prospect’s calendar. I was wrong. What ultimately moves the needle in ABM outreach isn’t the polish – it’s the genuine value you deliver. It’s the trust you build, the personal relevance you demonstrate, and the insight you bring to the table. An email that actually helps the reader will beat a beautifully written piece of fluff every time. We live in a world of overflowing inboxes. Your target prospects (especially CMOs and founders) are laser-focused on their own priorities – your email is just a blip in their periphery. In fact, I like to think of a cold ABM email as something appearing in a prospect’s peripheral vision. It needs to catch their eye without triggering a fight-or-flight response. If your message is too loud, aggressive, or self-serving, it’s like a lion leaping into their field of view – they’ll either run (hit delete) or fight. Instead, you want to appear like a friendly face or a cute puppy: noticeable, disarming, and maybe even familiar. So how do you pass the Peripheral Vision Test in practical terms? It starts with your subject line and opening sentence. Those are the first things a busy reader skims in their email preview, and in that split second they decide “Do I care or not?” Your opener has to have enough contrast to stand out from the noise – something personal, relevant, or intriguing – but not so much that it screams “SALES PITCH!” and scares them off. In nature, bright colors or sudden movements get attention, but they can also signal danger. The same goes for outreach: grab attention gently. For example, leading with a generic... “Hi [First Name], I’m reaching out from X company about our solution… Would a quick chat next week be worth it? Best, [Your Name]" ...is the equivalent of a rustling bush with a predator behind it – it feels like a threat. On the other hand, an opener like... “[First Name], I noticed your team is hiring 5 engineers – I have a quick insight on tech recruiting you might find useful,” Best, [Your Name]" ...is more like seeing something intriguing yet safe in the corner of your eye. It’s specific to them and offers a nugget of value up front. Practical Tip: After you draft your subject line and first sentence, ask yourself honestly – if I were the reader, would this catch my eye in a good way? Or would I instinctively ignore it or delete it? This is your peripheral vision filter. Does the email look and feel “safe” at a glance (no overly salesy buzzwords, not a wall of text), yet different enough to pique curiosity Strive for a tone that is warm, human, and helpful rather than transactional. One technique is to use the prospect’s context right away in a helpful manner. For instance... “Saw your recent interview about CX automation – it sparked an idea that might save your team 30% onboarding time.” ...A line like that is about their world and signals immediate value, passing the peripheral test. It stands out, but in a friendly, relevant way. Remember, your email is an unwelcome guest in their day until proven otherwise. You have only a moment on the outskirts of their attention. Make it count, but don’t come on too strong. Stand out, don’t scare. As I often remind my team: be the puppy, not the lion in their inbox. Going a little deeper... Most bad outreach emails fail another test beyond the intro: they skip answering “Why should this person care?” and go straight to “Let me tell you about me and my amazing solution!” Most ABM emails go: “Hi, I’m so-and-so from XYZ Corp, we do this and that (insert 8-sentence value prop), can we schedule a call?” – and the sender wonders why nobody ever responds (or at least the response rate is very low). The issue is these type of emails don't give the reader a reason to care first. They are so excited to pitch (the “why us” or “why me” part) that they forget to establish any relevance or urgency first. This is where the Why Care, Why You (or Why Us), Why Now framework comes in. Here’s what that means: 1. Why Care This is the first and most crucial piece. Your message needs to answer, from the prospect’s perspective, “What’s in it for me? Why should I give a damn about what you’re saying?” Until you answer that, nothing else matters. In practice, this means leading with the prospect’s problem or goal, not your product. It could be a pain point they’re likely facing (“Hiring engineers is taking longer in this competitive market…”) or an opportunity they’d want (“...which means a fresh approach could cut your hiring time in half”). The key is to address a concern that already exists in their world. Remember, when you’re doing outbound, you’re knocking on the door of someone who wasn’t thinking about you at all before you showed up. They’re in a state of inertia, busy with their own tasks. If your email doesn’t immediately signal relief, benefit, or insight related to their priorities, you’ve lost them. As humans we subconsciously ask of any new stimulus, “Is this important to me, or can I ignore it?”. If you don’t explicitly answer “Why should they care?”, they will ignore you – guaranteed. 2. Why You (Be the Trusted Guide) Only after you’ve sparked their interest do you introduce why you or your company might be the solution. I sometimes call this the “trusted guide” phase. Think of it like this: once the prospect acknowledges, “Alright, you’ve got my attention, I do care about solving this hiring bottleneck (or whatever issue),” now they’ll wonder, “Who are you, and can you actually help with this?” This is where you very briefly establish credibility or unique value. It could be a one-liner that you’ve helped similar companies (“We helped another SaaS firm cut hiring time by 30% last quarter”) or an offer to share something genuinely useful (“I spent 10 hours researching a solution and put together a 1-page plan – happy to share it”). The mistake many make is starting here – blasting a case study or a product pitch without context. That’s like walking up to a stranger (or a date) and bragging about your achievements before you’ve even said hello. The prospect doesn’t care yet, so it’s premature. But once they do care about the problem, you must quickly and humbly show that you could be a guide worth listening to. A great metaphor I learned is the mountain guide: First, get them to decide they want to climb that mountain; only then do you say, “Hey, I’ve climbed it before, I can show you the way”. If they’re not interested in the climb, it doesn’t matter that you have the map. 3. Why Now Finally, give them a reason to engage now rather than later. Humans are procrastinators – even if they care and see you as a potential helper, they might think, “Sounds useful, I’ll get to this next week.” Sometimes a gentle nudge is needed. The trick here is to create legitimate urgency or relevance without resorting to cheesy pushiness (“Offer ends Friday!”). For example, tie your message to a timely event or insight: “I noticed you’re speaking at the TechX conference next month – my idea could potentially double your booth ROI, worth a quick chat before then?” Or use a bit of FOMO or consequence: “Companies that implement these changes before year-end are seeing big productivity gains – that’s why I’m reaching out now.” In our mountain guide analogy, why now is the equivalent of saying, “The climbing season is short – if we don’t tackle this by August, we’ll lose a year.” It provides a contextual reason that now is the time to act, not later. Most outreach emails that flop are guilty of skipping one of these steps (usually skipping Why Care). I recently saw a sales email that immediately led with a product brochure (“Attached is a guide to our platform…”). That’s pure “why us” content delivered before any attempt to make it relevant – essentially a pitch in the face of someone who didn’t ask for it. It triggered the immediate delete reflex in me. As I discussed with a colleague, sending a PDF unprompted is jumping to “here’s why we’re great” without earning the right to do so. There is a time and place to send your deck or case study – after the prospect believes there’s a problem worth solving and is interested in how you solve it. So, always sequence your message: hook their interest first (Why Care), show them you can help (Why You), and prompt timely action (Why Now). If that “Why Care” / “Why You” sequence sounds a bit like the stages of a relationship, that’s because it is. I often compare effective ABM outreach to dating or making a new friend. It’s a classic analogy, but it’s dead-on. You wouldn’t propose marriage to someone on a first date (I hope!). Nor would you walk up to a stranger at a bar and launch into a monologue about yourself, your family, and your life achievements – that would be bizarre and off-putting. Yet I see eager salespeople doing the equivalent via email all the time. Good ABM, like dating, is about establishing a connection and building rapport step by step, not closing the deal in one go. Picture this: you’ve moved to a new city and want to make friends, so you join a local gym. You spot someone who might be a potential friend. How do you approach them? Do you walk right up while they’re in the middle of a heavy squat and blurt out, “Hey, I see you’re squatting; I like squats too! We should be friends!”? Of course not – that would be awkward (and a little creepy). But in business outreach, that’s what superficial personalization can look like: “Hey, noticed you’re based in Toronto and love skiing. I’m based in Toronto and love skiing too. By the way, want to buy my software?” It’s a thin attempt at establishing common ground, transparently just a setup for a pitch. A better approach is to be genuinely interested and helpful. Maybe you notice this person at the gym is about to attempt a new personal record on their squat. A natural, friendly move would be to say, "Need a spotter?" – offering help at the moment it’s needed. Or even better, if you’re the one squatting, you might ask them for a spot. Interestingly, asking for a small favor can be a powerful way to start a relationship (more on the “asking for help” principle in a moment). The point is, you break the ice by adding value or warmth: a helpful gesture, a sincere compliment, or a question that shows you care about them. Maybe you comment on the obscure band T-shirt they’re wearing (because you happen to also love that band), which signals a real common interest. These are authentic touches that let a conversation spark naturally, rather than forcing it. In ABM terms, treating outreach like dating means prioritizing the relationship over the sale. Early on, your goal is not to close a deal; it’s to open a dialogue. This mindset shift changes how you write your emails. Instead of coming across as a pushy salesperson, you come across as a potential partner or peer. For example, rather than saying "Can I have 30 minutes to demo our product?" you might say... “I saw your recent blog on data security – it resonated because many fintech firms I talk to are struggling with XYZ. I have some thoughts that could save you some headaches; mind if I share?” The latter feels like one professional reaching out to another with a friendly offer, not a sales pitch. One of my favorite “dating” analogies in practice is simply taking it slow and natural. In dating, maybe you start by exchanging a few messages, then a casual coffee, then a real date. In ABM, an initial cold email might simply aim to start a conversation (“Does this challenge ring a bell for you?” or “I’d love your take on this trend I’m seeing…”). If they reply, that’s a small “yes” – akin to that first coffee. You don’t immediately slam them with calendar invites and sales decks; you nurture the conversation, share insights, maybe connect them with a resource (no strings attached). I’ve literally had prospect interactions where I didn’t pitch anything in the first couple of emails – I just offered some observations or asked a smart question about their strategy. It builds trust. By the time I do propose a meeting or demo, it doesn’t feel cold at all; it feels like a logical next step between two people who already kind of know each other. In short, treat your prospects like people, not targets. Focus on connection before conversion. When you do that, you’ll find prospects are much more receptive – they might even start coming to you for advice, which is the ultimate sign you’ve built a real relationship. Here’s a counterintuitive lesson it took me years to learn: sometimes the fastest way to establish trust and credibility is to admit you’re not all-knowing and actually ask the prospect for help or input. In other words, show some vulnerability. This flies in the face of the old-school sales mentality where you “never let them see you sweat” and you rattle off credentials to establish authority. But in modern ABM, especially when you’re reaching out to experienced executives, a humble approach can break down walls. Why does vulnerability work? Because it’s authentic. When you candidly ask someone for their perspective or help, you signal respect for their expertise. You’re implying, “You know things I don’t, and I value your insight.” That’s flattering in the right way – not sycophantic, but collaborative. It turns the interaction from a sales pitch into a peer-to-peer conversation. There’s also a psychological phenomenon at play called the Ben Franklin effect: when you ask someone for a small favor (like their opinion), and they oblige, they are more likely to like you because they helped you. They start to see you as someone they’ve invested in, even in a tiny way. In an ABM context, that could be asking, “Could you take 2 minutes to let me know if I’m on the right track with this hypothesis?” or “I’m working on a brief in your area of expertise – could really use your input on one question.” It’s amazing how a busy executive, who would ignore a sales pitch, might actually respond to a request for advice. Suddenly, the dynamic changes: you’re no longer just a salesperson; you’re a professional seeking their expert opinion. I’ve used this approach many times. For example, when targeting nonprofit CFOs for a fintech SaaS, I didn’t lead with “We have a solution to optimize your budget.” Instead, I said I was researching a report on budget optimization in nonprofits and had a few ideas, and I’d love to get a seasoned CFO’s take on whether those ideas held water. I made clear I wasn’t asking for a generic favor – I had done my homework (“I’ve drafted a one-page brief with some initial findings; happy to share”) and I truly wanted their perspective. The response rate to that outreach was multiple times higher than any traditional pitch we’d done. Prospects replied with genuine interest, correcting my assumptions, adding their own insights – essentially, engaging in a dialogue. A few eventually agreed to meetings to discuss further, at which point we naturally segued into how our solution might address the issues we discussed. They didn’t mind, because by then we had established a bit of a rapport, and I had shown respect for their knowledge. Another way to use vulnerability is by admitting a limitation. For instance, saying “I don’t have all the answers, but I’ve analyzed X, Y, Z and I wonder if you’re seeing the same?” This level of humility can be disarming. In one memorable case, I was reaching out to the CMO of a company and I opened with, “I’m going to admit upfront: I’m not 100% sure if what we offer can help you – only you’d know that – but I’ve identified a pattern with companies like [Their Company] that might be costing millions. Could you sanity-check me on this?”” That got a reply, and eventually a deal. The CMO said my approach stood out because everyone else was so sure their product was a fit without even knowing her situation, while I acknowledged uncertainty and asked to collaborate on figuring it out. To be clear, vulnerability is not the same as weakness. You’re not saying “please have pity on me.” You’re saying, “I value your expertise and would love your feedback.” You’re also subtly signaling confidence – it takes a secure person to admit they don’t know everything. It flips the script: rather than trying to prove you’re smart, you prove that you’re serious about learning what matters to them. That is hugely trust-building. One more tip: if you choose to go the vulnerability route, make sure you’ve done your prep work. Asking a busy exec to educate you on something you could have Googled is not cool. The ask has to feel meaningful. Like the example above, I didn’t ask, “What keeps you up at night?” (an overused and lazy question). Instead I said, “I think problem X might be a big deal for you given [reason]. Is that remotely close, or am I off base?” In a training session I led, I put it this way: if you’re asking someone for 5 minutes of their time, show that you put 10 minutes of your own time in first. Bring something to the table – a snippet of research, a draft plan, a specific question that shows you’ve been thinking. That makes the “ask for help” not only more compelling, but also more respectful. Some years ago, I stumbled on a recorded University of Chicago writing class (taught by Larry McEnerney) that completely reinforced what I was seeing in my own outreach: good writing isn’t about following grammar rules or using fancy words – it’s about offering insight and being crystal clear. In that lecture, McEnerney basically says: People will read your writing if it teaches them something or moves a conversation forward, and if it’s valuable to them. On the flip side, no one cares if your sentences are grammatically immaculate if you’re not saying anything useful. This hit home for me. For years I had prided myself on crafting grammatically perfect emails. I avoided typos like the plague, used high-level vocabulary to sound professional, adhered to “best practices” like no passive voice, etc. But some of those impeccably written emails fell flat because they lacked a compelling insight or a point of view that mattered to the prospect. Meanwhile, I’ve seen rough-looking emails – maybe a typo here or there, or not the slickest formatting – absolutely crush it because they immediately delivered value to the reader. Perhaps they revealed a stat or insight the prospect hadn’t seen, or distilled a complex issue in a way that made the reader go “huh, that’s interesting.” The writing was clear and straightforward, not necessarily fancy. That’s what counts. Here’s a reality check: Your prospect is skimming. They might be on their phone, between meetings, giving you maybe 15 seconds of attention at best. In that time, you need to change their thinking in a small way – even before they reply or agree to a call. Maybe you illuminate a problem they didn’t fully realize, or you validate a suspicion they had, or you simply phrase something in a way that resonates deeply with their experience. That’s what I aim for in every email now: one nugget of insight that makes it worth reading. If you don’t have that, no amount of grammatical perfection will save you. As the UChicago lesson emphasized, writing is about what readers find valuable, not what writers want to say. So before hitting send, I always check: Am I saying something that matters to this person? If not, rewrite until you are – even if that means breaking some “writing rules” to get there. I’ll give a concrete example: Suppose I’m writing to a CFO about automation in finance. A grammar-conscious, generic approach might start: “I am reaching out to introduce our platform, which leverages state-of-the-art technology to streamline financial workflows.” Grammatically correct? Yes. Valuable or insightful? Nope – it’s generic as can be. A clarity-and-insight approach might say: “Did you know 67% of finance teams spend 10+ hours/week on manual data entry? It’s a silent time-thief I suspect might be affecting your team. I have an idea to give those hours back.” Notice a few things: I started with a stat (teaches something, i.e., insight), and I phrased it in a way that’s easy to grasp. I even used a sentence fragment (“a silent time-thief”) which some English teachers might red-mark, but it paints a vivid picture. I’d rather risk a stylistic quibble and deliver a clear message, than be perfectly grammatical but dull. In that McEnerney class, they said real writing should ultimately change the reader’s perspective in some way. That’s what we should strive for in outreach writing. Make the reader nod and think, “This is interesting (and relevant)…” If you achieve that, they won’t care if you ended a sentence with a preposition or misplaced a comma. Here’s an ironic twist to everything I’ve said about not obsessing over grammar: I now let AI handle a lot of the grammar and word-smithing. The emergence of tools like GPT-4, ChatGPT, Claude, etc., has been a boon to marketers and sales folks like me – but only if used right. The wrong way is to have AI write generic spam (we’ve all seen what that looks like: “Dear Sir, I would like to schedule a call to discuss solutions that can synergistically improve your business…”). The right way, in my experience, is to use AI to polish and structure language, while you provide the raw insight and personal touch. My process these days often looks like this: I’ll spend 80-90% of my time researching the prospect and formulating the core message (the “why care” and the insight I want to share). I jot down bullet points of what I want to say – very rough, like “noticed they just expanded to Europe – likely struggling with multi-currency accounting; my past client had that issue – maybe share how we solved it.” These are messy notes, not pretty sentences. That’s where I invest my human brainpower: understanding the prospect and how I can help them. This is exactly the stuff AI cannot do for you – AI doesn’t have genuine human intuition about what a specific person or business might value (at least not yet). Once I have my rough points, I feed them to an AI writing assistant to help draft an email. Essentially, I supply the ingredients, AI helps bake the cake. The result? The email comes out well-structured, the tone can be adjusted to be on-brand (e.g. more formal or more casual, depending on what I prompt), and the grammar is flawless – all in a matter of seconds. I then review it and make tweaks to ensure it still sounds like me and hits all the key points. This approach has drastically reduced the time I spend agonizing over phrasing. It frees me up to focus on strategy and personalization. One thing I’ve emphasized when training my team on AI usage is: don’t outsource your thinking. If you just tell ChatGPT “write a prospecting email for product X” and hit send, you’re going to get a superficial, low-value output. It might be grammatically perfect, but it’ll likely fail the Why Care test and the Peripheral Vision test. Instead, do the deep work yourself – know your audience, find the angle that will make them care – then use AI as your copy editor and even idea expander. I might ask the AI, “rewrite this opening line to be more concise” or “give me three variations of this sentence with a friendly tone.” It’s fantastic at those micro-tasks. It’s also great for avoiding writer’s block once you have your talking points; seeing a full draft (even if it’s not perfect) is easier to edit than staring at a blank page. Another benefit: AI can help maintain consistency and professionalism once you’ve nailed the content. If you’ve done the hard part (figuring out the valuable insight and personalization), the AI can ensure the email flows logically and isn’t riddled with errors. Essentially, AI takes care of the polish – the very polish that I’ve been saying you shouldn’t obsess over. We humans should spend our precious time where it counts: understanding other humans. In one conversation with a colleague, I put it like this: Because of AI, you can spend nine of those ten minutes actually thinking about what the person cares about. Once you have that, the email is written in a second. The grammar, the style, the sentence structure – that’s grunt work you can delegate. Your job is the insight and the strategy. To make this concrete, let’s say I’ve identified a killer insight for a prospect and have a rough draft of an email. I’ll paste it into ChatGPT with a prompt like: “Make this sound polite yet impactful and ensure it’s no longer than 120 words. Maintain the tone of a helpful expert and keep the key points. Also, double-check grammar.” The output, 9 times out of 10, is a nicely tightened version of my message that I can basically copy-paste (with minor tweaks). This saves me from spending 30 minutes tinkering with wording. Multiply that time savings across a dozen accounts, and it’s a game-changer. But again – the quality of that final email still hinges entirely on the quality of the idea and personalization I put in initially. AI is a force multiplier, not a replacement for thinking. Let’s synthesize these concepts into something actionable. Over the years, I’ve developed a simple framework that I train my teams on for writing ABM emails. Think of it as a checklist to run through for every message you craft: 1. Know Your Reader (Do the Homework): Before writing a word, spend time researching the account and the individual. What do they likely care about? What recent events or challenges might be on their plate? Jot down at least 2-3 specific insights or hypotheses about their situation. This is your prep for “Why Care.” (No shortcuts – this is where the battle is won. Tools like LinkedIn, industry news, the company’s own press releases or blog can be goldmines.) 2. Pass the Peripheral Vision Test: Draft a subject line and opening sentence that reference the reader’s world. It could be something like “Quick idea for [hiring bottleneck] I noticed at [Company]” or a question like “Struggling with [X]? (saw something that might help)”. Make sure it stands out in their inbox preview and feels safe/legitimate (avoid spammy phrases, use their company name or a relevant keyword). Ask yourself: if this showed up on my phone lock screen, would I instinctively open it or swipe it away? 3. Why Should They Care?: In the first one or two sentences of the email body, identify a problem or opportunity that matters to them. This could be explicit (“Hiring engineers is taking 60+ days on average – I suspect this is slowing your product roadmap”) or implied via a question (“Ever find that international payments are a pain for nonprofits? Many CFOs do, and it’s costing them in fees.”). This part should ideally tie into a higher-level motivation if possible – think back to human motivators (saving money, growing revenue, reducing hassle, looking good to their boss, etc.). If you nail this, the reader is hooked because you’re talking about their life, not your product. 4. Why You (Be the Trusted Guide): Once the problem is stated, add a line or two that connects you/your solution to that problem. This is not a full pitch, just a teaser of credibility or value. Examples: “I spent the last 5 years helping SaaS companies streamline that exact process, and I have a few ideas for you,” or “We developed a tool after seeing this issue at dozens of firms; not saying it’s magic, but it could save you ~20 hours a month based on our data.” Keep it humble and factual. You just want them to think, “Okay, this person might actually know how to help with this.” If you have a relevant social proof (“helped similar org”), use it briefly. If not, lean on the fact you’ve studied the issue deeply (which you have, in step 1). 5. Engage, Don’t Preach (Optional Vulnerability): Rather than lecturing or dumping a brochure, consider engaging them with a question or even a request for their insight. For instance: “I have a 1-page gameplan that could potentially cut those payment fees by 30%. Mind if I send it over for your thoughts?” or “Am I off base to think this might be a priority for you this quarter?” This invites them into a conversation. It shows you value their perspective. If appropriate, ask for help or validation as discussed earlier. E.g. “We’re actually finalizing a report on this trend – would love your take on whether these findings reflect reality for you.” This can be the hook that turns a monologue into a dialogue. 6. Why Now (Call to Action with Context): Close out with a light call to action that incorporates “why now”. This could be as simple as, “If this is timely, I’d be happy to share ideas while they’re fresh – up for a 15-minute chat next week?” or “Given your upcoming expansion, I thought now might be a good time to connect. Should we talk?” The CTA should feel natural and low-pressure. Often I’ll literally say, “No rush on this, but if it’s worth discussing, I can make time.” It’s paradoxical, but giving them an out (“no rush”) can reduce pressure and actually prompt a quicker response. The key is you provided a reason in the context of their situation that nudges them toward sooner rather than later. 7. Keep It Short and Skimmable: Overall, ensure the email isn’t too long. 2-3 short paragraphs or a few bullet points are fine. Use line breaks and maybe bold a key phrase (sparingly) if it helps highlight the core idea. Remember, many will read on mobile. They should be able to scan and get the gist in under 30 seconds. If you find the email running long, cut the fluff – not the insight. I often remove adjectives, remove any corporate-speak, and make sure every sentence either establishes relevance or provides value. No wasted words. 8. Tone Check – Friendly and Trustworthy: Before sending, read it out loud. Does it sound like a human talking to another human? It should be polite and respectful, but not stiff. Aim for a tone of a trusted advisor or a colleague, not a salesperson on a script. Also double-check for any unintended tone issues. (This is where AI can help: ask it to make the tone friendlier or more concise as needed.) 9. Proofread (or AI-fix) for Professionalism: While grammar isn’t the star of the show, you still don’t want careless mistakes undermining your credibility. Run a spellcheck or have AI quickly proofread. Make sure names and company info are correct (nothing kills trust faster than misspelling the prospect’s name or referring to the wrong company!). This is a sanity step – it should take 1 minute, because you didn’t write a novel, you wrote a tight, focused email. 10. Always Be Learning: Finally, treat each outreach as an experiment. If something gets a positive reply, save it as a mini-template (not to spam, but to reuse the structure or wording that worked). If something bombs, analyze why – was the “Why Care” off target? Did it maybe trigger a defensive reaction? The beautiful thing about modern outreach is we can get data on what resonates. So build your own playbook over time. Using this kind of framework, my teams have consistently seen higher response rates and more meaningful conversations with target accounts. It’s not magic – it’s just about discipline in focusing on the prospect’s needs and following through with clear, valuable writing. It’s a checklist that forces you to empathize with the reader at each step, which is ultimately the secret sauce of successful ABM outreach. After 20+ years and countless campaigns, I can say this with confidence: the emails and messages that have opened doors and forged partnerships were rarely the prettiest or wittiest. They were the ones that spoke to a real problem, offered a thoughtful perspective, and treated the recipient like a person, not a pitch target. If you remember nothing else, remember this: It’s not about you or your product – it’s about them. Show them you get them. Offer a nugget of value. Be human. Do that, and you can get away with an awkward phrase or a typo here or there, because the reader’s already hooked on what you’re saying. In today’s world, where everyone’s inundated with automated messages and templated outreach, authenticity stands out. Personalization isn’t just using {FirstName}; it’s demonstrating you actually did your homework and you care about their context. Trust is earned when you consistently put the prospect’s interests first, even if it means being vulnerable or not immediately pushing the sale. Ironically, that’s what often leads to the sale – because people buy from those they trust and value.
