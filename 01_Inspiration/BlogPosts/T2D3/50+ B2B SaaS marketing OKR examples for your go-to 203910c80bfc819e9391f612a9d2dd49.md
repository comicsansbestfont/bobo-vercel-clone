If you're anything like me, you like examples to reference as a starting point. Sometimes all it takes is a little nomenclature to help you get on a roll. The sample OKRs in this article have been tried-and-tested in our own marketing engagements at Kalungi. If you're new to OKRs and looking for additional best practices for setting them up, check out my other article on the fundamentals of OKRs, and my article on how to match OKRs with your marketing team's capabilities. If you're looking for OKRs that aren't listed here, feel free to suggest another (B2B SaaS marketing) discipline and I'll continue updating this blog with more examples.
