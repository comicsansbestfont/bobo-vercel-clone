We all hit a point in our career where we start interacting with C-level execs
more often. But we don't _really_ know how to operate at an exec-level yet.

So a lot of us (myself included) do this weird thing:

We stop acting like ourselves, and we start talking in long sentences, with
big words.

Like weâre on some BBC TV show about the 1800âs.

(This is semi-embarrassing to admit... but a CRO, whose third language is
English, recently stopped a meeting between him, me, and his CEO because I
used the word âanalogous,â and he told me straight up, âI have no idea
what youâre trying to say.â I was under-prepared for the meeting, talking
fast, and trying to compensate for it.)

We make things overly complex because it _seems_ like what we bring up to the
"top" has to match the âweightâ of a big title.

**But thatâs the _opposite_ of how executives operate.**

Complexity _is_ a weight, but weights sink to the bottom. _Simplicity_ floats
to the top. And it's the mark of seasoned sellers and operators:

People who understand a topic so well, they can communicate it with short
soundbites, not slides.

While I canât hand you a few decades of operating experience, what I can do
is give you a few frameworks to help you think and talk at an exec level, by
first _writing_ for execs.

## The 1-Page Business Case

Every framework in this write-up rises and falls on [this business
case](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-one-page-business-case).

Start this one first, and youâll have the ingredients you need for every
other:

Why start here?

Because it compresses all your [discovery with the buying
team](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-build-test-loop-how-to-create-an-
insanely-committed-champion-while-co-creating-business-cases), and [the
customerâs full buying journey](https://www.fluint.io/resource-
content/introducing-sales-process-2-0-rewriting-the-sales-led-gtm-playbook),
into 1 page that:

  * Preps your own executives for customer conversations.
  * Enables your champion to engage their own execs.

Example: check out how Chris, VP Sales at Idelic, and his team prepped their
own founder on a flight to a customer on-site using this framework.

And used it to win the largest deal in their companyâs history.

Hereâs more on how to write this one, using
[Fluint](/4edea6cc213845318c1f5761f6a4163a?pvs=25) to generate the first
draft:

Thereâs another, 3-part framework Iâve been using lately too:

A classic consulting-style executive summary called the [âSCR Framework.â
Which you can dig into here](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-3-part-business-
case-framework-thatll-make-an-executive-think-theyre-already-paying-you).

^this has a detailed write-up available, so Iâll leave it at that in this
post.

By the way, if you lead a sales team or run enablement/RevOps, and are curious
to embed this approach into your process, letâs

## Pre-Meeting Prep Framework for Executives

By default, our own execs are underprepared to join our customer meetings.
Which is actually _our_ fault as sellers. Not theirs.

So when you need to focus their input in a specific direction, to drive toward
a certain set of meeting outcomes, [use this pre-meeting
brief](https://www.fluint.io/resources/key-account-meeting-brief).

Which also helps align your full internal team:

  * Executives
  * Sales Engineers
  * CS / Implementation
  * Finance / Legal

Pro tip: [attach this to a separate calendar

with your prep notes, alongside the customer invite.

## Three Exec-Level Email Frameworks

A current Fluint customerâs been working to cross-sell Home Depot, and
itâs turning into a highly-competitive deal.

So last month, the AE and VP Sales on the account wrote up a âforwardableâ
email for their CEO to send, and thread in the Home Depot CEO.

They sent me their first draft, âNate can you look at this?â

It was about 2 pages printed out.

So, I fed it as context into the Exec-Level Email framework inside
[Fluint](https://www.fluint.io), made some slight edits, and sent it over.

âHere, try this.â

â¦ a few days later? âWe got the intro!â

Hereâs a set of 3 emails to use:

### Initial, Exec-Level Intro Email

Use this when youâre working to reach out early inside deals, to generate
more upfront momentum:

> < First Name >, our teams have been working on < priority area >.  
>  
> Building a plan to hit < exec-level goal > by < timing >.  
>  
> I was just looking at their write-up, and had a thought to run by you.  
>  
> Plus, itâd be good to connect on < shared interest/connection>, too.  
>  
> Let me know when works to catch up on this?

Some pro-tips for using this:

  1. Ask your exec's assistant for an example email.
  2. Adapt this email to match their tone/style.
  3. Send the email to your exec to copy/send, and CC: their EA on it. To make sure it goes out on time.

### Troubleshooting Deals Mid-Funnel

When I shared this email out recently, [Tom
Lowe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/motewol/) shared an email framework he uses
with his execs. Itâs great for mid-funnel slow-downâs:

> < Exec >,  
>  
> I'm <title> at <your company> â our teams are collaborating on
> <workstream> to help with <strategic goal>.  
>  
> Iâm a little concerned we're <not taking account of x / not aligned on y /
> missing other areas of importance>.  
>  
> Let me know your availability for us to discuss?

Itâs direct, and to the point.

â

### No-Reply Required Follow-Up

Here's a 4-sentence email buying team execs love. Try sharing this in the mid-
funnel, to keep a small slice of mindshare.

Especially during longer or more complex cycles > 90 days.

You can literally write inside it, "no reply needed." (Execs like to be in the
know, but without the burden of an 'ask'.)

> Subject: Update, < Internal Priority >  
>  
> < Executive >, we're making good progress on < priority / problem area >.  
>  
> Surprisingly, <interesting finding / discovery you made with their team>.  
>  
> We also have <shared activity> planned this week, will update you after.

Couple notes overall to keep in mind, too:

  * Execs typically read your emails during other meetings. Or, during early morning and late night workblocks.
  * So if you have something longer (e.g. a 1-page exec summary), try sending in the off hours. The chance it's read goes up.
    * Schedule for 5:30am or 8pm.
  * If youâre sending something mid-day, keep it to ~4 sentences. Again, theyâll read it while multitasking.
  * Even better, write your champions a forwardable email and have them send it, CC'ing you. Execs prioritize internal senders over external senders.
