Hereâs the funny thing about deals that stall mid-funnel:

Iâll bet you have a completely logical reason for why the buying team should
have kept moving forward.

You did all the right things.

Discovery, demos, built out a proposalâ¦ but then, _thatâs_ when the buying
team went dark. Ghosted, as they say.

So when that sure-thing starts to slip, what do you do?

Well, hereâs what the average seller does.

They [send a follow-up email](https://www.fluint.io/resources/mid-funnel-
email-frameworks) reminding their main contacts about [their
timeline](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-build-mutual-action-plans-your-
buyers-actually-follow-through-on). That theyâre behind, and theyâre
reaching out to help get them back on track.

Itâs a fine start.

But after a few more calls and emails, and still nothing? Whatâs next?

## Writing Mid-Funnel Emails like itâs Middle School Science Class

Remember playing with magnets in science class? Youâll probably remember the
classic saying âopposites attract.â

  * The positive side of a magnets sticks to the negative side.
  * Two negative sides of a magnet repel each other.

The same idea applies here.

Except, instead of âpolesâ with a positive or negative charge, weâre
talking about emotionally-charged messaging.

Because most of the time, thatâs the issue when a perfectly-logical deal
slips. An emotional blocker got in the way, like:

**Which brings us to a few questions:**

  1. Whatâs the main negative emotion blocking momentum? If you were to label that emotion with one word, what is it?
  2. Whatâs one word that describes the _opposite,_ positive emotion?
  3. What message can you write to create that positive emotion?

If you can answer these three questions with a thoughtful response?

Youâre more than halfway to a follow-up email thatâll jumpstart your deal
faster than AAA roadside assistance.

## Mid-Funnel Email Rewrite: Before & After Case Study

Hereâs an example.

Using a âreal lifeâ follow-up email a strategic seller from a major design
software sent me from inside [the Fluint Slack
community](https://www.fluint.io/community) last week.

Sheâs been working on a deal that had a solid champion and some real
momentum â until it didnât.

The customer had a âcompelling eventâ with a specific timeline, and her
main champion, Katy, built up support from the product team all around. But
then? Silence.

So, here was her next follow-up email:

Which she wrote with her manager, who encouraged her to:

  * Use âcollaborativeâ language like âourâ kickoff and âweâ discussed.
  * Ask a question about âimpactâ of missed timelines.
  * Reference the June design sprints.

All well-meaning advice.

**But can you spot the big issue here?**

Itâs a ârepellingâ email, because the main emotion this email creates is
âyouâre falling behind.â

And when I asked her what Katy was likely _already_ feeling?

**Overwhelmed.**

Katyâs a rising star, respected, and in demand inside her org. Which made
her a solid champion to start with.

Project requests are always pressing on all sides, which is both stressful and
straight up overwhelming at times.

**So, what happens when you tell an overwhelmed person theyâre falling
further behind?**

They ignore you.

Itâs how they cope, and stay sane.

I mean, heck. Iâd do the same. Wouldnât you?

(Sidenote: yes, even [âtrueâ champions](https://www.fluint.io/resource-
content/the-enterprise-sales-playbook#attributes-behaviors-of-a-champion) will
ignore sellers who are adding to an already stacked and stressful worklife.
Champions arenât champions because theyâre always responsive to you,
regardless of your message.)

So, whatâs the opposite of overwhelmed?

Calm. On top of it, and in control.

Which is _exactly_ the emotion we went for in our re-write. After we answered
the three questions we listed above like this:

  1. Overwhelmed.
  2. On top of it.
  3. Visible progress against goals, a team whoâs already hard at work around you, creating a sense of calm.

Did you catch the shift in language?

  * âFalling behindâ becomes âahead of the game.â
  * âIf weâre not able to confirmâ becomes âweâre already ~45% done.â
  * âHow is that going to affectâ becomes âhas anything changed?â

My rewrite isnât perfect. But itâs definitely more magnetic.

_And it got a same-day reply, with a follow-up call for the next day._

**Looking at these two emails:**

  * Which of the two would you reply to?
  * Which of the two are you writing?

Think on that. And if youâre looking for a little extra help writing more
