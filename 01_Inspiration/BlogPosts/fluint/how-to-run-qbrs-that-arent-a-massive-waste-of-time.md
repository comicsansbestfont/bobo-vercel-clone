Sales team QBRâs are incredibly expensive to run.

And based on how most teams run them, theyâre often a waste.

Itâs kind of like this (a spinoff from [this
concept](https://twitter.com/0xgaut/status/1620815168921038850).)

When you add up the cost of pulling reps and leaders from the field â who
are often among the most expensive resources in the company â youâve got
to be pretty certain of two things:

  1. Every hour of that QBR is truly necessary. You canât cover everything in less time.
  2. Sellers will gain something that leads to specific deals closing, that wouldnât otherwise.

I mean, just think about the last QBR you were at:

Were both of those points true?

Or did that QBR feel more like an overcrowded audit that went something like:

> CRO: âSo, bring us through this deal. Itâs a big one this quarter.â  
>  
> AE: _rambles through some play-by-play commentary_  
>  
> VP Sales: _says something equally designed to impress CRO_  
>  
> AE: _not sure what to say, wanders through more details_  
>  
> Manager: _defends AE so this doesnât reflect poorly on them_  
>  
> CRO: _answers emails, looks up, puts things back on track_ âOkay okay
> okay. So when we meeting their exec?â  
>  
> AE: _another 3 to 12 minutes of semi-relevant context_  
>  
> CRO: _goes back to email_  
>  
> VP Sales: âMake sure youâre selling value, not features.â  
>  
> Manager: âWow, 90 minutes already, we should wrap up huh?

Now, obviously, Iâm exaggerating a little. But it probably not too far off
from some QBRâs youâve been part of.

Hereâs a story, and an alternative agenda, for how QBRâs _should_ go.

## QBRâs that are actually worth the time and money.

Last month, I flew out to join one of our customerâs QBRâs.

Their VP Sales, Christian, asked if I could join them on-site. It was their
first since making a pretty big change in their process:

_Deals canât move past Stage 3 without a documented business case, built
with the customer._

(More on that, [here](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/introducing-
sales-process-2-0-rewriting-the-sales-led-gtm-playbook#mapping-sales-stages-
to-buying-behavior).)

[A simple executive summary](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-one-page-
business-case) focused on the headlines, edited by the buying team.

I slid into the back of the room around 9:00am, two hours after their official
start time, after a morning flight in from Denver.

They had booked a full day at the Hilton, and holed themselves up inside a
conference room with extra tall ceilings, and a crystal chandelier that,
somehow, still looked way too big for the room.

I was standing next to a table lined with dozens of those fancy Voss water
bottles. Almost like the hotel staff knew a steady stream of sellers were
about to sweat through 20oz of water an hour while getting grilled on each
deal, so weâd need plenty of them.

âHowâs it going so far?â I whispered to Christian.

He had seen me slip in, and left his seat to stand next to me.

âSurprisingly well,â he said.

Which got my attention. âWhat do you mean?â I asked.

âWeâre already done with four reps. I thought weâd be running over on
the second right now.â

âWhyâs that?â I smiled. I already had a fairly good idea why.

Iâll detail what Christian shared below, and how you can make your QBRâs
suck less.

But first, hereâs the end of this QBR story:

They wrapped up around 2:30pm â way ahead of schedule â so they all went
to the driving range for the rest of the afternoon, while I caught an early
flight back to Denver.

(Iâll take getting home to dinner with my daughter any day.)

## Your Next QBR Agenda

The key to running a QBR like this is the big point I referenced earlier:

_Christianâs team already had their QBR prep done just by_[ _running their
sales process_](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Run-QBR-s-That-Aren-t-a-Massive-
Waste-of-Time-fe9867d076304e7f9d671e42ba318c29?pvs=21) _._

There wasnât anything extra to create.

_Because your business case is your deal._

It has the majority of what sales leaders need to know, and can [clearly read
in ~1 minute](https://www.fluint.io/post/minute-to-win-it-the-60-second-deal-
review-thats-scary-accurate).

Itâs one page that captures the âevidenceâ of whatâs actually
happening inside the buying team â and whatâs not. Whoâs involved in the
deal? Which business priority are you attached to? And how deep have you gone
in discovery?

Hereâs how Christian approached it, and you can too:

### Pre-QBR Prep

  * Christian sent a Google Drive link with sub-folders with each repâs name out 1 week early.
  * Reps saved PDFâs of business cases they were working on [inside Fluint](https://www.notion.so/Fluint-HQ-5b3e432cec9c474995c06dc57dd4eae0?pvs=21) to their folder.  
(Note: we also add this content to your CRM, so you can make a report vs.
folders like this.)

  * Leadership scanned the deals that were most interesting on the plane ride over.
  * Reps self-scored deal based on [their business case scorecard](https://www.fluint.io/resources/business-case-scorecard) to find gaps.
  * Reps prepped with 3 âasksâ to make of the GTM team.

### **During the QBR**

The team prioritized deals for discussion based on:

  1. High-value contracts with low deal scores.
  2. Late-stage contracts with any deal score.
  3. High-scoring deals others should learn from.

Reps started off which a quick summary statement, like this:

> **Summary:** Â Iâve closed $_____ quarter-to-date, compared to quota of
> $_______.  
>  
> Including this, Iâm expecting to end with:  
> â  
> Worst Case: $**,** if [conditions for this scenario].  
> Base Case: $, if [conditions for this scenario].  
> Best Case: $______, if [conditions for this scenario].

Deals in that first category are often the difference between a sellerâs
best case vs. base case.

So, thatâs where the discussion started. Which went something like this:

  * Leaders spent a minute re-reading the business case.
  * They asked clarifying questions for more context as needed.
  * Reps moved into their asks:  
e.g. âThis is a rip-and-replace, and the customerâs nervous about a second
failed rollout. I need CS / prof services time in a meeting on < Date > to
join me andâ¦â

  * Leaders would spend a meeting _actually executing_ on that ask.  
e.g. email a CS leader, âHey, we need to prioritize some support for < Rep >
next week, theyâll send a calendar invite â hereâs the doc with
context.â

  * Theyâd move to the next.

### Compare & Contrast Two Different Deals

When you pick up a business case, you can get pretty clear signal on topics
like the âBig 3.â

â Names, numbers, and dates.

Which are part of the [overall
scorecard](https://www.fluint.io/resources/business-case-scorecard), and will
tell you with reasonable certainty if a dealâs on track. For example:

  * Do we have a written problem statement built with the buying teamâs own numbers?
  * Do we have multiple comments / edits from the buying team, confirming our POV?
  * Did the buying team exec fund a project or internal initiative to do _something_?  
Do we know that internal project name and team?

  * Did the project team set a specific go-live date that, if missed, means a worse outcome?

Hereâs an example of what I mean.

Letâs say you pull up the business case behind deal #1, and it looks like
this:

What does that tell you about the deal?

Now, letâs say you pull up a doc like this. What does it tell you?

You can see:

  * A sharp headline tied back to the customerâs internal priority.
  * A quote setting up the issue from a comment on a recent investor call.
  * A POV on the fact certain brands in the Gap portfolio are underperforming, with detailed numbers from inside the buying team.
  * Open questions labeled with Xâs, waiting for more input from the buying team.

How are you feeling about that deal?

This is the big difference between the typical QBR, and how you _could be_
running QBRâs. By designing a sales process that creates written
âevidenceâ of where the dealâs at:
