The more you write, the more youâll sell.

Writing packages your message so _champions_ can deliver it. During internal
buying conversations, when decisions are being made. And youâre not in the
room.

This is _all_ that matters.

Here are 10 steps for writing well:

(1)Â Â Write how your buyers talk. Use their words.

(2)Â Â Start with a good framework. Then add in your buyerâs words. See #1.

(3)Â Â Narrative structures are a better internal script for champions. Slides
are awkward.

(4)Â Â Shrink your writing to 1 page. If you canât, you donât yet know
what you want to say.

(5)Â Â Noise is the enemy.

(6)Â Â Template emails and product decks are noise. Champions donât use
them. See #5.

(7)Â Â Cut out your branding. A trustworthy format is the customerâs font on
a white page.

(8)Â Â Ghostwrite. Make champions your authors, and list their names on your
docs.

(9)Â Â Your ROI is a maybe. Their problemâs cost is a fact. Always start
with the facts.

(10)Â Write headlines customers will copy & paste into a board deck or press
release.
