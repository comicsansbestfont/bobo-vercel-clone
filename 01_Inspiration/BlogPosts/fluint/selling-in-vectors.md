This post will combine a few different ideas from this blog into a single
concept.

Tying together this set of realities that are at work, in all your deals:

The concept? Selling in âvectors.â Which comes from this quote by Elon
Musk:

> _Every person in your company is a vector. Your progress is determined by
> the sum of all vectors._

â

## Every Contact in Your Deal is a Vector

To start, a vector is something that has both magnitude _and_ direction.

Vector addition says that when two or more vectors are added together, where
and how far they move always depends on:

  1. How well aligned are the vectors? Are they all headed in the same direction?
  2. Which direction are the _strongest_ vectors pointing?

For example, letâs say we have one vector thatâs 3 âunitsâ strong, and
another thatâs 7.

If theyâre perfectly aligned, then together, they can move 10 units forward:

If theyâre not, theyâll offset each other:

So you can see just how important alignment is. **Every vector needs to be
moving in the same direction to make any real progress.**  
â

## How to Sell in Vectors

We can build on this concept with the idea that selling is simply moving a
buying team from where they are today (a problem), to where they want to go
tomorrow (a payoff).

Which combines the two elements of a vector:

  1. **Direction.** Everyone has a (conflicting) opinion about the right way to work. Executive priorities set the destination, but project teams have to figure out the way to get there.   

The tricky part is [the path to get there](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-
ask-better-questions-a-roadmap-for-more-powerful-
discovery#:~:text=your%20discovery%20roadmap%3A) is rarely linear â [it
often curves and backtracks](https://www.fluint.io/post/designing-a-sale-
around-buying-behaviors-two-shifts-that-win-
deals#:~:text=Buying%20isn%E2%80%99t%20linear.%20So%20complex%20selling%20isn%E2%80%99t%2C%20either)
âÂ which is what makes complex deals, complex.  
â

  2. **Magnitude** , or strength, is determined by influence. And influence isnât found in someoneâs title or the corporate hierarchy. People build varying levels of trust, social capital, and internal reputations over time. This affects how theyâre seen and heard.  

Which means two different people can say the exact same thing, and get
drastically different results. One contact will be able to take a project the
distance and make fast progress. AnotherÂ will struggle to create any forward
progress at all.  
â

**Now, letâs apply this to an example of a project team.**

Each contact has direction and magnitude (if you skipped it, see above for
definitions):

**For a small and low-risk project, we might be able to get a deal done with
this group.**

Letâs say the distance between where they are and want to go = 15 "units"
because:

  * Weâre optimizing a process, not changing it.
  * We need < 2 weeks of time and people to implement.
  * Only an incremental outcome is needed to justify a small expense.

In this case, hereâs how the group will come together:

**But now, letâs say the project means moving the company forward by at
least 30 "units."**

Itâs a more transformational project that requires:

  * Changing behavior to align with a brand new process.
  * 3 - 4 months of implementation, rollout, and training.
  * Serious financial investment over at least 3 years.

The groupâs going to fail to get this job done:

So the question, then, how do we align all vectors in our deal?

And how do you get the highest-influence vectors pointing in your direction?

## 6 Practices for Selling in Vectors

â

### 1\. Craft a written, exec-level narrative.

Narratives set direction. Executives use them to communicate where they want
to go and why, to get their people aligned. Doing this in _written_ form
will:Â

  1. Let people react to something specific and concrete.
  2. Focus the project teamâs internal conversations.
  3. Keep everyone in sync.

â

### 2\. Compress your narrative into a short soundbite.

Repetition is persuasive. Make sure you can distill that page-length narrative
into [a sentence or two soundbite](https://www.fluint.io/post/selling-in-
soundbites-how-to-sell-more-by-saying-less). One thatâs easy to share and
say again, and again.

The more often itâs repeated, the more youâll start to shift peopleâs
direction.

â

### 3\. Get the _right_ contacts to spread that soundbite.

This is where multithreading to curate the *[right* buying
committee](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-multithread-navigate-
dysfunctional-buying-groups-in-enterprise-
sales#:~:text=2/%20Handpick%20the%20Buying%20Team%20With%20Your%20Champions)
comes in. While designing the flow of internal communication, based on the
â[shadow org chart](https://henrysward.medium.com/the-shadow-org-chart-
cfcdd644575f).â

â

### 4\. Invite disagreement in discovery.

Someone always has a different opinion. So donât leave your champions to
sand down that friction alone. Instead, try asking:

> _Is there someone on your team who you think might be willing to disagree
> with us, so we can be sure we have a good fit?_

The key to this phrasing is â _willing_ _to disagree_.â

Youâre asking for a nomination. And guess who ends up filling the role? The
strongest critic.

###  
5\. Keep people moving forward with a joint plan.

This is largely something youâll be managing, as a service to your
champions.

Designing and managing an effect sequence of events to keep everyone aligned
in the back half of a deal is your job as âproject manager.â

[Hereâs a deep dive on this](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-build-mutual-
action-plans-your-buyers-actually-follow-through-on).

â

### 6\. Think of your internal deal team as vectors.

Need something thatâs a little unique or custom to accommodate the customer?

CS to change up the standard set of services? Finance to signoff on unique
terms?

Product to align roadmap with a needed but missing feature?

Yep. All the contacts involved in this are vectors, with strength and
direction Â impacting your deal.

## 7 Vector-Based Questions for Deal Reviews

The next time you're walking into a deal review, try adding these questions
into the mix:

**Questions About "Direction"**

  * Who's working against the deal? What do they know that we don't, or believe that we haven't spoken to?  
â

  * What projects/priorities are pulling our contacts in a different direction?  
â

  * Where, exactly, are people falling out of alignment? Is everyone even thinking about the problem in the same way?  
â

  * What's the mutual success plan / sequence of events we need everyone to stay aligned with?  
â

**Questions About "Magnitude"**

  * Which direction are the highest-influence vectors pointing? Towards us? A competitor? Or a different approach all together?  
â

  * Who has a level of "social capital" that's incongruent with their title? Manager-level contacts we overlooked? VP level contacts we're wasting time with?  
â

  * What's the narrative we're creating for our high-influence contacts to share? Are we enabling them with the right message?

â

## Short Case Study: âCheck out this call recording.â

One of my favorite moments in a deal is when champions will record an internal
meeting, then share the recording after. So I can listen to and learn from the
conversation.

It takes a high level of trust, for sure.

But they love doing it, because then, I can fold any questions or concerns
raised into our business case.**Â**

For example, I recently listened to an internal recording for one deal Iâm
actively working on right now. There were a few different vectors in play:

  * Two of the teamâs top sellers were strongly aligned with [Fluint](http://www.fluint.io).  

They were in lockstep, going back and forth answering questions from the Head
of Global Enablement, point her in the same direction.

  * Their VP joined in halfway through the call, and started outlining why he believes Fluint aligns with the direction their CRO set around value selling.  

Which added a higher degree of influence or âmagnitudeâ into the
conversation.

  * One of the takeaways at the end was deciding to connect me with their âValue Managementâ team.  

Which is another set of contacts we can help. Value teams love us, because
Fluint takes away the manual work to create the "inputs" for a business case.  

But without extra context, they might see us as competitive, and _start moving
the deal in the opposite direction_. Even though we want move them forward.

## Creating Content to Make it All Work

The one practice that ties all of these steps together?

**Creating high-quality deal content:**

  * Internal briefs to align your internal deal team
  * Mutual actions plans to keep people on schedule
  * A narratively-structured business case that speaks to execs
  * Forwardable emails with short soundbites from the buying team

Which is why Fluint gives every single one of your deals a workspace, that
[generates each piece of content](https://www.fluint.io/how-it-works) across
the buyer's journey.Â
