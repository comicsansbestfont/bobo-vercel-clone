Reps who can communicate more while saying less, win.

So I want to introduce you to the idea of âselling in soundbites.â

Shrinking your entire sales cycle into [1
page](https://www.fluint.io/resources/interactive-guide-the-1-page-business-
case). Then 1 paragraph. Then, 1 sentence.

But not just any sentence. The _right_ sentence.

## 1 Sentence, 3 Years

Let me give you an example:

> _Our express lane in the race to become the nextgenâs go-to._

That sentence generated one of our biggest deals âÂ a 3-year contract.

And it probably means nothing to you.

But to the CMO of a major credit card? It said everything she needed to hear:

  * Races have a ticking clock. Acting now is important.  
â

  * âNextgenâ was an internal phrase. Referring to a changing customer base.  
â

  * Context to those changes: 52% of the Fortune 500âs from the year 2000 donât exist anymore. They used to be their biggest customers. On top of those customers folding, a competitive company was quickly signing emerging tech companies as their customers. (Stealing the "next generation" of customers.)  
â

  * Races have winners and losers. Would it be them? The âexpress laneâ (our offering) was the way to win. Fast.

Keep all of this in mind for a second. Hereâs how I think about the
qualities of good soundbites:

> **Quality Soundbites = Sticky + Shareable + Simple**

Letâs break that down.  
â

### 1/ Create Sticky Sentences

You know what doesnât stick? Long decks and demos.

We donât remember them. But we do remember short sentences.

Specifically, sentences that fit with the stories weâre already telling:

_âThe fate of a memory is mostly determined by how much it means to usâ¦ We
donât try to remember physics equations for the sake of it, but rather
because in our personal narrative, we are someone who knows a lot about
physics.â_
([Source](https://www.notion.so/11e4a678aaf742d0a0a4dc486801a035?pvs=21))

Thatâs why this soundbite about the ânextgenâ stuck. CMOâs see
themselves as legacy builders.

They create enduring brands. Theyâre not people who fade into irrelevance.  
â

### 2/ Create Shareable Sentences

Repetition is persuasive. So you need buying teams to share your message over,
and over.

Especially when youâre not in the room.

Hereâs an example from [Matthew
Rogers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAA6GEPoBgEy9GyjFtBaolCWBjlm8A3sNYUQ),
a Fluint user who texted last week:

> _âThe guy I talked to on Friday had never spoken to me, but he recited,
> almost verbatim, the 1-page business case I drafted months ago.â_

That is HUGE. And it means:

  * His message was sticky. Months later, people remembered.
  * It was shared so wide, it spread to contacts heâd never met.

So, how do you make your message shareable? Focus on:

Youâll know you've done it when people you never met can recite your
message.

So when people I hadnât met before called us the âexpress lane,â IÂ knew
we were in a good spot.  
â

### 3/ CreateÂ Simple Sentences

Simplicity is complexity resolved, not ignored. (Constantin Brancusi)

So simple sentences arenât "dumbed down." But they are easy to understand.

And the easiest ideas to understand fit alongside our existing â[mental
models](https://www.fluint.io/post/trust-based-selling-how-to-manage-this-
hidden-pipeline-metric).â

Venkatesh Rao explains why this matters in his book, **_Tempo:_**

> _Mental models exhibit momentum like physical objects. Just as physical
> objects have mass and velocity, our mental models gather meaning and
> coherence over time, making them hard to change suddenly. This explains why
> deeply held beliefs or organizational cultures resist rapid change. Their
> mental momentum must be overcome._

He goes on to say later:

> _Narrative rationality is the ability to think, make decisions, and act in
> ways that make sense with respect to the most compelling and elegant story
> that you can improviseâ¦_

This is particularly relevant for enterprise sellers.

**When people face a complex problem, they rely on narratives.**

Which is fundamentally different from âcalculative rationality.â

  * Calculative rationality = cold logic, running the numbers.
  * Narrative rationality = relying on âmental modelsâ built on stories and analogies.

So how do you tap into ânarrative rationality?â

**You create what Rao calls a âcheap trick.â A short story, in the form of
an analogy.**

Analogies create leverage. A few words can carry the weight of a whole deck.

âExpress laneâ was my analogy in this case. It fit the feeling they were
in a race. (It also highlighted our value:Â curated introâs vs. just a
database like Crunchbase.)

Plus, it tapped into one more idea from Raoâs research on narratives: Every
narrative has a âtempo.â

**Itâs very hard to set or change tempo. So âTempo Matchingâ is key when
crafting soundbites:**

  * If an executive is under pressure to cut costs, focus on fast, upfront savings. Donât talk about âtotal cost of ownershipâ or long-term ROI.  
â

  * "Express lane" matched the CMOâs race tempo. (And it was a play on their name.)  
â

  * Compare that to a deal Iâm working on now:   

The CEO's goal is to âprotect" cash and âpreserve" revenue. So my champion
and I are framed Fluint around securing renewals. Preserving whatâs theirs
vs. accelerating growth.

## From 1 Sentence, to 1 Word

Think you could beat out every competitor with just one word?

Here's a fascinating case study, showing it can be done.

It's from the architect behind the Sydney Opera House, JÃ¸rn Utzon.

**He sold his design to the planning committeeÂ using just four letters:
"Sail."**

If youâve seen a picture of the Opera House, itâs iconic. It sits right on
the water and is most often photographed with boats sailing by. Â

So once the committee saw the design and had the word âsailâ in their
minds, Utzon was in a league of his ownâeven though, technically speaking,
nobody knew how to actually build it.

## Now, It's Your Turn

Hereâs the related exercise, to help compress your message into a soundbite:

1/ Start by writing out a concise recommendation:

> < Buying team > should < take this recommended action > by < timing >. This
> will result in < an exec-level outcome >, while avoiding < cost of the
> status quo > created by < problem statement >.

2/Â Compress that headline into a sentence:

> Unlock < desired outcome > and avoid < cost of the problem >.

3/ Now, if you're up for it, compress that sentence into a single word.  

And hereâs the thing â your word has to be different for each account.
JÃ¸rn Utzon couldnât re-use âSailâ for any other project. That's why it
worked so well.
