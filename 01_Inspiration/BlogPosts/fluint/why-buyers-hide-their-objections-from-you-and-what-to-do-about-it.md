Objections are part of every deal. Whether youâre part of resolving them, or
not.

Theyâre like that old arcade game, Whack-a-Mole. Always lurking just below
the surface.

Then they pop up all of a sudden and reps âhandleâ them. They knock them
down, fast, lest they derail the deal. But most reps donât realize handling
objections is **counterproductive**.**  
â**

## Why Buyers Hide Their Objections From You

Iâm not sure about you, but I donât like to feel âhandled.â Advised or
informed, educated or enlightened, sure. But not handled.

So when a rep thinks theyâre removing deal risk by flattening an objection,
from the buyerâs perspective, theyâre actually:  
â

  1. **Increasing sales resistance.  
â**When we feel someone pushing back on us (even if theyâre right), we
brace ourselves. We dig our heels in and cling to our original position.  
â

  2. **Teaching buyers to duck nâ cover.  
â**Letting someone else see our FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) is a
vulnerable thing. Thatâs especially true when our FUD is rooted in our
reputation, identity, or job security.  

So if a buyer feels like theyâve been whacked over the head by a rehearsed
and eager response, they learn to duck nâ cover. They retreat and have no
interest in exposing another objection again.  
â

  3. **Creating âemotional debt.â  
â**When a rep is dismissive, aggressive, or ambivalent, theyâre making a
withdrawal from the relationship. Make too many withdrawals, and you go into
debt. âEmotional debt,â just like financial debt, compounds. It stacks up
faster than youâre able to pay it down.  

Thatâs because objections live in the land of FUD. They make for
emotionally-charged moments. Since weâre primed to recall feelings, not
facts, these moments are weighed more heavily in the buyerâs mind. Theyâre
what defines the buyerâs memory of their sales experience. This is also why
the number of objections you hear directly relates to the [trust youâve
built](https://www.fluint.io/post/trust-based-selling-how-to-manage-this-
hidden-pipeline-metric).

Taking these points together, qualified-but-closed-lost deals are often tied
back to the times when a seller tried to handle objections.

## How to Unpack Objections _With_ Your Buyers

Thereâs a 3-part framework you can use called **Understand-Unpack-Respond.**
Before digging into that framework, know thereâs a difference between
**objections and questions.**

Itâs not uncommon that what seems like an objection to a seller, is just a
simple question in the buyerâs mind. Theyâre asking because something you
communicated was:

  1. **Missing.** You didnât share all the information your buyer needs. It was incomplete.
  2. **Misunderstood.** You did share, but your buyer didnât follow you.

This will often sound like:  
â

> Prospect: Thanks again for the demo. Unfortunately, this doesnât have what
> we need.

> AE: Thanks again for joining, too. Do you mind me asking, when you mentioned
> candidate screening was important to you, was I understanding that your goal
> is to focus your hiring managersâ time on more vetted candidates?

> Prospect: Yeah, thatâs right.

> AE: Got it. Was there something about screening you need, but didnât see
> today?

> Prospect: Yeah, it didnât look like there was much screening happening on
> the demo. It was more a simple yes/no filter. Nothing more advanced than
> what we already have.

> AE: Ah, Iâm so sorry I didnât communicate this. I only had one candidate
> dimension set, without our âsmart filtersâ on, to keep it simple. Would
> you like to see how these work?

Now, to the framework.

## Step 1: Understand Deeply.

Objection handling involves matching a planned response to a routine prompt.
Itâs kind of like an âIFâ statement in an Excel sheet.

  * IF objection relates to pricing, THEN reinforce ROI.
  * IF objection relates to implementation, THEN point out NPS scores.

Which leads to sellers making statements. Instead of asking questions. Which
leads to a shallow understanding of the true âthing behind the thingâ
driving the objection.

So step one, âUnderstand,â starts by listening for whatâs not being
said.

### âTug on the threadâ to unravel the real objection.

When someone first raises an objection, they debate how much to reveal on a
spectrum of:

Secrecy < âââââ > Transparency

Often, their first objection is just testing the waters. Theyâll give you a
fraction of the full story, keeping the rest behind the curtain. Their
objection will fall here:

Secrecy < Xââââ > Transparency

**When this happens, keep tugging on the thread until youâve unraveled the
full story.**

Thereâs typically a second, third, or fourth order concern behind it. As you
dig into those next-order concerns, youâre moving further to the right on
this spectrum:

Secrecy < ââââX > Transparency

**Hereâs an example.**

  1. âThis seems expensive.â
  2. âThis is more expensive than my $50K approval limit.â
  3. âI told them I could approve this, and donât want to admit I canât.â
  4. âIâm anxious Iâll never be promoted into a leadership role where I matter.â

**In this example:**

  * â**Handling** â the objection means talking about the insane ROI youâll create.
  * â**Tugging** â on the objection means telling a story about a past deal champion, who was just promoted after leading a company-wide rollout.

By the way, this step starts but doesnât end here. It continues throughout
step two as well.  
â

## Step 2: Unpack the Pieces.

Objections often works like a pair of wired headphones that you stuffed into
your pocket. They come out as a tangled mess, with different yet connected
pieces.

This is where the art of thoughtful discovery continues.

### The art of asking thoughtful questions.

Your goal here is to unpack the different pieces to an objection before
responding.

For example, you might ask:  
â

> âSo thereâs no scenario where this approach could be helpful?â

> "When this topic comes up, typically, itâs because of X, or Y. Is either
> the case here?"*

âConnectiveâ questions are another effective way to do this. They start by
saying:  
â

>  _When you sharedâ¦ was that related toâ¦?_

> _So how does this compare to when you said...?_

> _This sounds like when youâ¦_

**  
Hereâs a simplified example of how this sounds. Letâs say you sell to
marketing teams:  
â**

> Prospect: âWeâll be in a tough spot if the inbound leads weâre
> generating drops, and I donât see this helping us drive up lead volume.â

> AE: âInteresting, is the focus on lead volume related to the sales team
> hiring you mentioned?â

> Prospect: âRight. Itâs a part of why weâre focused on more marketing-
> sourced pipeline.â

> AE: âGot it. And your comment about slow rep ramp times, does that play
> into it?â

> Prospect: âYeah, sales is focused on adding more fully-ramped reps. Which
> means we need to deliver more leads for them, to help everyone hit our team
> goals.â

> AE: âIs lead quality not part of the picture then?â

> Prospect: âWell, kind of. It affects the lead-to-opportunity
> conversion.â

> AE: âWhich is part of the marketing-sourced pipeline goal you were just
> talking about?â

> Prospect: âExactly. So if volume drops, but we have better conversions, we
> could probably still hit our pipeline goal.â

> AE: âWould the sales team be okay with that approach?â

> Prospect: âActually, theyâd probably prefer it. Easier to handle less
> but higher-quality leads while new reps are ramping up. So I guess our goal
> is really about lead quality.â

Now, is every convo this seamless? No. Definitely not.

But you can see the contrast to an immediate âhandleâ like:  
â

> â _Instead of focusing on lead volume, weâll 3X your marketing funnel
> with our AI-enabled prospecter, which matches your ideal customer profile to
> second-party data sources to boost conversion rates.â_

â

## Step 3: Respond Gracefully.

Now that you understand âthe thing behind the thing,â and unpacked all the
objectionâs pieces, youâre ready to respond. Here are three methods you
can use, depending on the conversation.

### Back up one level to call out assumptions.

Most objections come with a set of built-in assumptions. It may be that your
buyer hasnât stepped back to unpack or question the **higher-level beliefs
theyâre taking as a given**.

You typically see this in product-focused objections where an approach has
already been decided, but not communicated or questioned.

**This sounds like:  
â**

> Prospect: Thanks, these sequences and campaigns look good, but I didnât
> realize this doesnât have a built-in dialer, so I donât think this is
> going to be a fit.

> AE: Sounds like youâre focused on an all-in-one solution then?

> Prospect: Thatâs right.

> AE: And you mentioned most new meetings your team is booking are from cold
> calls, right?

> Prospect: Yes, also right.

> AE: Gotcha. Something to consider, then: all-in-one solutions sacrifice
> deeper functionality for ease, and a wider range of features.

> So while you work to add in email and social campaigns, have you looked at
> what functionality your sellers rely on today, but youâll have to
> sacrifice with an all-in-one?

> Prospect: Not yet, I guess I havenât looked into the tradeoffs.

> AE: Well if youâd be open to exploring using two point solutions, then
> Iâll show you how other dialers integrate with us. That way, your sellers
> can keep everything they need for calling.

The point here: an all-in-one approach is an assumption. **Itâs the
foundation to the objection.** Instead of going deep into a feature
comparison, back up a level and speak to the premise.  
â

### Introduce more complexity to the conversation.

This is a bit of a weird one because, typically, simplicity is a gift.
Complexity is bad.

But addressing an objection can involve **pointing out the nuance that exists
in a decision**. To create a more open mind, and disrupt unhealthy levels of
over-confidence.

Adam Grant puts it this way in his book (which I highly recommend) _Think
Again:  
â_

>  _A dose of complexity can disrupt overconfidence cycles and spur rethinking
> cycles. It gives us more humility about our knowledge and more doubts about
> our opinions, and it can make us curious enough to discover information we
> were lacking._

Hereâs how this will sound:  
â

>  _âGot it. Well, if youâre looking to maximize Xâ¦ then youâll want
> to focus onâ¦ but if your goal is Yâ¦ then actually, youâll need
> toâ¦â_

**  
This approach also re-introduces a sense of choice and control to the buyer.**

Youâre allowing them to opt for the path they believe is right. A second,
related quote from _Think Again_ talks about the fact that all persuasion is
self-persuasion:  
â

>  _âI gave them reason to think about their direction in life, and they
> thought about it, and thought, âI need a better path, and this is the way
> to go.ââ_

â

### Step back to enable a separate, internal conversation.

Finally, when youâre working with a large buying committee, the group will
tend to funnel their objections through one person. Itâs common for that
person to proactively raise an objection they _think_ the group will bring up,
too:  
â

> â _I know Caseyâs going to be nervous about X, so let find out more.â_

**  
In this case, shift your posture from selling _to_ your buyer, to selling
_with_ them. Show them how to communicate with the committee when youâre not
around.**

This is critical, because skeptics are powerful. They can tip the decision
scales quickly, and their concerns carry more weight than the benefits your
champions are advocating for.

Plus, itâs easier for skeptics to withhold objections during sales
conversations. Theyâre most likely to share them during an internal
conversation thatâs happening about you, without you.

**Hereâs an example of how this will sound:  
â**

>  _Buyer: It seems like the implementation process is going to be pretty
> distracting._

> _AE: From our last conversation, it sounded like Casey, not you, would be
> running point during the setup process. Is that still the case?_

> _Buyer: Right, Iâm not going to be involved very much during the first few
> weeks._

> _AE: Gotcha. I can see how, from Caseyâs perspective, this will feel like
> a distraction, while youâre feeling excited for everything that comes
> after. If I was part of your next conversation Casey, hereâs what Iâd
> want her to know._

> _â¦.._

> _By the way, the word âdistractionâ makes me think Casey may not fully
> see the link between this project, and the priority Juan [Caseyâs boss]
> already set. So Iâd communicateâ¦_

Hereâs a visual of what this looks like:

**When you use the Understand-Unpack-Respond framework, tone and posture are
key.**

Hereâs one last illustration on why.

Thereâs a bunch of prairie dogs that live on a trail by my house. When Iâm
running, they duck into their holes. But if I slow down and walk calmly, they
come out. They realize Iâm not a threat.

**Effective sellers create an equally calm presence, to bring objections into
the daylight.** They donât let their own fear of losing a deal lead to
quickly eliminating the "threat" of an objection.
