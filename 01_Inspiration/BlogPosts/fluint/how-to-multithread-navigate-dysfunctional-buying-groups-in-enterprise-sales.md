Deals hanging by a single thread are risky. I know this. You know this.
Everybody knows multithreading is a must.

Gong has good [data](https://www.gong.io/blog/army-of-champions-is-must-now-
theres-data-to-prove-it/) to back this up, too:Â Closed-won deals involve 3X
the number of people than lost deals.

Thereâs another thread to this conversation we often miss, however.

We spotlight multithreading as a must-do, while ignoring its shadow. The dark
side and the dysfunction thatâsÂ always part of selling to large buying
groups.

**In other words, multithreading isnât risk free either. There are _wrong_
ways to multithread. Ways that createÂ more deal risk like:**

  * Adding people to the buying group who can say no, but not yes.
  * Nonlinear increases in your workload as communication compounds with each new person. 
  * Collective disresponsibility: the tendency to do less work as more people join a group.

**So Iâll play both sides of the conversation in this writeup:**

  1. [Mr. Brightside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGdGFtwCNBE): tactics to help you get and stay multithreaded with the right __ people. 
  2. The Darkside: how to navigate dysfunction and manage negative group dynamics.

All through the lens of [selling with
champions](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-enterprise-sales-
playbook#roles-in-the-buying-team). Because multithreading is where Buyer
Enablement steps up like Michael Jordan in the NBA Finals.

## **Four Tactics That Guarantee You'll Multithread With the Best of 'Em**

### **  
**1/ Find a Common Thread to Tie Contacts Together

First, startÂ by getting as clear as the waters in the Caribbean about how you
help each stakeholder in the deal.

**The phrase to help you here is, âWhich means.âÂ**

Here's an example. Letâs say your product automates the process of tracking
former users who recently changed jobs, and could champion your product for
their new company.

**âWhich meansâ will help you find the common thread across:**

> Daily Users âÂ > Directors & Champions â> Deciders & Executives

**While stating the problem, you could say:**

  1. Reps spend more time prospecting than managing pipeline, **which meansâ¦**
  2. Directors donât have pipeline coverage to hit team quota, **which meansâ¦**
  3. The SVP will miss their goal of returning 4X each sellerâs fully-loaded cost.

**While framing the productâs value, you could say:**

  1. Reps can engage warm leads who already know their value, **which meansâ¦**
  2. Directors always see a healthy pipeline coverage ratio, **which meansâ¦**
  3. The SVP hits every per-rep target in their financial model.

Now, your message ties everyone together.

### 2/ Handpick the Buying Team With Your Champions

Next, itâs time to work with your champions to buildout the buying team.

Assuming you have the [3 Tâs of
Multithreading](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-enterprise-sales-
playbook#the-three-ts-of-multithreading-with-champions) in place, start
weaving invitational language into your conversations to find and engage
the**right people:  
**

> _Who else will this project impact, that hasnât had a chance to weigh in
> yet?  
> _

> _Is there someone you turn to for advice on new projects or questions that
> are important to you?_

That last question is particularly helpful, because it draws out contacts from
the âshadow org chart,â and into your committee.Â

**It captures the reality that influence isn't found in:**

  * Hierarchies
  * Formal approvals
  * Structured process

**It's more often found in:**

  * Social capital
  * Internal reputation
  * Back-channeled convo's

Finding and adding high-influence (they can change internal direction) and
high-incentive (theyâre personally aligned with your deal) contacts to your
committee is key.  
â  

### 3/ Proactively Multithread in Parallel to Your Champions

Iâve worked on multiple deals involving four or more different business
units, where group calls started with introductions. Not for me. But for them.

**So that people inside the same company could meet each other for the first
time.Â**

Champions canât introduce you to people they donât know. So itâs your
job to enable them with outreach to new contacts who should be involved.

This type of outreach sounds like:  
â

>  _< New Contact >, I was hoping to include you in a conversation about <
> internal priority > with the < business unit > team next week. Would it make
> sense for you to weigh in on this?  
>  
> If this doesnât sound relevant for you right now, all good â < your
> business unit > tends to be closest to this topic at first, so I thought
> Iâd reach out._

Even if that contact doesnât take you up on the invitation, nobody was ever
mad they were invited into the process early. It can only help, especially if
theyÂ end up playing a role later on. They'll remember your invite.  
â

### 4/ Engage Your Own Team to Mirror the Buying Team

Your access to a buyer's team often mirrors _their_ access to _your_ team:

  * Bring an executive, meet their executive.
  * Bring a technical team, meet their technical team.
  * Collaborate with your team, multithread with theirs.
  * Operate in your own silo, they will too.

**Do the same thing you're asking your buyers to do**. **Show up with your
team.**

Language to kick this off might sound something like:  
â

>  _You mentioned needing to keep < Exec > posted, and itâs always helpful
> when weâre all on the same thread as questions or changes come up.  
>  
> So, I can either write them a quick update before our next call CCâing you
> and < Your Exec >, or, I can send it to you, so you can forward on the
> invite while CCâing us.  
>  
> What would you be more comfortable with?_

## **When Multithreading Goes Wrong: 5 Risks to Avoid**

###  
1/ Don't Ignore the Difference Between Contact & Deal Stages

Basing your deal stage (and therefore, close probability) on a small subset of
engaged contacts â like champions âÂ instead of group behavior is a recipe
for forecasting whiffs.

The reason is that buying committee members donât move in sync. Their
âcontact stagesâ donât line up with their âdeal stage.âÂ

If we simplify the reality of [wandering buying
processes](https://www.fluint.io/post/designing-a-sale-around-buying-
behaviors-two-shifts-that-win-deals) into a handful of stepsâ¦

  1. Problem Aware
  2. Commitment to Act
  3. Forming an Approach
  4. Developing Requirements
  5. Selecting a Preferred Vendor, etc.

â¦and apply these steps to a buying committee, you'll get:

  1. A manager who's selecting a vendor.
  2. A VP whoâs debating the right approach.
  3. A problem-aware operations team who's uncommitted.
  4. An executive whoâs focused on an entirely different priority.

**All inside a single deal record.**

_My champion's running pricing up the flagpole, so weâre at a 50%
probability,_ Â is something Iâve said about many deals.

â**Which subsequently exploded.**

Your champion may be all-in, but if the committee around them doesn't even
agree on the problem, you're back at step one.

**So hereâs what youâll want to do:**

  1. Ground your forecast on where the [âmassâ](https://www.fluint.io/post/measuring-deal-momentum-the-formula-for-enterprise-sales#:~:text=Mass%20in%20a%20B2B%20setting%20describes%20the%20decision%20making%20weight%20a%20contact%20brings%20to%20a%20deal.) of the buying group is. 
  2. Determine where in the process they are based on [these behaviors](https://www.fluint.io/post/designing-a-sale-around-buying-behaviors-two-shifts-that-win-deals#:~:text=Designing%20Pipeline%20Stages%20Around%20Buying%20Behaviors).
  3. Move your deals backwards as needed to line up with 1 & 2 here. (This will drive your leadership nuts, but it's better to be accurate than commit to what won't close.)  
â

### 2/ Don't Leave Champions to Handle Group ConflictÂ Alone

If your sale feels too smooth, thereâs a good chance your champions are
sanding down points of friction on their own, to keep your deal gliding along.

**The reality is someone always has a different opinion. You donât want to
leave champions to find and disarm those counterpoints alone.**

Instead, you want to ask questions that invite yourself into the consensus-
building process. Encourage dissent, and help the buying committee find
consensus by saying:

> _Seems like everythingâs moving forward smoothly, so Iâm wondering, is
> there someone on your team who you think might be willing to disagree with
> us, so we can be sure we have a good fit?_

**The key to this phrasing is â _willing_ _to disagree_.â**

Youâre asking for a nomination. Someone who would be so kind as to play the
role of devilâs advocate. Which is a practice Iâve used with my own
internal teams. If weâre launching a new project, we ask someone to poke
holes in the plan to make sure it stays on track.

**Guess who ends up filling the role? The strongest critic.**

If you're feeling some dissent already, call this out more directly:

> _It doesnât seem like < contact > fully agrees with this point. Is there
> something you feel we might have missed considering?_

The idea here is that thereâs never a single âdecision maker,â because
of all the people who can say no.

**While there may be one âeconomic buyer,â everyone in the committee who
can say "no" is a decision maker, too.**

âNo,â is a pretty clear decision just the same as âyes.â So you as the
committee grows, bring dissent into the open. Itâs exists whether youâre
part of addressing it, or not.Â  
â

### 3/ Stop the Sprawl:Â Don'tÂ Let the Buying Team Keep Expanding

Related to that last point, you want to keep the buying team narrow. If more
people get involved than you truly need, not only are you increasing deal risk
and indecision, you're compounding your workload.

Seth Godin describes how the volume of communications and approvals compounds
with each new person on the committee:

> Handshake Overhead is the result of the simple law of more people: **n*(n
> â 1)/2**. Two people need one handshake to be introduced. On the other
> hand, 10 people need 45 handshakes. More people involves more meetings, more
> approvals, more coordination.

Which means you can quickly devolve into a mini-communications-department-of-
one. Working reactively instead of [designing the flow of internal
communications.](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-map-b2b-decision-makers-
enterprise-account-maps-that-actually-help-win-deals)

With a massive workload that's way too much for one person to manage âÂ even
with a group of committed champions.

For example, if you apply the "Handshake Overhead"Â formula to the number of
people on the buying committee, multiplied by the number of deals in your
pipeline, [here's your
reality](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fQjV_K2OjLmw5CSc9yi8HwhTnqyL_h4I1vk1o5GDbp4/edit?usp=sharing):  
â

###  
4/ Donât Let These Cognitive Biases Crush Your Deal

There are two [errors in the way we think](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-
buyers-think-designing-buying-experiences-with-cognitive-bias-in-mind) that
can sneak up on your champions:

  1. **The False Consensus Effect.**   
Which leads people to overestimate just how much others actually agree with
them.  
â  

  2. **The Transparency Illusion.**   
Which causes us to believe that others know the full scope of what weâre
thinking.

Champions fall prey to both when they believe the rest of the buying team is
on the same page with them, when in fact, others may not understand why they
believe in the deal so strongly.

**A question like this can help pull your champion out of that illusion:**

> _It seems like you want others to want this more than they do. If thatâs a
> fair characterization, how do you think we could help them see what you
> see?_

**Or, you can try labeling someone who seemed to be scrolling LinkedIn during
your last call:**  

> _Seems like < contact > could be happy with any outcome to our
> conversations. Whether we move forward, or donât. Is there something
> missing from this project, that you think means this isnât a must-have for
> them?_

This is particularly key if who youâre calling out is a âHigh Influenceâ
contact.  
â

### 5/ Donât Multithread When You Hear These Two Things

There are a handful of occasions when multithreading is
**counterproductive**.Â

One case is when you see a buyer triangulating themself. Giving someone a
clear and direct ânoâ is uncomfortable. So theyâll deflect to their
team:

> _Sorry itâs taken a while to reply. The rest of our team just hasnât
> been very interested._

This means you need to ask a question, to separate their interest from their
teamâs:

> _Gotcha. How are you feeling about that? Were you wanting your team to want
> this too? Itâd be understandable if you werenât._

**Asking helps you determine if thereâs a challenge with the committee âÂ
or this one contact.**

Another occasion is discussing pricing. Holding a group call to discuss
pricing is rarely the way to go. The reason?

**People react how they believe theyâre supposed to react in group
settings.**

They're less likely to share what they truly think. _âWill I look like a
pushover if I donât push back on this?â_ Besides, you donât need group
approval on price. Just to finalize your scope. The first topic depends on
budgets. The second depends on needs.

**Since theyâre separate topics, make them separate meetings.**

Youâll have a more transparent and productive conversation this way.

An example here is:

> _< Champion >, Iâm thinking we have a good handle on the full groupâs
> needs now. It was also helpful to hear < Deciderâs > goal on keeping your
> recurring spend low.  
>  
> I rolled both of these inputs into a set of contract options for us to look
> at. Could the three of us put our heads together on feedback this week?_

###  
**Closing Thoughts  
â**  

  1. **Creating the MVC: Minimally Viable Committee**  

If you find that the buying committee keeps expanding, itâs a sign of
dysfunction. When weâre not confident, we let others decide for us. This
shifts the blame, because if I let you make the call, and things go south,
then ultimately, itâs your fault. Not mine.  

In this case, youâre _too_ multithreaded _._ Instead, you want to maintain
the MVC. **Just enough people to confirm the problem, create a use case, and
clear the contract.Â**  

â

  2. **Reselling the Problem & Priorities   
â**  
Lastly, if youâre still hitting unresolved conflict or indecision, you might
need to step back to see if somethingâs changed about the
[problem](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-build-a-compelling-problem-
statement-case-study) or its [level of
priority](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-sell-priorities-not-
problems-5-steps-to-shift-your-messaging).  

In complex deal cycles that stretch up to a year or longer, anything can
happen. For example, youâre more likely to hit turbulent air and get
rerouted while flying from London to Los Angeles, than from Los Angeles to San
Francisco.
