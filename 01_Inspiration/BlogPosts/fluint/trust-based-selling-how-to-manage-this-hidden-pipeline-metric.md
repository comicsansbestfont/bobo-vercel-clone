Creating and keeping trust is a must in sales. Obviously.

If a buyer doesnât trust the person theyâre working with â regardless of
their trust in the product â they wonât move forward.

â**But trust is one of those subjective, âsquishyâ topics.**

And most conversations about trust-based selling are too abstract to be
helpful. How, exactly, do you create trust in sales? Can you measure it? How
much do you really need to build?

**This post answers these questions with a simple mental model you can apply
to every deal.**

Itâs built from two hidden metrics that hold the power to close or kill
deals:

  * The Trust Hurdle
  * The Trust Quotient

Hereâs a quick visual example of a sales rep both enabling and erasing trust
(Y-axis) throughout their sales cycle (X-axis).

Study this for a second, then letâs dig in.

## **Clear the "Trust Hurdle" Before Closing**

The Trust Hurdle is a benchmark set by each buying team. It specifies how much
trust needs to be built before theyâll commit to you(r product).

If you push for a buying decision before youâve cleared this hurdle, your
deal will either wind up Closed Lost, or, youâll erase a portion of the
trust you had built. Which only makes it harder to clear the Hurdle.

**A variety of factors affect how high the Trust Hurdle is set, including:**

  1. Size of the investment.
  2. Perceived level of project risk.
  3. Past experiences with similar vendors.
  4. Personal accountability for project success.
  5. Level of internal alignment on the investment.

For example, letâs say youâre selling customer experience (CX) software.
The deal involves:

  * $1M investment with 100 hours of training time.
  * Brand-new approach to improving CX for high-value clients.
  * Past CX vendors who didnât fix a botched, customer-facing rollout.
  * Direct impact to the VP of Customer Successâ reputation and career.
  * A CRO who doesnât fully agree with the new approach.

The Trust Hurdle for this purchase will be quite high. Letâs say itâs set
at a â9â on a proverbial 10-point scale. Compare this to a deal where the
Hurdle may only be set at a 2 or 3:

  * $10K investment with 5 hours of training time.
  * Well-proven approach to managing CX for regular client base.
  * CX vendor comes with a solid reputation and trustworthy referrals.
  * The approach is fully supported by everyone.

From this example, youâll find that two things are true:

  1. The higher the Hurdle, the more complex the sale.
  2. Trust Hurdles are set higher in enterprise environments.

To figure out how high a specific dealâs Hurdle is compared to others in
your pipeline, try asking:

> _How significant is this investment, compared to others your team will make
> this year?_

> _How âriskyâ does your team feel this decision is, on a 10 point scale?_

> _Have you tried anything like this in the past? What was that experience
> like?_

> _What does the outcome of this project mean for you, personally?_

> _How do others feel about this? Anyone have a different perspective from
> yours?_

## **Manage Your "Trust Quotient" Throughout The Sales Cycle**

The Trust Quotient is how you can diagnose the amount of trust youâve built
during the sales cycle.

It combines all the interactions youâve had with your buyer into a single
score. That score is important because it tells you where, in relation to the
Trust Hurdle, you fall:

  1. If your Trust Quotient **>** your buyerâs Trust Hurdle, the deal is in a closing position.
  2. If your Trust Quotient **<** your buyerâs Trust Hurdle, the deal is **not ready** to close.

For better or worse, your interactions are open to interpretation. People
interpret motive, intention, and emotion from their experiences. This can
either help, or hinder, the trust youâre building. Interpretations are
rarely neutral. Instead, they fall into one of two categories:

  1. **Deposits.** Positive interactions that increase a buyerâs level of trust.
  2. **Withdrawals.** Negative interactions that reduce the level of trust.

These two categories are combined in the Trust Quotient, measured as:  
â

Note, there are two other factors the Trust Quotient accounts for:

  1. **Intensity**.  
â  
Each deposit or withdrawal is adjusted based on how âsmallâ or âlargeâ
it is. A few, intensely-positive experiences can build more trust than a
greater number of âalrightâ interactions.  
â  
For example, going out of your way to open up a free testing environment for a
highly-technical buyer makes for a larger deposit than sending over a pre-
recorded video demo.  
â

  2. **Doubled Denominator.  
â  
**Negative experiences are sticky. We hold onto them longer, and theyâre
stronger influences on our beliefs and decisions. There are all kinds of
studies citing how many positive experiences are needed to offset a negative
experience. Â For simplicity, we double the denominator here.  
â  
This means that a withdrawal will erase trust twice as fast as a deposit will
build it back up. In short, itâs easier to lose trust than create it.

## **Five Practices for Trust-Based Selling**

Now that you've got the framework in place, here are some specific practices
to try out.

### **1\. Divide up your deal history into two columns.**

Pick a handful of key accounts in your pipeline and scan their deal history in
your CRM. Make a mental note of whether each call, meeting, or email was a
deposit or a withdrawal.

Hereâs a shortlist of examples comparing deposits to withdrawals:

Some of the items in this list make for "outsized"Â deposits as compared to
others, too.

For example, [co-creating a business case](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-
build-test-loop-how-to-create-an-insanely-committed-champion-while-co-
creating-business-cases) enables a whole series of deposits as [part of the
process:](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-business-case-is-the-sales-process)

  * Problem statements that makes buyers feel, "OMG, finally someone who gets it."
  * Confidence sharing a sharp, concise message with their execs.
  * Building a sense of ownership with [the IKEAÂ effect.](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-build-test-loop-how-to-create-an-insanely-committed-champion-while-co-creating-business-cases#:~:text=Building%20Champions%20like%20IKEA%20Furniture)

Take it from Cobi. She talks about exactly this at the 1 minute mark in [this
short conversation](https://www.fluint.io/video/how-cobi-landed-a-multiyear-
deal-with-her-champion).

Listen to how she describes the way most executives approach sales
conversations, thinking:

_âIâve been hired to do a job and Iâm good at it, so I donât need you
telling meâ¦â_

By the way, if you want to use the exact same process as Cobi, [go

### **2\. Work with deal champions to engage skeptics.**

[Internal champions](http://www.fluint.io/post/the-uncommon-practice-of-
testing-sales-champions) have a major advantage over sales reps. They start
conversations as a colleague, with a bank of trust thatâs already been
built.

This gives them the benefit of the doubt when [asking
questions](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-hidden-link-between-deeper-
discovery-and-crafting-business-cases), or disarming
[objections](https://www.fluint.io/post/why-buyers-hide-their-objections-from-
you-and-what-to-do-about-it).

For example, a question like, â[Donât you think we should get <Decision
Maker> involved](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-multithread-navigate-
dysfunctional-buying-groups-in-enterprise-sales)?â may be interpreted as
âcontrollingâ when shared by a sales rep, but âthoughtfulâ coming from
a champion.

â

### **3\. State your intentions and request permission.**

Instead of leaving your motives open to interpretation, make them explicit.

[Use phrases](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-ask-better-questions-a-
roadmap-for-more-powerful-
discovery#:~:text=Principles%20for%20Asking%20Better%20Sales%20Questions)
like, âThe reason I ask...â and, âIâm asking this because...â to
signal positive intention. This is key when challenging prospects, making a
controversial statement, or asking an intimate question.

Requesting permission is a helpful practice when you want to ensure an
emotionally-charged moment is viewed positively. Try a phrase like:

> âIâm a little nervous to ask this, but I think it will help us. Would
> you mind if I ask, and you can decide if youâre comfortable discussing?â

â

### **4\. Determine if youâre starting from trust or skepticism.**

Customer referrals, review sites, brand reputation and marketing content are
all ways buyers form an impression of your company (and therefore, the people
who work there) before meeting you.

This can either set you back, or give you a significant boost, during your
first interactions. Try to discern where your buyer is coming from by asking a
question like:

> _âFor my context before we get rolling, Iâm curious what your impression
> of < Company > is?â_

â

### **5\. The larger the swing in score, the larger the promoter (or
detractor).**

The strongest skeptics, when won over, make for the most vocal advocates.

Thatâs because climbing from a proverbial score of â-5â to â+5â on
the Y-axis above is an [emotionally-intense
experience](https://www.fluint.io/post/5-things-flying-first-class-taught-me-
about-b2b-sales-experiences). A strong upswing is something customers will
want to share about.

The opposite is true, too. Gross missteps or mishandling the trust youâve
built are great ways to create detractors â people who canât wait to speak
poorly of their experience.

While the Trust Equation isnât a specific science, this mental model should
help you understand if your deals are moving into a closing position â so
you can take action accordingly.
