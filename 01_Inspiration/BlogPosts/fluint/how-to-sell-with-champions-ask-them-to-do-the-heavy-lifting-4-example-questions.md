Most people believe a sellerâs job is to pitch and close deals. But that
view is dated.

**Because sales reps donât close
deals.**[**Champions**](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-enterprise-
sales-playbook)**do.**

If you look at where buying decisions are actually made, itâs never during a
sales meeting. Itâs always during an internal meeting, without sales reps in
the room.

So the make-or-break moments in your deals generally happen outside of your
direct control. But not outside of your influenceâif youâre selling with
champions.

**Which means you need to share the workload.**

You need to move deals forward by working _through_ your buyers, while you, as
the seller, focus on enabling them. Buyer enablement typically happens in two
settings:

  1. **Written Content.  

â**Co-creating the [written materials, memos, and
narratives](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Sell-With-Champions-Ask-Them-to-Do-
Some-Heavy-Lifting-4-Example-Questions-339413a956714f2993cf7b981c2a7d0e) your
buyer will use to guide their internal conversations. Which canât be a
âconcierge,â done-for-you process. Buyers need to be part of doing the
work, which builds a sense of ownership in the deal.  

For example, the [Build-Test Loop helps you build
champions](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Sell-With-Champions-Ask-Them-to-Do-
Some-Heavy-Lifting-4-Example-Questions-339413a956714f2993cf7b981c2a7d0e), by
building a business case.**â  
â**

  2. **Conversations.**  

Sales conversations, done right, are always designed to create space for
buyers to think deeply, build conviction, and ultimately, sell themselves.  

This is [the art of discovery](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-ask-better-
questions-a-roadmap-for-more-powerful-discovery). It's less about gaining
information. It's more about gifting buyers greater conviction in how and why
they'll solve a high-cost, high-priority problem.

I do a lot of writing on this first topic.

**So I tagged in my friend,**[**Charles
Muhlbauer**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesmuhlbauer/)**, to break down
this second part for us:Â artful discovery, designed to increase buying
conviction, build champions, and share the workload.**

His perspective and practical examples were just too good, so I'm sharing it
all here.

And if you knowÂ Charles, you know he has this uncanny ability to ask exactly
the right question, in the right way. The right balance of candor and
compassion, humanity and _âHey now, are you even allowed to ask that?â_

Hereâs his take. Enjoy.

## Your Buyers Need to Do the Heavy Lifting Too â Hereâs How to Ask Them
To

**Nate:**

Whatâs some âtraditionalâ sales advice you often hear, that youâve
challenged over the years?

**Charles:**

We're often taught to do everything in our power to make a sale.

We focus on selling value, prepping for calls, asking the right questions,
handling objections, which is all important. But this also puts a lot of
pressure on us to do all the heavy lifting.

_What we often forget is that our buyers have a role to play in the sales
process._

By getting them to do a lot of the work, we can actually increase our chances
of closing deals, **because theyâre the one who are closing it themselves.**

**Nate:**

Iâm for it, but how do you do it? Whatâs an example of how you put this
into practice?

**Charles:**

Let's say you're running a demo for the second time, and you need to explain
what your company does in a large group setting.

Instead of taking on that responsibility yourself, why not ask your
championâor at least the person who recommended another callâto explain it
to the group?

If you do, youâll not only take some of the pressure off yourself, you'll be
empowering the prospect to sell your company to their own colleagues. That
might sound like saying:

> "Mike, I see Bob joined our demo today. Did you want to provide him with
> some context on how youâre potentially thinking about using our offering
> for your team, and the purpose of our call today?"

Here, youâre putting your champion to work, while they're taking
responsibility for providing context on your offering for the newcomers.

**Nate:**

I dig it. Especially great in group settings, where your champion is likely
more aware of the dynamics inside a large group.

Okay now, if you apply this same approach later in the sales cycle, while
negotiating pricing let's say, what would that look like?

**Charles:**

Well letâs say the buying team is giving you a hard time about price.

Instead of Â offering a reduced price, why not ask them what they would be
willing to pay?

By asking them to give you an answer, you're making them a more active
participant in the negotiation. Which not only takes some Â pressure off you,
itâll Â help create more trust and transparency in the relationship.

That might sound like saying:

> âSounds like thereâs a range you have in mind, that might propel this
> forwardâ¦â

Do your best to empower them to think Â about how to work with you. Make them
Â work, too.

**Nate:**

Definitely a scenario where reps feel pressured, and this approach reduces
that. Okay, how about another scenario? Whatâs another discovery question
you might use to "share the work?"

**Charles:**

Another example is when a buyer feels your offering is a nice-to-have, but not
necessarily a need-to-have. Instead of getting defensive, try to understand
why they feel that way.

Ask them a direct question to get to the root of their concerns, which will
let you create a more personalized response that speaks to their specific
needs. This not only helps you build rapport, it'll also show your buyers that
you're invested in their success.

This might sound like saying:

> âBased on [the challenges youâre looking to solve for], what do you feel
> is missing from our offering, in order for this to be a need-to-have versus
> a nice-to-have?â

Here, youâre cutting right to the heart of the issue.

Somewhat surprisingly, this turns into a more positive discussion many times.

**Nate:**

Good stuff. Letâs do one more. Whatâs a last discovery question youâd
ask, to share the work with your champions?

**Charles:**

This is where Iâm âlooking for trouble,â by asking my champion what
might stop the buying team from moving forward with our deal.

By asking them to articulate their team's decision criteria and success
metrics, you're making them a more active participant.

Which also ensures you're investing your time and resources into a buying team
whoâs genuinely interested. Sometimes, what champions want and what a buying
team wants are different things.

So this might sound like:

> âIf you had to think about the top two things that would stop us from
> moving forward, what comes to mind?â

Getting to the truth helps you both make sure youâre spending your time
well, and you'll end up spending less time on the opportunities that will
absorb the most.

**Nate:**

To wrap us up, youâve sold, built enablement programs, and coached 300+
sellers. Across them all, what type of results are you seeing using this
approach?

**Charles:**

For me Â and my clients, weâre empowered to let our buyers sell themselves
on the right solution, as opposed to the other way around.

â**The buyer is selling you, and buying for themselves.** Which is magical,
if you can let go.

Plus, by getting buyers to do some of the work, weâre making the sale more
efficient and effective. We can be more present on calls, ask direct
questions, and ultimately win more deals.

So, the next time you find yourself struggling to make a sale, try getting
your buyers to do some of the heavy lifting. You might be surprised at how
effective it can be.
