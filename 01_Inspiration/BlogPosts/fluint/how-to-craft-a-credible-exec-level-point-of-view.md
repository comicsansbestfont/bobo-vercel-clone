When sales leaders say âbuild a POVâ (point of view), hereâs what they
mean â and how to do it:

Youâre looking at a âdriver graphâ here.

Which is a concept from the FP&A world, and it models out all the cause-and-
effect relationships behind a companyâs core metrics.

Understanding how to create this for your target accounts â especially if
youâre not verticalized, and cover a few different industries â is table
stakes.

## To start crafting a point of view, start on the left side:

(1) Whatâs the highest-level metric your end buyer (the âEBâ) owns?

(2) When that exec stands up at their next board meeting, and they talk about
whatâs been changing or trending since last year/quarter â and where
theyâre headed in the next 2-3+ years â which âlinkâ in the driver
chain are they focused on?

For example, if revenueâs down inside an e-commerce business, is that
because:

  * of customers in their base shrank?
  * same #, but theyâre spending less?

(3) Then, if that exec talks to their SVP about why net sales / customer is
down, and that SVP talks to their VP about declining average order values
(AOV), whatâs trending there?

(4) Now, letâs say that VP goes and talks to their Director, and discovers
that cart volume (# items / order) is down year-over-year.

How are they gonna fix it?

Thatâs where your point of view comes in:

Itâs the intersection of all the above + what you can do
differently/uniquely as the answer:

To âthink big & act smallâ as my friend Brandon Fluharty says:

  * Big impact at a high level
  * With a specific, credible link to their operating model

## So, when you create an overall flow fromâ¦

  * Left side: **_what_** metric youâd like to influence
  * Right side: **_how_** you plan to impact it

â¦then, youâve built a point of view. Which is just sales speak for saying
you:

  1. Crafted a message that resonates at an exec level
  2. With a set of âlayered,â high-priority problem statements
  3. With a specific (and therefore believable) approach to fix it
  4. And a clear way to measure the outcomes + early indicators

All while threading together the right contacts at every level. Which you can
tie into your overall exec summary, to keep deals moving forward â while
guiding discovery.
