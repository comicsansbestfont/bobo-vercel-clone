Nate Nasralla is the Founder at Fluint.io. Especially in the realm of online
selling, having champions who can articulate your value in their own, internal
language can make or break a deal. In this episode, Nate also categorizes a
champion differently from influencers and coaches and breaks down how
influence, incentive, and information are necessary components of a champion.

He explains how to use "languaging" to mirror back your buyerâs words and
increase the chances of a favorable outcome.

QUOTES

> "Sales reps don't close deals. Buyers do. You can get a deal done without a
> sales rep. You cannot, ever, get a deal done without a buyer in place."  
>

> "When I think about the profile of a champion, one, there's influence.
> They're able to help develop or shape the opinions of others. There's also
> incentive. There's something in it for them. There's a personal connection
> to that deal. And then, information. They actually can help you navigate
> through the sales cycle."

> "If I have a request and I want it to be approved, I'm going to make sure to
> use the same types of language that my exec or my VP is saying in our team
> calls and our team updates âÂ how we're talking about our OKR's or
> whatever the goals are â to increase the probability that they respond
> favorably."
