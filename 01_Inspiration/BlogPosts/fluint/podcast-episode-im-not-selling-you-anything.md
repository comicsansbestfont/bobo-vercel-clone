If you're in sales and lost a deal before you've probably found yourself going
down the What-If list. What if i showed this? What if I said that?

Fact is, you're not in the room when the decision is made. That's where our
guest [Nate Nasralla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natenasralla/), founder of
[Fluint](https://www.fluint.io/), steps in. Fluint helps you sell with a
committed champion during every deal to ensure a seat at the decision table.

When Nate isn't busy building companies that solve major problems he enjoys
snowboarding the backcountry, reading War & Peace while eating waffles, and
smart comedy.

You've got 20 minutes, lean in and listen to Brian and Nate chop it up on
INSYA.
