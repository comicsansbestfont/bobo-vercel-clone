Thereâs this parable David Foster Wallace made famous during his 2005
graduation speech at Kenyon College:

> Two young fish are swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish
> swimming the other way who nods at them and says, âMorning, boys. Howâs
> the water?â  
>  
> The two young fish swim on for a bit, then eventually one of them looks over
> at the other and goes âWhat the h*ll is water?â

The point of the story?

The most obvious and important realities are often the hardest to see and talk
about.

I want to talk about one of these obvious, unseen realities:

The fact [sales reps donât close deals](https://www.fluint.io/resource-
content/the-enterprise-sales-playbook#two-takeaways). Buyers do.

## The Water Sales Teams Swim In

Because this realityâs forgotten â or maybe, never really understood in
the first place â it shows up in the way most every sales team builds their
process, playbook, and day-to-day operating model.

**In other words, the âwaterâ sales reps swim in.**

Which is more like a mixture:

A blend of beliefs and behaviors thatâve become normalized over the past two
decades, which continue to put sales reps at the center of the sales process.

(See? Nothing _sounds_ off there, right?)

Weâll call the âwaterâ most of us swim in **âSales Process 1.0.â**

Which quite frankly, is backwards and counterproductive. Because it starts
with the wrong premise and ignores the realities:

  1. **Buying decisions are made during internal meetings â not sales meetings.**   
So sales reps are rarely in the room for the moments that create and kills
deals. Your buyers are, however.

  2. **You can remove sales reps from the buying process and still get a deal done.**   
But remove your buyer from the sales process and youâve got nothing.

  3. **Internal buying behavior is the only true measure of where a deal stands.**   
Yet sales stages focused on a sellerâs activity only captures a fraction of
a deal.  
Example: sending out a proposal doesnât tell you anything. (A sales
activity.) Did the executive read it? Do they care? (A buying activity.)

Soâ¦ howâs Sales Process 1.0 working out for you?

## The Typical Sales Teamâs Reality: Sales Process 1.0 by the Numbers

[Ebsta & Pavilionâs 2024 State of Sales](https://www.ebsta.com/wp-
content/uploads/2024/02/B2B-Sales-Benchmarks-2024_.pdf) is a pretty
fascinating read.

The one-sentence summary of 4.2 million opportunities across 530 companies is
this:

_The typical sales teams is swimming upstream, fighting against the current by
spending, hiring, and doing more â to win less._

By the numbers:

Soâ¦ why?

âWell, you know, the macroâs not great. Interest rates are up,
spendingâs downâ¦â

Yada yada yada.

Itâs a tempting soundbite. But Iâve yet to meet a sales leader whoâs
walking into a board meeting suggesting the macro environment is 100% of the
reason why 69% of reps are missing quota in 2024 â even though quotas are
19% _smaller_ this year.

Because that would raise a few eyebrows, and a few follow-up questions:

  * Why are other sales teams theyâre on the board of posting higher velocity this year â with relatively little changes in their product and target market?

PS, weâre releasing new data on this next week.

[Signup here](https://lu.ma/introducing-sales-process-20-rewriting-the-sales-
led-gtm-playbook) to be the first to see it.

  * Why are some reps â who sell the same product, to the same customer, on the same team â producing 8.9X the sales velocity of everyone else?

## Weâre in a Massive âSea Changeâ after a Decades-Long Shift

So whatâs different about the teams and reps selling _more_ this year? Well,
theyâve noticed something about the water theyâre swimming in:

**Their mid-funnel looked the _exact same_ as it did two decades ago.**

It stayed static, while the reality of selling changed. (See above.)

While their top-of-funnel evolved to focus on buying behaviors (e.g. the rise
of intent data and âsignal-based selling)â¦ from their first discovery call
forward?

Same old, same old.

Sure, they sprinkled in some Conversation Intelligence. Better demos, better
battlecards, better objection handling. But it all focused on the same
premise:

_The sales rep in the sales meeting._

Instead of taking [Doryâs advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Hkn-
LSh7es) to keep on swimming right through a massive sea change, they did
change. By re-approaching things from a different premise:

  * Sales Process 1.0 was about sales reps in sales meetings.
  * Sales Process 2.0 is about buyers in internal meetings.

## Introducing Sales Process 2.0

[On April 18th, weâre introducing Sales Process
2.0](https://lu.ma/introducing-sales-process-20-rewriting-the-sales-led-gtm-
playbook).

A detailed playbook showing you _exactly_ how to dial up sales velocity by 10X
â with data from sales teams who already have.

**Itâs a process that drives more revenue** **â with less people and
pipeline.**

Because hereâs the thing: you can have it both ways. Growth, and efficiency.

Before the full playbook release, hereâs a one-page summary you can
reference to see where things are headed.
