Hereâs a move 98% of sellers will ignore.

Which is unfortunate, because itâs landed me and my teams multiple 6 and
7-figure deals. And itâs as close as I can come to guaranteeing you
executive attention:

**Build a future-state press release, with a headline thatâs the outcome of
something you enable for your customers.**

It's a way to "work backwards" from your customer's desired outcome, to help
design your deals accordingly.

Which is an approach and way of thinking first created inside of Amazon:Â

> There are two ways to extend a business. Take inventory of what you're good
> at and extend out from your skills. Or determine what your customers need
> and work backward, even if it requires learning new skills.

## **Crafting a Compelling One-Pager**

This is a subtle yet massively important distinction:

  * Most sellers begin with their product, and work forward searching for a problem to match.  
â

  * The top sellers start with [customer's priorities](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-sell-priorities-not-problems-5-steps-to-shift-your-messaging), and work backward. Designing a path to get them there, even if it requires creating new capabilities inside their company.

It's a close cousin to the process of [writing a compelling one-
pager](https://www.fluint.io/resources/interactive-guide-the-1-page-business-
case), another Amazon staple. **A strategic document designed to:Â**

### **How to Write a "Future State Press Release"**

â**â** Hereâs a step-by-step break down, with some pro tips I've picked
up over the years.

**  
1/ Go to the âPressâ or âNewsâ section in your prospect's website
footer.**

Grab a past release to mirror their formatting and layout.

It's ideal if they also have a âbrand kitâ available on their site you can
build from.

**  
2/ Focus on a past release, quoting your target exec.**

Read through Â direct quotes inside the release. Note Â tone, writing style,
and choice of words.

**  
3/ Rewrite the headline, 10 different times.**

You canât write good headlines in one take. (ChatGPT canât either.)

David Ogilvy, copywriting legend, said he rewrote the headlines on his best
performing ads up to 104 different times. Because nothing else in the content
matters if this doesât land.

Think about something that stirs up strong emotion.

e.g. if youâre writing for a Chief Customer Officer, you might lead with:

> _[Company] lands whopping $250M Series C in downmarket, thanks to a new,
> âCustomer-Led GTMâ strategy._

Use a phrase theyâre already saying to their own team too, like Customer-Led
GTM.

**  
4/ Insert a new narrative into the body.**

**â** This is where you weave in your new quotes, using their language.

Plus a rundown on what the future looks like, to help them step into it. Which
will set up contrast when you deliver the press release.Â Remember:

> [Value = future payoff - current problem.](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-
> to-design-a-value-based-sale-and-drive-business-impact)

**  
5/ âReleaseâ the press release, creatively.**

Iâve bought $10 domains like "companynamewins.com" to host it. I've also had
it delivered and signed for by courier. Make it memorable.

A very important step, too: co-author this with your champion. They should
have the final read and signoff, before it goes to the exec.

(If you donât have a champion, this can also work at top-funnel.)

### **Get Amazon's Press Release Framework**

I say 98% of reps wonât do this, because itâs not easy.

It takes extra time and creativity to write a thoughtful release, and the
[close rate](https://www.fluint.io/post/why-close-rate-is-the-metric-
of-2023-5-ways-to-increase-yours) isnât 100%.

But man, itâs fun, life-giving, and so worth trying. For example, the most
fun I've ever had using this was when a customer published the release âÂ
almost verbatim âÂ after our deal closed.
