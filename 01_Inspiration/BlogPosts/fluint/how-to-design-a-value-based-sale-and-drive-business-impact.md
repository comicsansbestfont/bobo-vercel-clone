Have you ever been told to âsell valueâ by a sales leader?Â

If so, you know itâs a throwaway piece of advice that _seems_ helpful. But
itâs like telling a runner, âJust run faster!â I meanâ¦. yeah, sure.
Iâd love to. But how?

âValueâ is one of those squishy topics nobody defines in a specific,
concrete way.

Send more eBooks? Be more âhelpful?â What, exactly, **_is_** value?

## What âSelling Valueâ Actually Means

Hereâs a simple but specific definition of value:

> **Value = Positive OutcomesÂ â Negative Outcomes**

Itâs the space between two potential futures. One thatâs desirable. One
thatâs not.  
â

When a customer faces a problem, they can either choose to move toward:

  * **Negative Outcomes:** The cost of a [problem](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-build-a-compelling-problem-statement-case-study) if it's left unsolved.
  * **Positive Outcomes:** A payoff that's unlocked by making a change.

Which means value increases when:

  * The cost of the problem you'll avoid increases.
  * The return from a new project you'll rollout increases.

Most sellers have heard some of this described as "quantify pain." Itâs a
good start.

But you can also take that a few steps further to dial your âvalue storyâ
up to 100.  
â

## Two Principles for Crafting a âValue Storyâ

Most people tend to believe that a solid business case is all about the
numbers. Showing an ROI that's too big to say no to.

But a true business case is built around an [internal
narrative](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-in-
enterprise-sales-how-to-craft-internal-narratives), a storyline, that puts
those numbers in the context of:Â

Our brains are wired to understand the narrative structure, which is built on
two principles:

  1. **A Consistent Pattern:** Joseph Campbell's _The Hero's Journey_ showed how every memorable story is designed around the _exact same_ pattern.   

An interesting character encounters a problem, which forces them to choose a
path forward. That choice will lead to one of two endings.Â Comedy, or
tragedy.  
â

  2. **Contrast:** Our brains â¤ï¸ contrast. We canât see âvalueâ in isolation. Only when things stand in comparison to each other. Which is why a good story highlights both:  

\- Comedy: **Positive** outcomes we get to live out.  
\- Tragedy: **Negative** outcomes we just avoided.  

It's easier to make a choice between black and white than shades of gray.  

**  
**You'll apply both of these principles to the storyline inside a business
case âÂ a type of**Value Story** ,Â in other words âÂ when you:

  1. **Move from costs to consequences.**   

The cost of inaction (COI)Â is a 1st-order effect. But prospects need to
connect this to the 2nd- and 3rd-order effects, too. The negative **outcomes
_,_** in other words.Â For example:  

**1st Level (COI):** âWe lost $2M **ARR** we shouldâve won this
quarter.â  
â  
**2nd Level:** âWinning less customers with the same salesÂ &Â marketing
spend inflated our cost to acquire customers (**CAC**).â  
â  
**3rd Level:** âOur **GTM Efficiency** is pretty ugly right now, yet weâre
about to fundraise in a tough capital market. Hello, dilution.â  
â

  2. **Flip those consequences upside down to find the payoff.**  

Like we said, value = the positive outcomes you enable (â) the negative
outcomes created by the current state.  

So, if you measure the problem with ARR, CAC, and GTM Efficiency, the payoff
should be measured **with those exact same metrics.**

## Building a Bridge: Sell an âApproachâ Before a Product

Your job as a seller is to [build a bridge](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-
ask-better-questions-a-roadmap-for-more-powerful-discovery) between the
customer's current and future states. To show them the path that avoids
tragedy, and ends in comedy.

So how do you that, practically speaking?Â You make a _strategic_
recommendation to guide the customerâs _approach_ to[ creating
change](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-change-equation-a-framework-to-keep-
deals-from-falling-apart).

**The approach is _how_ you solve a problem. Not _who_ or _what_ solves it.**

Which is what the majority of sellers miss. They hear a problem, they show
their solution. While completely forgetting to eliminate **project** risk
(choosing to take an altogether different path), and focusing too narrowly on
**product** riskÂ (walking a specific path with someone else).

It's easy to miss because the approach is neutral framing. It's vendor
agnostic.

So before you speak to a specific set of features, confirm everyoneâs
aligned on the higher-order questions of:

  * Whatâs the right **value driver** to focus on?
  * What must be true about **how** we impact that driver?

I say again. The approach isn't âbuy XYZ software.â

Instead, itâs focused on a core shift, practice, or project that **impacts**
**a specific value driver**.

Less, âuse our content automation." More, âshift the mix of leads from
paid to organic sources.â  
â

## Influencing a Newly-Hired CROâs Approach &Â Impacting Value Drivers

Take a newly hired CRO as an example.

Let's say her company just raised a Series B. Now, she's got to deliver on the
happy ending they promised investors. So the CRO will ask herself, â
_Whatâs my biggest revenue opportunity?â_

Is it acquiring new logos? Boosting net revenue retention (NRR)?

**Letâs say itâs NRR. Investors were talking about that a lot.Â But does
she...**

  * ...hire more AM's for the enterprise segment?
  * ...find untapped cross-sells for SMB's?
  * ...take an altogether different path?

**There are lots of different value drivers she can focus on.**

In fact, if you look at this example âdriver treeâ, youâll notice that
when you sell to executives who own very high-level metrics, **they have lots
of choices, trade-offs, and competing priorities.**

You can âdrive revenueâ in a lot of ways:

If you haven't seen a driver tree before, here's a quick definition:

> A way to **map the value** created by a company, by linking outcomes to a
> series of inputs. On the left side, list a target metric youâd like to
> impact. On the right, you'll see what "drives" that metric.

Okay, so, this CROâs got to pick her priority today, which will affect
buying decisions tomorrow.

Now, let's suppose you sell a sales intelligence platform that helps generate
leads. You see this CRO was just hired. She just raised a Series B. Perfect
timing to reach out, right?

Well, if the CROâs thesis is that a singular focus on NRR is best âÂ so
sheâs entirely focused on expanding revenue from the customers who already
love them â you have one of two options while designing your deal:  
â

  1. **Align with her thesis.**   

Letâs say you can give her data on customers who recently changed jobs, and
could champion her product at their new company.  
â

  2. **Reshape her thesis.**   

How long can she afford to focus on NRR, without landing new logos? Arenât
the seeds for NRR sown early, during the new sales and onboarding process?

If thereâs no logical bridge between her priority and your productâan
approach that sheâs aligned withâitâs not time to sell your product.
There's still more to the story.  
â

## Enable Your Champions With this Value Story Framework

So, back to our first point.

Whenever you're told to "sell value," here's how to actually do that:Â

  1. **Setting** :Â understand where your customer is today, and where they want to go tomorrow. 
  2. **Choice** :Â map the customer's business using a driver tree, and settle on the right approach.
  3. **Ending** :Â measure the problem, and flipÂ it upside down to create contrast to a clear payoff.

Once you've outlined these three elements, [use this "Mad Libs" style
framework](https://www.fluint.io/resources/value-story-framework) andÂ **plug
in** your buyers' own words from your sales meetings.

**Or, just**[**have Fluint write the first draft for
you**](https://www.fluint.io/video/fluint-demo-and-product-walkthrough)**.**

It'll help you craft a Value Story with your champions, to guide their
internal buying convo's.
