It's wild how many sales teams still rely on the old â3X pipeline
coverageâ rule of thumb.  

Even though reps building a 3-4X pipeline coverage **_and_** missing quota
happens more frequently than a Taylor Swift concert selling out.  

On the flipside, there's a another type of team who manages to plan through a
deep understanding of weighted pipeline âÂ and the [relationship between
pipeline coverage and close rate](https://www.fluint.io/post/why-close-rate-
is-the-metric-of-2024-5-ways-to-increase-yours), across [each stage of the
process](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-cut-deal-slippage-compress-sales-
cycles).  

**Are you that type of team?**

Well, if this write-up feels a little bit too "101-level" for you, you're
probably "Type 2."

But, this is also one of those topics that sales leaders _know_ , but don't go
nearly deep enough in _doing something_ about it.  
â

### The Two Types of Sales Teams

At the risk of oversimplifying things, there are two types of sales teams out
there:  

  1. **Type 1: Wins by âvolume.â**  

Close rates are chronically hovering ~20%, so leadershipâs always hammering
prospecting to make sure reps "get after it," always feeling they don't have
enough pipeline coverage.**  
â**

  2. **Type 2: Wins by ârate.â**  

These teams [break down their process stage by
stage](https://www.fluint.io/post/designing-a-sale-around-buying-behaviors-
two-shifts-that-win-deals). Leaning into the stages with the biggest leakage,
by rolling out targeted programming to win more âÂ with less pipe.  
â  

The 1st type of team wins by **force**. The 2nd wins with **finesse**.  

â

### Making the Shift from Type 1 to 2

Iâm going to simplify a scenario from an HR tech company we work with.Â

The typical AE on the team:  

  * Built roughly **$1M in quarterly pipeline** , vs. a target of $250K. 
  * Which is typically seen as a "good" 4:1 ratio.
  * But really, they leaked a massive amount of revenue between Stages 3 & 4.
  * The **~40% Stage 3 â 4 rate** cut their overall win rate to 21%

Which looked something like this:

Keeping $215KÂ of the $1MÂ in pipeline the team _already spent good time and
money to create_ is a hard (and expensive)Â way to win.

But the good news is they made this shift to a âType 2" team earlier this
year.

### What type of team are you?  

As a quick aside, hereâs how youâll know which type of team youâre
building.

Mid-quarter, youâll either hear:  
â  

##### Type 1:  

> âCan you pull a few of those deals forward?â  
> âWhy arenât we sourcing 15 opps, minimum?â  
> âCan you get them back with a bigger offer?â  
>

And my personal favoriteâ¦  

> âSetup the meeting, Iâll handle this one.â  
>

#####  
Type 2:  

> âWhatâs happening in the buying team at S3?â  
> âCan we navigate it with them upstream, at S2?â  
> âWhat process / skill gap will that mean closing?â  
>

Okay, back to our example.

Now, in this case, deals would stall when the HR team got excited, their demos
went flawlessly, they were multithreaded, quantified âpain,â etcâ¦  

**But then? Nada.**

Total silence.  

So they'd start their quarter feeling confident. They'd invested heavily in
pipegen. And yet, they were still finishing ~15% short of their targets.

Spread across 15 new business reps?Â That gap started to add up pretty
quickly.  

**So what was the issue?**

Their deals would get de-prioritized by Finance & Ops mid-funnnel.  

Which meant their sellers needed to start engaging the COO â not just the
CHRO â earlier in the cycle.

**So how'd they approach it?**

By crafting messaging that tapped into corporate initiatives and a [high-level
priority](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-sell-priorities-not-
problems-5-steps-to-shift-your-messaging).  

#### How, exactly, did that work?  

There were a few steps â which all started by recognizing only a fraction of
deals had any account-specific business case in place. Because [their process
wasn't setup to fill that gap](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-business-case-
is-the-sales-process).

Together, we focused on:

**Which meant their approach in S1 â S3 completely changed, to solve the S3
â S4 gap.**

Reps learned a new approach, leaders switched uphow they ran deal reviews, and
win rates jumped (up to 28% overall).  

While this did slow down their time to go from S1 â S3, it also cut S3 â
S5 by 10 days.  

And their reps loved it.

Because even with less pipe, they were delivering more revenue.  

#### Questions for you to consider here.  

  1. What sounds more like your team? Type 1, or 2?  
â

  2. If you're a "Type 2" team, where's your process breaking down?  
â

  3. What, specifically, are you planning to address that this week?
