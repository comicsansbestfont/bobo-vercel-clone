Close rate is **the** metric of 2025.

New meetings booked have dropped off across the board, and top-funnel activity
isn't making up the difference.

Plus, even more activity could cover the pipeline gap, a pure focus on adding
more opportunities hits a point of diminishing returns, fast.

There are a few reasons for this.

## Close rate is directly tied to increased revenue in a way pipeline coverage
isnât.

You can increase your pipeline coverage without actually increasing revenue.

That's because of ahidden link between each variable in the revenue equation:

> (1 Revenue = (2) Close Rate (x) (3) Qualified Pipeline

> (3) Qualified Pipeline = (4) # of Qualified Opportunities (x) (5) Average
> Contract Value (ACV)

When reps are behind on revenue, they often focus on adding more
opportunities.

It seems like the fast path. But a focus on increasing (2)Â close rates will
often mean:

  * (4) The number of opportunities in a sellerâs pipeline _decreases_.**â**
  * (5)**** The average contract value of each opportunity _increases_.

Why's that? Well, thatâs because:

  * **Your time to sell each week stays the same.**  

As the number of opportunities you're managing increases, existing deals get
short-changed. Somethingâs gotta give, so eventually, the resulting drop in
quality time outweighs the gains in pipeline.

  * **Thereâs a compounding effect as âdeal debtâ piles up.**  

You accumulate deal debt when you invest your TEA (time, energy, attention, as
my friend [Brandon](https://brandonfluharty.com/rethink-time-as-money-to-make-
better-decisions-as-a-saas-seller/) calls it) into low-quality deals, which
starves high-potential deals of that same TEA. Youâll eventually pay for
those shortcuts, just like a product team with too much tech debt.

  * **Paying down deal debt drives both revenue metrics at once.**  

Take a look at the leaderboard on your team. What youâll likely see is that
the leading reps arenât just closing at a higher rate â theyâre closing
larger deals.  

Investing more time and energy into a deal means discovering new use cases,
building deeper value, less price sensitivity, and more buying confidence.
Which = larger ACV.  

In other words, thereâs a âco-linearâ relationship between ACV and close
rate, whereas pipeline coverage vs. close rates have an âinverseâ
relationship. ([The JOLT
Effect](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593538102?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_QP6M5PFB4QB6MEGHFB5C)
authors point this out in this their research. As ACV is discounted, close
rates decline as well.)

Here's a set of examples to put some numbers behinds these points.

**Let's suppose that for every 5 opportunities you stop working, your close
rate jumps 5%.**

If you make that trade once, your revenue stays the same, and then drops off:

But that's not the full story.

Now, let's look at the scenario again, but with a $15K increase in ACV for
every 5 opportunities given up this time.

Now, you'd definitely make the trade down to 20 opportunities.

In fact, you'd even prefer 15 to 25 opportunities:

Often, however, the differences aren't so small. The typical gap between low
and high performers in _The JOLTÂ Effect_ was typically as significant as 20%Â
vs. 50%.

So, look at the difference in revenue between a seller who invests their TEAÂ
in winning 10, high-value opportunities instead of spreading themselves thin
across 25:

And, depending on how strategic each deal is that you're working on, the
difference between your high and low value opportunities can be millions.

$150K vs. $1.5M, $15M, or more.

## When pipeline becomes the goal, itâs no longer an effective measure.

If the number one metric that comes up in every 1:1 and forecast call is
pipeline coverage, what do you do?

Well, you try to open as many opportunities as you can.

You relax your acceptance criteria a bit. You start nudging first
conversations forward in the pipeline earlier, hoping they turn out for the
best.

(Often called the âCobra Effect,â from when the British government paid
people in Dehli for each dead snake they turned in during colonial rule. They
wanted to get rid of them. So what' people do? They started breeding cobras
like crazy, and the number of cobras only _increased_.)

Okay, the table's set. Time to eat.

Close rateâs important, but how do you increase it?

**Here are four points to start with:**

  1. Measure and improve close rates one stage at a time.
  2. Break down âclosingâ into a series of smaller skillsets.
  3. Shape your message when won/loss decisions are made.
  4. Measure and manage your personal tipping point.

### 1/ Measure and improve close rates one stage at a time.

Choosing to buy something isnât making âaâ decision.

Itâs making a series of decisions that add up throughout the buying process.
Which means:

  * Close rates increase when you win **repeatedly** _,_ at every stage.
  * Close rates can decrease **at any point** in the buying process.

**In other words, your close rate is the average of every stageâs close rate
in the cycle.**

Which means that if youâre not already calculating your close rate by stage,
you should, to:

#### âUnderstand the value of your personal, discounted pipeline.

Different reps have different close rates at each stage. So relying on "raw"
pipeline values, or even discounted pipeline applying default rates, gives you
false signals.

For example, letâs say two reps have the exact same pipeline. The same
number of deals, in the same stages, with the same forecasted contract value.

Look at the difference in discounted pipeline, using their _individual_ close
rates for each stage:

vs.Â

Again, they both have the same deals, in the same stages. But very different
forecasts.

677K vs. 508K.

#### âFocus on a smaller set of stage-specific close rates.

Itâs hard to approach a composite metric like close rate when youâre only
looking at it in the aggregate.

Instead, try to:

  1. Break out new [pipeline stages based on buying behaviors](https://www.fluint.io/post/designing-a-sale-around-buying-behaviors-two-shifts-that-win-deals).
  2. Assign clear exit criteria to move stage â stage.
  3. Look for the lowest close rates by stage.
  4. Ask, whatâs preventing them from moving forward?
  5. Pin point their fear / doubts / uncertainty.
  6. Intentionally address it in the _prior_ stage.
  7. Repeat, from the lowest â highest close rate.

In the example we used above, Iâd suspect Rep #2 needs to sharpen their
discovery skills.

They win a far lower percentage of deals through Stage 2 (20%) than Rep #1
(who wins 55%).

That's likely because Rep A has figured out how to go deep on quantifying pain
that relates to an [exec-level priority](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-
sell-priorities-not-problems-5-steps-to-shift-your-messaging).  
â

### 2/ Break down âclosingâ into a series of smaller skillsets.

Related to this last point, a lot of us have a bad habit of referring to reps
as âclosers.â As if itâs a skill some have, others donât.

**Closing isnât a skill. Itâs an outcome. The byproduct of**[**a long list
of skills**](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-enterprise-sellers-personal-
development-framework)**working together.**

The rep who...

  1. Finds and frames a high-cost, high-priority [problem](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-build-a-compelling-problem-statement-case-study).
  2. Develops committed, high-influence [deal champions](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-enterprise-sales-playbook#part-2-the-deal-champion-job-description).
  3. Builds consensus [across a team](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-multithread-navigate-dysfunctional-buying-groups-in-enterprise-sales) on the right approach.
  4. Gains [executive-level attention](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-avoid-screwing-up-executive-level-sales-meetings) by painting a bold vision.
  5. Crafts a case for investment & change with a [compelling narrative](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-in-enterprise-sales-how-to-craft-internal-narratives).
  6. Maintains genuine [urgency](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-build-mutual-action-plans-your-buyers-actually-follow-through-on) and follow-through with a [mutual plan](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-build-mutual-action-plans-your-buyers-actually-follow-through-on).
  7. Gracefully navigates [blockers](https://www.fluint.io/post/why-buyers-hide-their-objections-from-you-and-what-to-do-about-it) that come up along the way.

...is a "closer."

Yet too many drive-by managers will tell a rep whoâs behind on quota,
âJust focus on closing!â

Here's my analogy for that.

That's like standing in a kitchen, feeling hungry, and someone walks by eating
a warm, crumbly, delicious scone and they say, âJust make a scone!â and
you think, âIâd love toâ¦ how?"

Well, there's a specific set of ingredients that all add up into the finished
product. And just like you canât try baking a sconeâs ingredients first,
then mixing them after, there's a sequence. Plus, if you try to turn up the
heat to bake (close) faster, youâll just burn your scones (buyers).

(Whatâs with the strange scone analogy you ask? Well, dear reader, Iâm
drafting this blog post with my thumbs on an iPhone, on an 11 hour flight home
from Copenhagen with a dead laptop, after eating an incredible scone in the
airport. And Iâm hungry, wishing I bought a second.)

### 3/ Shape your message when decisions are being made.

Out of all the skills above, there are two that rise above and influence close
rates the most:

  1. Building and testing committed champions.
  2. Building a compelling narrative.

The reason is that every âmicroâ decision thatâs made throughout the
buying process will happen during internal meetings â not sales meetings.
[Without sales reps in the room](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-
enterprise-sales-playbook).

During the conversations that happen about you, without you.

Which makes controlling your message, especially when youâre not directly
sitting at the proverbial decision table, key. And entirely possible when you
focus on winning in writing.

Like we covered in [The Build Loop](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-build-test-
loop-how-to-create-an-insanely-committed-champion-while-co-creating-business-
cases), you'll do this by creating champions, by creating a written [business
case](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-one-page-business-case):

[](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-one-page-business-case)

### 4/ Measure and manage your personal tipping point.

The tipping point is when new gains in pipeline coverage require too much of
your TEA to manage, so you experience too large of a drop in close rates and
average contract values.

This is entirely personal to you, because itâs based on factors like your
level:

  * Deal complexity
  * Skill & experience
  * Style & energy

The tipping points for someone in mid-market vs. enterprise will be different.
As are the tipping points for a first year seller, and someone whoâs sold
for a decade.

Now, hereâs why this is a powerful idea.

When I was catching up with a friend, [Justin
Hastings](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-hastings-596b9420/), a Strategic
AE, he shared how he had his pick of 30 enterprises to fill out his target
account list at the start of last year. **Then, he did something most reps
would call crazy:**

> I took the top 7 accounts I felt were a good match after some deep research,
> and I gave away all the others to other reps. Sure, I could have kept all
> 30, but I knew I didnât have the bandwidth to run a quality process like I
> wanted to across more than 7.  
>  
> In fact, I went so deep on 3 accounts, with over 100 meetings in a year
> inside one company, that I blew my annual number out of the water after just
> closing that one deal alone.  
>

Get this. That massive deal he referenced?Â

That took 4-5 meetings a week, every week, during a 4-month POC phase. Which
just wouldn't have been possible while trying to work 30+ accounts.

My comment to him after?

_"You might as well be on their payroll as an internal consultant. You
probably knew more about their business than most employees."_

So, why did Justin make the call to âgive awayâ other accounts? He knows
his tipping point.

He knew he could increase his ACV and close rate to a point, which outweighed
the gains of a few (or many) more accounts in his target list.

**So how do you measure and manage to your tipping point?**

  1. Add up how much time you invest per deal, in each stage. We'd track this in a good old [timesheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KWDeHlt1UN26Xg_chQsdcMu99PKe2vdhMhRMxf81Soo/edit?usp=sharing), similar to how consultants track time spent on different projects. But you can use tools like [Timeular](https://timeular.com/) to make this an easier process.  
â

  2. Once you get a baseline, start to [drive toward zero time selling, as Andy Paul says.  

](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-library-of-uncommon-sales-
practices#spend-zero-time-selling)Andy's point is that as you start to sharpen
your sales skills and process, you'll drive down the time you need to manage
an opportunity. Which also means you'll start to operate below your tipping
point â and _then,_ you can increase the total number of opportunities.  

Adding opportunities in that moment is how you'll drive more revenue.
