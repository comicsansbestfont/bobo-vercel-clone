Letâs say youâre having a picnic by a river. A lovely spread of brie, fig,
and rosemary crackers. But suddenly, you hear a panicked noise coming from the
water:Â

A sheep is bobbing in the water, trying to stay afloat in the rapids. _âOh
my gosh,â_ without thinking, you sprint from your crackers, dive in, grab
the sheep, and swim it to shore.Â

But before you catch your breath, _another_ sheep is floating down the
rapids.Â

You jump back in, and _another_ sheep appears. So you holler for your friend
to come help, but you see them running up the shoreline. _âWhere the heck
are you going!?â_ you holler. So they holler back:Â

 _âIâm going upstream to find out why these sheep keep falling in!âÂ_

Turns out, the bridge upriver had a giant, sheep-sized hole in. A set of
planks needed to be repaired, so the sheep kept falling through while
crossing. (This was adapted from a public health parable.)

The point for sales teams?Â

â**Solving revenue problems âdownstreamâ is rarely the answer.**

Itâs exhausting, and impossible to get ahead. Plus, itâs expensive. One
problem solved upstream kills off 10 problems that no longer need to be
solved.

Thereâs a better way:

Designing a âlayeredâ playbook that solves downstream problems, one stage
earlier. Hereâs how:

  1. Isolate [your biggest pipeline dropoff](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-and-why-to-ditch-the-old-3x-coverage-ratio-rule). Where do the deals you already spent time and money to generate die off?  

  2. Identify what _should_ be happening (but isnât) to prevent that fallout.   

  3. Tie in a âplayâ or [framework](https://www.fluint.io/framework-library) to the stage _before_ that, to guide how your team executes.  

  4. Repeat 1 â 3 until you have a series of plays that feed into each other, starting upstream.

## **Stack-Ranking Pipeline Problems by Stage Age & Rate**

If you run the steps above, youâll end up with a grid that looks like this:

Itâs [a simple view](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-radically-simplify-
your-2025-sales-playbook-with-2-questions), but it means multiple roles in the
revenue organization all rowing together:

  * RevOps: âWhatâs changing in our data?âÂ 
  * Enablement: âWhat do we do differently?â
  * Managers: âAre we doing it?âÂ 

Create this, and look at changes in the data on a weekly or monthly basis
(depending on velocity).

Now, hereâs a few callouts on the example above. Revenueâs leaking from
the pipeline in:

  1. **Stage 2:** our**** conversion drops after pushing a high % of S1 deals through. We got locked into a small set of technical contacts, and arenât getting wider to validate the problem in S2 criteria.  

  2. **Stage 3:** our lowest stage-to-stage %. Our championâs messaging doesnât map their focus back to an exec priority. So we donât have enough âdecision weightâ to back a major change.  

  3. **Stage 6:** our conversion is solid, but deals sit for 54 days in the paper process, without much urgency to escalate a faster resolution.Â 

And, notice how an upstream fix starts to flow through the downstream problem:

  * Our problem framing is far too technical to resonate âhigh and wide.â  

  * So first, weâre going to focus on a written **problem statement.**  

  * That problem statement guides discovery on the â**Big 3** ,â numbers, names, dates:   

A high-cost shown with customer data (numbers), with impact against a priority
(named project), thatâs growing worse â and needs to be solved by a
specific date.  

  * That high-priority problem lays the foundation for an **exec-summary-style business case** , thatâll be shared with **a forwardable email.**   

  * With deeper executive engagement, and an anchor date, we can build out **an action plan** to cut time in Stage 6.Â 

Now, weâve got a playbook built around a simple set of frameworks that flow
together, looking something like this:

each stage.Â

Then, heâll write each with your deal championâs own voice from

## **A Case Study for AEâs: How Expedia Slashed Support Costs**

The art of writing an effective problem statement for your prospects isnât
too different.

It takes upstream thinking, and reframing the way an issueâs first
presented.Â

Hereâs an example of this, told by Ryan OâNeill, the former Head of
Customer Experience at Expedia as part of an interview with the Heath
Brothers. Itâs all about how he cut a high volume of customer support
requests _upstream_.Â

Heâd been looking at data from their call center:  

  * For every 100 customers booking travel, 58 contacted support for help after.Â 
  * Which meant that Support fielded 20M customer calls annually.
  * At a cost of roughly $5 per call, that left a $100M/year issue.
  * Which was growing, as more and more customers opted to book travel online.

Naturally, Support leaders were asking, _How do we cut time-to-resolution from
10 minutes to 2 minutes?_ Â

Which would cut their cost per call from $5, to $1. Shrinking the total cost
of an inefficient call center.

**But what if that wasnât the problem?** What if there was an altogether
different problem to solve?Â

Turns out, there was:Â

** _Why was Expedia getting so many calls in the first place?Â_**

The challenge is nobody actually owned _that_ problem.Â

Expedia was aware of the massive call volumes, for sure. But everyone was
tasked with a different problem: Marketing generated leads, product turned
them into bookings, and support answered calls after booking. But nobody was
working to prevent calls in the first place. Until OâNeill took his data to
Dara Khosrowshahi, Expediaâs CEO, who attached preventing customer calls to
his top priority.

As they looked into what drove call volumes, they realized most requests came
from people needing their itinerary. It wasnât getting through to their
email, and there wasnât an easy way to download it.

After framing and then fixing the _right_ problem, call volume plummeted from
58%, to 15%.Â

**Now, notice how these two different ways of framing the problem set up two
different approaches:**

> _(Problem #1)Â Slow resolution means high cost-per-call  
> (Approach #1)Â Faster call resolution reduces costs_

Versus:  

> _(Problem #2)Â High call volume from itinerary requests  
> (Approach #2) Cut call volume by making itineraries accessible_

Along with OâNeillâs work to frame the problem around a company-level
priorityâstopping calls from happening in the first place, not just handling
them fasterâhe did the work to _measure_ the problem. Raising the stakes to
a point Expedia had to âjump.âÂ

**Hereâs a simple, two-part framework for writing this out:**

> _Every [ frequency ], at least [ reach ] are experiencing [ pain ], costing
> us [ loss ]. If itâs not addressed by [ timeline ], that means [
> consequence ]._

Applied to Expedia, this reads like:Â

>  _Every month, at least 1.67M customers canât find their itinerary and
> have to call support, costing $8.35M to resolve these requests.  
>  
>  If itâs not addressed by the end of the year, that means weâll see
> another $500M in lost, repeat purchase revenue from frustrated customers
> opting out of our loyalty program._

This is the âbadâ outcome. The not-so-happy ending.Â

**But notice something here:Â**

Weâre not just talking about the cost of support tickets. Thatâs a 1st-
order effect. We also need to connect this into the 2nd- and 3rd-order effects
with customers:

  1. **1st Level** : âWeâre paying $100M per year in support costs.â  

  2. **2nd Level** : âCustomers arenât enrolling into our loyalty program, and even opting out because of their experience.â

  3. **3rd Level** : âOur customer lifetime value (CLTV) increases with loyalty members making repeat purchases, so now, weâre missing out on $500M in additional revenue.â

You can even play that out another level, saying that sales and marketing
spend is inflating their cost to acquire more first-time customers (CAC), to
offset lost loyalty revenue.Â  
Which is _really_ throwing off their unit economics: paying even more, for
customers who will spend even less.

Applied to a simple definition of âvalueâ:

> _Value = good outcomes (-) bad outcomes_

If weâre measuring a problem through Support Cost, CLTV, and CAC, then our
next step is to flip those numbers upside down, to message the good outcomes
(after solving the problem) using the _exact same metrics_.Â

**Which sets up a clear âbeforeâ versus âafterâ comparison.**

If Expedia dropped call volumes from 58% to 15% of bookings, theyâre saving
almost $75M per year in support costs. Plus, theyâre saving an estimated
$500M in future, repeat loyalty purchases.Â

Creating a total project value of roughly $575M.
