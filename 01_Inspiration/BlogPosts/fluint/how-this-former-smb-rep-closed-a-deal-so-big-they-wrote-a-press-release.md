Last month, Rick SabÃ³ia landed a deal so large, his customer and company
issued a press release. Itâs the kind of deal enterprise sellers can spend a
career working for.

And get this:

He was an âSMB repâ at the time.

Hereâs how it all happened. And **exactly how you can do the same.

## How it All Started: From Brazil to the US

7 years ago, Rick sold everything, moved to the US, and started his career in
sales:

Hereâs what Rick said during our last conversation.

> My dad was a pharmaceutical rep, so I figured Iâd go into medicine. But I
> hated biology and chemistry. Then, when I had the chance to come to the US,
> I stumbled across an opportunity to sell PCI compliance in Portuguese.  
>  
> After I got started, I remember dreaming that I was talking to people in
> English, and they could actually understand me. Iâd wake up from those
> dreams feeling super excited.  
>  
> I fell in love with sales pretty quickly after this, and remember this
> feeling that becoming an enterprise seller was my goal, but it felt so
> unattainable.

Over the next few few years, Rick worked his way through different Utah-based
sales teams, ultimately landing an AE role selling employee recognition
software.

## How Things Progressed: From SMB â National Rollout

When Rick got started in his new role, he went DEEP on the process of becoming
a thoughtful, strategic seller.

First, he read everything he could find in this blog,
[pclub.io](https://go.pclub.io/selling-with-champions), and [_Selling
With_](https://www.amazon.com/Selling-champions-internal-conversations-
enterprise-ebook/dp/B0CJQXSNF2/) _._

Then, he [signed up for Fluint](https://www.fluint.io/video/fluint-demo-and-
product-walkthrough) in summer 2023.

Which helped him shift the way he thought about selling. The process of:

  1. Creating [committed champions in every deal](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-enterprise-sales-playbook#part-2-the-deal-champion-job-description).
  2. Enabling them to sell internally with [a compelling narrative](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-in-enterprise-sales-how-to-craft-internal-narratives).
  3. Designing his [process around influencing buying conversations.](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-business-case-is-the-sales-process)

After another 6 months, hereâs the DM I got from Rick inside the [Fluint
Slack Community](https://www.fluint.io/community):

Rickâs deal started with a single location, but he expanded the scope to
_all 800 locations._

I was stoked to see the news, and of course, I was curious about the story
behind the deal:

Hereâs what Rick shared in our conversation after these messages.

## Rickâs Top 3 Takeaways for Building Deal Momentum

âI think there were three main ideas that really made the biggest
difference. They were all about helping me build up momentum, so things
didnât stall out.â

### 1/ Developing a Highly âBelievableâ Message

By default, buyers are skeptical. So Rick focused on finding the right
messenger, and ârentingâ his championâs track record & internal
influence:

âI [had never been a buyer before](https://www.fluint.io/post/nonobvious-
lessons-from-sales-reps-buying-for-the-first-time), so I didnât always see
the dynamics at play in large deals. Previously, I thought anyone willing to
talk to me qualified as a champion.â

This time around, he realized a championâs influence comes in varying
degrees.

Itâs a spectrum, that will rise and fall based on someoneâs
âbelievability.â

Which acts like a discount rate when your message is attached to them, vs.
another contact.

For example, letâs say:

  * Contact #1 was personally recruited by an executive after working with them in the past.
  * Contact #2 led a past train wreck of a project, so the exec never staffs them on projects.

Who do you want championing your deal?

### 2/ Climbing Above the Priority Filter

We live in an Attention Economy.

Which means budget flows where your buyersâ attention goes. It also means
your competition is all the noise and competing priorities inside the
organization.

Itâs hard (like, really hard) to get a deal to rise up the [level of an
executive](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-craft-executive-level-points-of-
view-frameworks-for-strategic-reps).

Let alone a board of directors. Which is exactly what Rick realized:

âPeople put so much emphasis on âpain points,â and I thought identifying
and even measuring pain was sufficient. But I learned that [framing the pain
in a more strategic way](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-
enterprise-sales-playbook#craft-a-compelling-problem-
statement:~:text=Charles%20Muhlbauer.-,Framing%20the%20Problem,-How%20you%20and),
to align with a major initiative within the business, is really the key.

We had to [revise our
narrative](https://story.screenspace.io/fluint/businesscase) so many times I
lost count. Until eventually, it resonated and caught the board's
attention.â

### 3/ Leveraging the Business Case to Multithread

A deal this large means lots of meetings. With lots of contacts, and lots of
approvals.

Hereâs Rickâs point:

âThe Credit Union space is very network-centric, so it was key to get
validation from other executives and business units if we were going to move
this deal forward.â

He not only had to [multithread](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-
multithread-navigate-dysfunctional-buying-groups-in-enterprise-sales) at a
whole new level, he had to:

## How Itâs Going Today: From AE â Head of Sales

Rickâs level of experience jumped forward by a few years, in just a few
months.

So when I shared out the press release inside
[Slack](https://www.fluint.io/community), people noticed:

Shortly after this, Rick became the new Head of Sales at ScreenSteps.

He started in January, but the story doesnât end there. Rick didnât _just_
become a strategic seller, and a Head of Sales.

The best news of all?

Heâs now the proud dad to a new son (his second son):

I love this last point from Rick:

Sales keeps me at my best. Not just at work, but at home too. Itâs a field
where Iâm always working to grow, improve, and learn, and I hope itâs
something my sons see.

Thereâs zero doubt in my mind Rickâs sons are already looking up to their
dadâs journey.

From Brazil, to the US.

From SMB, to Enterprise.

From AE, to Head of Sales.

I canât wait to see whatâs next for Rick and his family.
