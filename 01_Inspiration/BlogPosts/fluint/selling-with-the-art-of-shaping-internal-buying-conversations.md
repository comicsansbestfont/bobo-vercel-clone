## I made something for you.  

For ~45 Saturday mornings in a row, I sat on my couch with a cup of French
press and a plate full of waffles. Between sips and bites, I wrote down all I
know about selling.  

**More specifically: the idea of selling "with" buyers, not to them.**  

Itâs what I spend all day, every day, thinking about and experimenting with.  

The outcome of all that caffeine, maple syrup, and my last decade+ of selling
is this:

Every line inside this book will help you create and sell with champions.  

So you can shape the internal buying conversations happening about you â
without you.  

**Which is where deals are actually won and lost.**

It's a way to sell that makes complex deals a bit easier. And more
importantly, more fun.

**Itâs available November 8th, and you can**[**(pre)order it
here.**](https://www.amazon.com/Selling-champions-internal-conversations-
enterprise-ebook/dp/B0CJQXSNF2/)

I thought about doing a promo where you get free waffles with every pre-order.
But logistically, itâs a little too hard to pull off.

But hereâs what you will get out of it:

A wildly practical guide to landing the largest deals of your career. While
having a whole lot of fun doing it.

Including detailed breakdowns on every practice I've figured out the hard way.
The practices most every sales training just isnât talking
about.[â](https://www.amazon.com/Selling-champions-internal-conversations-
