"No champion, no deal," is a mantra that elite sellers live by.

That's because in a complex, enterprise-level sale, there can easily be a
dozen different stakeholders, each with their own set of competing priorities
and busy schedules. All of which adds up to a lot of inertia working against a
new deal.

A champion â someone with both power and influence inside the buying circle
â can help you create momentum when youâre hitting inertia. But how do you
know if your contact is a true champion?

## The Make-or-Break in High-Value Deals

This past week, I sat down with [Ayan
Dutta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/duttaayan/) to get his take on developing
deal champions. Ayan is a curious, former startup co-founder leading
enterprise sales at MongoDB. We got to talking about this idea and his list of
[uncommon sales practices](https://medium.com/@ayandutta/uncommon-sales-
practices-part-1-cacbf33cec0b).

At the top of his list is âTesting Champions.â Ayan pointed out that
building champions is one step. Even more important is _testing_ them to
determine how committed they are.

A true champion can move mountains. But take a minute, and look at the
accounts in your pipeline. Find every deal you believe you have a champion
for. On a scale of 1 - 10, how confident are you that each champion is
actively helping close that deal?

Hereâs how Ayan says you can make sure youâre at a 10/10.

## 5 Ways to Determine if Youâve Built a Committed Champion

As Ayan shared more about his work at MongoDB, we talked through a shortlist
of ways to test champions. The fun thing about each test is, when done well,
it adds to the relationship. It creates a new commitment in a sort of self-
reinforcing build/test loop.

### 1\. Develop more intimate communication channels.

We email with people weâve never met. We Slack our team. We text family and
friends. Each medium is increasingly more personal and private. If youâre
texting/slacking with a prospect, youâve expanded out of professional trust
and into personal trust. Make sure youâre moving into more personal
communications with care.

### 2\. Have champions present during key meetings.

Final decision makers are more likely to trust their team, who theyâve
worked with, over an AE they just met. If youâve converted a key player on
their team into your champion, ask them to [present your business
case](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-ultimate-executive-level-
presentation-deck), in their words, during closing conversations.

Champions often feel the pain youâre solving the most, so they should
articulate your value the best. Ayan and I both agreed â weâve never seen
more passionate moments than when a champion is selling to the C-Suite.

### 3\. Ask champions to layout their buying process.

Prospects want to buy how their organizations buys, not how you sell. If a
champion has led the buying process in the past, they should be able to detail
everything from decision criteria, key players to persuade, and steps unique
to their approvals process.

A committed champion wonât hesitate to layout the treasure map for you.
Someone whoâs on the fence will hold that information close to the vest.

### 4\. Assign action items, like calling customer references, to your
champion.

Weâre all busy. But we always make time for whatâs most important to us.
Assign your champion an action item that will help you discern where on their
priority list you fall.

The best kind of test is one that adds value to your counterpart, and one that
gives you a clear, black-or-white measure of whether or not they followed
through. Examples can include calling a customer reference, sharing data for
your business case, or [crafting a problem
statement](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-build-a-compelling-problem-
statement-case-study) for an internal memo.

### 5\. Flip your roles in the conversation.

Your champion will, no doubt, be involved in conversations about you without
you.

So flip the script and ask them to share how theyâll communicate your value
during an internal meeting. Ask them to share their true, unfiltered opinions.
If your champion is willing to listen to some coaching, going deep into the
ins-and-outs of your product to be ready for questions or objections, you know
youâve built a solid champion.
