Jeff Bezos described his decision making model of âone-wayâ and âtwo-
wayâ doors in a [1997 letter to
shareholders](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm):

> Some decisions are consequential and irreversible â one-way doors â and
> these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great
> deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and donât like what you
> see on the other side, you canât get back to where you were before. **We
> can call these Type 1 decisions.** â

He goes on to say:

> But most decisions arenât like that â they are changeable, reversible
> â theyâre **two-way doors**. If youâve made a suboptimal Type 2
> decision, you donât have to live with the consequences. You can reopen the
> door and go back through. **Type 2 decisions can and should be made
> quickly** by high judgment individuals or small groups.

He was putting language behind the way most executives think. They spend _a
lot_ of time analyzing big decisions. Think of Bezosâ model like this:

Hereâs the rub for sellers:

  * The larger the deal, the more irreversible & consequential it _seems_.
  * This makes for long cycles, with lots of research and evaluation.

Coupled with all the [bureaucracy](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-inner-life-
of-the-enterprise-10-concepts-for-developing-large-deals) in big companies,
itâs like trying to drive a deal forward with the parking brake on. Momentum
stalls, warning lights flash.

Bezos agrees:

> As organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-
> weight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions, including many Type
> 2 decisions. The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion,
> failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention.
> **Weâll have to figure out how to fight that tendency.**

**This means your job is to enable a fast yet thoughtful decision, by turning
what buyers see as a Type 1 decision, into a Type 2 decision.**

A concrete way to do this is with creative contract structures. Hereâs an
example of how Sir Richard Branson created a âreversibleâ contract:

> When we launched Virgin Atlantic I made a deal with Boeing that we could
> hand the plane back in a year's time if the airline didn't get off the
> ground. Thankfully, we never had to. But if the things hadn't worked out, I
> could have walked back through the door.

Basically, his contract could be reversed if he didn't get his airline "off
the ground."

A great deal for Virgin Galactic. Fraught with issues for sales reps â like
clawbacks if a deal is reversed. So hereâs a better alternative we'll
unpack:**Â**

**A focus on _expansion_ termsÂ instead of _extinction_ terms.**

This post will show you a non-traditional proof-of-concept (POC) framework
that takes risk off the table, leads to fast expansion deals, and helps buyers
see your deal as a âType 2â decision.  
â

## **Why This POC Framework is Crazy Effective**

[The JOLT Effect](https://sellingsherpa.com/index.php/2022/09/29/the-jolt-
effect-book-summary/) recently put data behind why this process has been crazy
effective for me and my teams. JOLT sellers:

  * (J)udge Indecision: an ability to buy must be paired with an ability to decide.
  * (O)ffer a Recommendation: Buyers who are indecisive need guidance. Not choices.
  * (L)imit the Exploration: Shared more information can become counterproductive.
  * (T)ake Risk Off the Table: The [cost of inaction](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-build-a-compelling-problem-statement-case-study) needs to be measured. But to move forward, go beyond costs by removing downside risk.

Hereâs the difference this approach makes:

If the JOLT framework is a conceptual wrapper, think of this process as the
candy inside. A way to sweeten your deal, and get rid of risk and regretâs
bitter aftertaste.  
â

## The typical POC is just a paid trial.

Which makes it a losing strategy. The belief is that buyers need **more**
information, **more** access, and **more** experience in the product to help
them decide.

That product access often comes with:

  * Way too broad of a scope
  * An ambiguous timeline
  * No defined goals

Just as the JOLT framework shows, this is the **_opposite_** of what you want.
Instead of âlimiting exploration,â youâre opening Pandoraâs Box.

Plus, it does little to de-risk a decision. In fact, it often highlights just
how different life will be with your product, which isnât always good. Lots
of change = uncertainty. Uncertainty = fear.  
â

## The Framework for Winning POC's

Every POC has 5 basic elements to it:

  * Scope
  * Timeline
  * Hypothesis
  * Measurables
  * Next Steps

**Effective POCâs combine these elements into a structure that delivers:**

  1. The least amount of activity
  2. Over the shortest period of time
  3. Focused on a single big uncertainty
  4. To lower perceived risk and barriers to change
  5. And end with a clear go/no-go condition.

**1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = more revenue, in less time.  
**

Letâs break down each part of this framework.  
â

### (1 + 2) POC's Should Require Minimal Effort

Short and fast POCs are best. Not just for your sales cycle, theyâre an
easier initial ask for your buyers. So itâs worth highlighting that Iâm
not using the term âPilotâ here.

**Pilots and POCâs arenât the same thing:**

  * POCâs strip out 80% of a productâs scope to focus on a small subset of activities.
  * Pilots are a _full_ product rollout, but only to a subset of customers or users in a test market.

Most POCâs are over-engineered. Thereâs too much activity. Youâll scale
them down when you force constraints into the equation. With a timeline, for
example, which can lead you to ask:

> _What must be true to do this in less than < timeline, e.g. 2 weeks >?_

You might use dummy data instead of live customer data, and cut out all
âETLâ activities.

How youâll arrive at the least amount of activity over the shortest period
of time is also linked to your hypothesis â  
â

### **(3 + 4) POCs Should be Narrow & Focused**

The major reframe here is shifting from viewing POCâs as a trial, to a
rapid, contained experiment thatâs based on a **specific** hypothesis. This
is literally in the name.Â  _Proof_ of concept. But itâs often skipped over.

  * Most POCs start with the product. âWhat features should we include?â
  * This process starts with the customer, by asking, âWhy havenât they changed already?â

This is an actual question you should ask your champions, by the way. Then:

  * Continue asking the full buying team until you find a pattern.
  * Create consensus on a single perceived risk driving the indecision.
  * Develop an experiment to prove a hypothesis, focused on that risk.

**This approach lets you conduct 20% of the trial activity to dispel 80% of
the doubts.**

It also means every POCÂ should look unique. Because the perceived riskÂ at
the root of a customerâs indecision varies. (Yet most teams run the same
process. They just swap datasets.)

**The basic hypothesis is structured in a sentence like this:**

> If < this condition is true >, then < a reasonable conclusion >.

Then, your experiment should narrowly focus on proving out whether that
condition is true, or false, and if led to the the conclusion. Which leads us
into the last step of the framework.  
â

### (5) POCs Should End in Clear Go/No-Go Conditions

This is where youâll use hypotheticals to talk about if/then scenarios with
the buying team:

> âIf weâre able to show X, then weâll want to move forward with Y."

> "But if we only show Z, weâll agree we donât have enough evidence to
> rule out the main risks to moving forward.â

**There are two key points here:**

  * **âXâ is your proof.**  
Something measurable shown during your POC, showing that the best case
scenario is now the most likely scenario. Reducing risk, and [raising your
projectâs Expected Value](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-cfos-evaluate-
deals-3-things-you-need-to-design-finances-dream-
deal#:~:text=3/%20Risk%20Appetite%20Can%20Kill%20Deals%2C%20Fast).  
â

  * **âYâ are commercial terms.**  
You need to define the specifics of âYâ upfront. This prevents you from
having to sell twice. Which the typical POC forces by delaying expansion
discussions until after it's delivered.

**Two more notes on defining âX.â**

  * Make sure the buying team drives how âXâ is defined. [Expectation Bias](https://www.notion.so/8497304a9d2b4d8d99aa2fc37983c14c) leads us to gather data that supports our beliefs, and deny the data that doesnât.  
â

  * Once X is defined, ask, _âIf we hit this goal, and youâre NOT confident moving forward, why would that be?â_ Whatever they say is the **actual** risk your proof points should address.

**Alright, with X and Y defined, you now have two possible scenarios:**

  1. **Go:** The end condition under which these expansion terms kick in.
  2. **No-Go:** A bad or âjust okayâ result. Not enough to move forward.

All thatâs left is to âhardwireâ these go/no-go scenarios into your
agreement. Which can be as simple as adding an attachment into your MSA with
conditional language:

  * If < X > is delivered by < date >, then < Y > terms are triggered.
  * If < X > is **not** delivered by < date >, the agreement terminates.

The term âhardwiringâ comes from the idea of creating permanent features
inside a computer, by physically connecting circuits. So they canât be
altered by the software itâs running. So, ifâ¦

  * Indecision strikes in the readout after a flawless POC
  * A key contact or an executive suddenly leaves the org
  * A current provider says, "50% off! Sign the renewal!"

â¦ youâve already helped your champion hardwire in their expansion upfront.
It's now a permanent feature of their POC experience.

**By the way, I was skeptical of this at first.** Nervous itâd create too
much friction to even get a POC going. But Jonathan, a very smart rep on a
past team, pushed me on this.

He wanted this for his deals, and Iâm so glad he did, because I discovered
it's a gift for champions. You see, [**champions _want_ your POCs to
scale**](https://www.notion.so/006304a039d34564a47e8ec431c75a9e)**.** They
_donât_ want more negotiation, procurement, etc. The more time they spend on
their day jobs with a solution, the better.

It may add in a few weeks into your evaluation and negotiation process
upfront. But itâs well worth it, because afterwards:

  * You have a single decision process to navigate.
  * You can fully focus on hitting your POC goals.
  * Youâll roll right into expansion after.

##  
Use this Framework for Your POC Readout.

To be clear, hardwired expansion terms donât mean your deal is guaranteed.
You still need to:

  1. Partner with your account team to ensure you hit your âGoâ condition.
  2. Hold a âreadout.â [An exec-level meeting](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-avoid-screwing-up-executive-level-sales-meetings) to update everyone on progress.

### A Case Study in Digital Commerce

Hereâs an example based on one of our past deals. We were working with the
digital innovation team at a global cosmetics company.

A company whose primary sales channel before COVID-19 struck was retail.
Customers would walk into a store and try on makeup to see how each product
looked on their own, real-life skin.

**Almost overnight, that was impossible. Retail sales plummeted across every
market.**

(For context, Fortune 500 innovation teams used our platform to find startup
technologies they could quickly acquire, or integrate with. To launch new
products or enter new markets faster and more cheaply than they could do in-
house.)

Hereâs how our readout framework looked:

**1/ Recommendation:_â_**

** _Since weâve proven_** _[1] the time-to-market for a US-based, virtual
lipstick try-on is roughly 3 months_** _faster_** _than an internal
build,_**_we should_** _[2] expand platform access for project areas across
the full portfolio of brands._

**2/ Context:**_â_

 _[3] The drop in retail sales from COVID-19 has created_** _a significant
revenue gap_** _compared to project earnings of [4] (redacted)._

_To address this by [5] the end of Q3, we decided_** _the best course of
action_** _is engaging with [6] emerging AR/VR technologies that were
previously vetted by VC partners._

**3/ Complication:**_  

Yet, [7] an early-stage companyâs ability to safely integrate with and
handle the volume of our eCommerce site_** _presented a risk_** _to [8]
leveraging outside technology._

_So we structured [9]_**_a single-product test_** _in the US market, to prove
we could create [10] a faster time-to-market when introducing new tech to the
customer experience._ â

**4/ Conclusions:**  

_We were able to [11] stand up a new customer experience_** _in less than 8
weeks_** _,_**_therefore_** _, weâre confident in continuing to
[12]_**_expand our approach_** _across our product portfolio._
