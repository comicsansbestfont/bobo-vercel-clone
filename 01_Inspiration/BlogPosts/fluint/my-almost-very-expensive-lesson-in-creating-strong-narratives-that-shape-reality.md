Hereâs a screenshot of one of our investors texting me last week:

We were on a team retreat, so I got his heads up late in the day. Right after,
I started transferring a chunk of cash from an SVB account, over to another
account...

...but the wire got hung up. It didn't clear last Thursday.

Now, you already know the end to this story. Our team (and others) got all of
our cash back. And yes, I know. Youâve read opinions galore on this topic.

But Iâm not here to opine on why this happened, or how companies should
manage their cash.

**Instead, I write and think and teach and build products that are centered on
the power of narratives everyday. I strongly believe in the power
of**[**narratives**](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-
in-enterprise-sales-how-to-craft-internal-narratives)**.** **So naturally, I
found the SVB meltdown as fascinating as it was horrifying.**

Narratives are powerful enough to create the second-largest bank failure in
recent history. And theyâre powerful enough to shape the direction of
massive, global enterprises too.

Here are 6 takeaways from last week you should put to work in your pipeline
this week.  
â

### 1/ **Narratives Create New Realities**

Narratives shape perception, and perception becomes reality when a message
gains a certain level of widespread acceptance.

  * **The reality on Wednesday of last week:  
â**SVB was fairly well-capitalized. Their balance sheet wasnât outside of
federal guidelines.  
â

  * â**Their messaging changed that reality:  
** They shared a press release that drove people to behave differently,
pulling their cash, which dramatically changed the facts. In 24 hours, their
balance sheet was NOT healthy.  
â

### 2/ **Narratives Create Decision Safety**

After a certain level of âsocial consensus,â itâs safer to do what the
crowd does than to stay the course. Even if you donât agree.

Once a herd stampedes, youâre safer running with them than standing still
(and getting trampled). **Some call this a narrativeâs âBandwagon
Effect.â**

As a semi-comical example, check out this video of cafe goers in Brazil. There
was a CrossFit class running on the sidewalk as part of their workout. A few
people spotted them, and thought something was wrong.

Like, why would people be running away?_âOthers seems to be running for
their lifeâ¦ I probably should too. This isnât good.â_

Thereâs safety in moving as the group does. So narratives build momentum
based on what others are doing.

### 3/ Narratives Grow Stronger or Weaker Based on their Messenger

Peter Thiel is a big name in tech. Most founders have read his book **_Zero to
One._** His VC fund, Founders Fund, is a Tier 1, respected firm. So when you
see a headline like this, the message snowballs real quick:  
â

Thatâs why your message can be branded as âvisionaryâ when delivered by
an SVP, but the same message will get dismissed as too âfoolishâ when
shared by an Analyst.

So whoâs delivering your message internally? What level of social capital
has your champion built up? How âbelievableâ are they?  
â

### 4/ Narratives Create Decision Speed

SVB shared they were selling off a few investments at a loss on March 8th at
4pm. Less than 48 hours later, they were shut down by the FDIC.

Everyone knows (and complains) that enterprise deals move slowly. But thatâs
only because [your narrative isnât
connected](https://www.fluint.io/resources/enterprise-sales-lessons-inside-a-
leaked-facebook-memo) to a massive, unaddressed problem blocking a [central
leadership priority](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-sell-priorities-not-
problems-5-steps-to-shift-your-messaging). When you align your message
accordingly, things happen. Fast.

###  
5/ Simple **Narratives Travel**

A message thatâs too complex and filled with jargon is carrying too much
extra baggage. It wonât get to liftoff, and wonât travel around the
enterprise when itâs weighed down.

**The message, âYouâre going to lose all your cash, fast,â is pretty
dang simple.**

Itâs why [Dave Kellogg says](https://kellblog.com/2012/01/17/the-one-key-to-
dealing-with-senior-executives-answer-the-question/) executives this way:

> _They're direct. They speak clearly and in simple language. Buzzwords and
> spin are the province of middle management, not the C-suite._

So cut out the clutter. Simplify your language to help your ideas travel.  
â

### 6/ Effective **Narratives Are Emotionally Relevant**

My friend [Kyle Asay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyleasay/) pointed out Â
good reps, âSpeak to the emails buyers never want to read.â

For example, if youâre in HR, itâs a massive compliance issue. IT, itâs
a data breach. And if youâre a founder, itâs an email (or text) saying all
your cash is evaporating.

Both scenarios strike a chord because theyâre
[vivid](https://www.fluint.io/post/win-in-writing-copywriting-shortcuts-to-
accelerate-enterprise-
deals#:~:text=securing%20customer%20feedback.\)-,6/%20Use%20vivid%20verbs.,-Look%20at%20the),
and emotionally relevant. They tap into a loss weâll desperately try to
avoid.  
â

Hereâs a shortcut to crafting narratives that spread:

  1. **Capture your buyers own words.  
â**What type of internal language do they use to describe the problem?  
â

  2. **Drop those words into an effective framework.**
