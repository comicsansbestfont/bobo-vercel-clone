In 1956, IKEA hit a breaking point.

The company had grown from Ingvar Kamprad's mail-order business to a showroom
in Sweden, but was struggling with a critical problem: furniture delivery
costs were eating into their margins, and pricing products beyond most
customersâ reach.

## **A big problem.**

So one cold morning, IKEA designer Gillis Lundgren arrived at their workshop
to photograph a LÃVET table for their upcoming catalog. He had attempted to
load the elegant, leaf-shaped table into his Volvoâ¦ but it wouldn't fit.

"I remember standing there, looking at this beautiful piece that was
essentially blocking our progress," Gillis later said. "We were already
running behind schedule, and I had the photographer waiting at the workshop."

So he figured, "Well what if I just take off the legs, and reassemble it
later?"

Which is what he did. Placing everything flat in his car, then reassembling it
at the photography studio.

When Ingvar saw his improvised solution, "He called me into his office,"
Lundgren shared years later.

> I thought he might be upset about modifying the product. Instead, he was
> energized, asking detailed questions about how much space we saved and how
> quickly I could reassemble it.

That evening, Ingvar gathered his small leadership team. On a simple notepad,
he wrote out the question that became their north star:

> _Why do we have to assemble furniture before shipping it?_

**Which was an altogether different way of framing the problem:**

  * Instead of a margin issue that asks, âHow do we cut our shipping rates?ââwhich is a matter of negotiating better fees and pricing with carriersâhe challenged a fundamental assumption about furniture production.  
â

  * Fundamentally transforming IKEA by using flatpacked furniture, to take up 80% less warehouse space, cut shipping costs, and afford lower prices for customers while maintaining their margins.

Just the same, the problems your prospects bring you arenât objective.
Theyâre subjective.

Which means changing the way you talk about the problem will change the way
they go about solving it.

Thatâs why top reps spend the majority of their time finding and (re)framing
the problem (to [align with the approach](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-
sell-priorities-not-problems-5-steps-to-shift-your-messaging#5-sell-the-
approach-before-selling-a-product) they uniquely enable).

## How to Find, Frame &Â Sell

Hereâs an example.

Letâs say weâre selling an AR/VR solution to IKEA, and based on our
research, we notice theyâre shifting toward a new, smaller footprint store
design.

As part of their push into into digital orders, not just in-store sales.

In this case, through some research and discovery conversations, we might come
to frame up the problem this way:

In short, the job is about:

  * Finding and framing a high-cost, high-priority problem.
  * Including multiple levels of cost (with the buying teamâs own data), and the impact against a company-wide priority.
  * Plus, why itâs getting worse over time, demanding a response now.
