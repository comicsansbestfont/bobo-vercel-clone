â _This post is Part 2 of âStuff sales leaders say that sounds helpful,
but itâs just not.â_

 _You can catch up on Part 1_[ _here_](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-
design-a-value-based-sale-and-drive-business-impact) _, which was all about
being told to â_[ _Sell value!_](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-design-a-
value-based-sale-and-drive-business-impact)_â_

___________________

Ever had a sales leader tell you, âBring a point of view?â If so, I agree.
Itâs what you should do.

The question is, what the heckâs a point of view? And how do you have one?

**Well over 90% of sellers get this idea wrong.**

Including reps spending hours researching execs. Because a POV isnât about
personalization.

(It has nothing to do with an executiveâs career history, alma matter, or
personal hobbies.)

It also has nothing to do with your product. Executives donât think about
your product.

Like, not at all. (They think about what they want to say to their board next
month.)

**Instead, a POV is a unique recommendation that backs**[**an executive
priority**](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-sell-priorities-not-
problems-5-steps-to-shift-your-messaging)**.**

Itâs a well-researched idea of [how youâll create
value](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-design-a-value-based-sale-and-drive-
business-
impact#:~:text=What%20%E2%80%9CSelling%20Value%E2%80%9D%20Actually%20Means).

And itâs a skillset youâll rely on while writing up a compelling business
case.  
â

## How to Craft Point of View

Crafting a POVÂ is about offering a credible recommendation for a complex
problem.

**Which happens by matching up a messy situation with a structured
framework.**

Itâs also more of an ongoing process than a point-in-time task.

Your POV will change as you go deeper in discovery. Which means that, while
you can craft an initial point of view with your account research, youâll
also want to develop the mental dexterity and business acumen to do this on
the fly.

The best way I know how to do this?

âCase Interviews.â  
â

## The Greatest Sales Training I Never Had

I havenât read 95% of the top sales books. Iâve never gone through a
formal sales training.

Instead, I learned how to sell âby analogy.âÂ Which isn't a new idea. In
fact:  
â

  * **Arnold Schwarzenneger** took ballet to improve his transitions and movements while posing.  
â

  * **Kobe Bryant** took tap dancing lessons to strengthen his ankles and increase his coordination on the court.

I didn't know it at the time, but this concept started for me after I hit a
point where I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my career. I figured
consulting would help me learn a lot and find out.

So I got a job building valuation models at a consulting firm, and to help me
get that job, my roommate spent countless hours drilling me with mock
âcases.â

In a single 90-minute sprint while sitting on our bunkbeds, weâd cover M&A
recommendations, expanding market share, calculating fair market value, etcâ¦
which was like doing 9 or 10 high-level discovery calls and business case
writing sessions, every single day.

Then, once I got that consulting job, I started building 100+ tab Excel models
for massive enterprises. Which also forced me to structure and clarify my
thinking.

It was easily the best sales training I never ever had, because it laid the
foundation I continue to use while writing up business cases years later.

So now, what exactly is a âcase?â

**Cases are structured ways of building up a POVÂ to guide executives. They
work by:**

  1. Giving you a small set of facts to start.
  2. If you ask the right questions, you get more data on the business problem.
  3. Then you match a framework to the situation, to understand whatâs wrong and how to fix it.
  4. Next, you develop a concise set of recommendations.
  5. Finally, you lay it all out in a concise narrative.

**This is the process of crafting a POV.**

This is also why now, whenever Iâm adding numbers into a business case, my
brain is trained to think in terms of:

  * Scenarios and sensitivities
  * Dependencies and drivers
  * Risks and tradeoffs

## The 5 Most Common Frameworks to Structure Your Point of View

The workbook I used for all this practice is called [Case in
Point](https://www.amazon.com/Case-Point-Complete-Interview-
Preparation/dp/0971015880). Countless consultants train with it. Most sellers
have never heard of it.

â**So here are 5 example consulting frameworks to draw on while crafting a
POV.**

If you can understand the basics of each, to match them up to the situation
your prospect is in, you'll standout.

You can also read practice cases fromÂ [BCG ](https://careers.bcg.com/case-
interview-
preparation#:~:text=Driving%20revenue%20growth%20at%20a%20healthcare%20company.)orÂ
[Bain](https://www.bain.com/careers/hiring-process/interviewing/fashion-case-
study/). And Iâll share a few examples of how these led me to the POV's in
two recent business cases I wrote.

**1/ Profitability Framework:**

  * **Revenue** : What drives each source of revenue, including price and quantity?
  * **Cost** : What are the major cost components for each product line?
  * **Volume** : Where and how much of each product line / services is sold?
  * **Competition** : How is the competitive landscape impacting profitability?

**2/ Market Entry Framework:**

  * **Market Size** : Whatâs the size of the target market?
  * **Market Growth** : Whatâs the growth rate and potential of the market?
  * **Market Share** : How much share can the customer actually achieve?
  * **Barriers to Entry** : What obstacles or challenges are there for entering the market?
  * **Profitability** : How profitable will entering the market be?

**3/ Mergers and Acquisitions (M &A) Framework:**

  * **Strategic Fit:** How compatible are the two companies' strategies?
  * **Financials:** Howâs each performing? Will merging improve the financials?
  * **Market Factors:** What market dynamics, competition, industry trends exist?
  * **Integration:** What challenges / opportunities will integrating two companies bring?
  * **Risks:** What risks will throw the process off track?

**4/ Pricing Framework:**

  * **Cost-Based Pricing:** Analyze costs, then add a markup on top.
  * **Competitor-Based Pricing:** Consider how much competitors are already charging, and how you can drive more differentiation.
  * **Value-Based Pricing:** Based on the perceived value of the product / service to customers.
  * **Elasticity:** Evaluate the price sensitivity of different customer segments.

**5/ Market Sizing Framework:**

  * **Top-Down Approach:** Start with the total market size, then narrow into the target segment.
  * **Bottom-Up Approach:** Estimate the # of potential customers + how much each will spend.
  * **Market Segmentation:** Break down the market into relevant segments.
  * **Assumptions:** Make a few logical assumptions to estimate market size.
  * **Cross-Verify:** With estimates from different approaches or data sources.

## Using Frameworks to Craft a Point of View

Hereâs how these types of frameworks will impact how your point of view
shows up whenâ¦

â¦using two examples from my own pipeline.  
â

### Profitability Framework: An HR Software Company

  * **Situation:** The companyâs working to command an attractive valuation during their next raise, and investors have been concerned with how quickly the companyâs burning cash.  
â

  * **Complication:** The company just introduced a new product line focused on âEarned Wage Access.â Not all CFOâs are familiar with the concept, and HR teams struggle to message it clearly. Thatâs creating longer sales cycles and lower win rates, so reps avoid selling it.  
â

  * **Recommendation:** Shift the mix of revenue to the higher-margin Earned Wages product line, to drive more profitable growth, by enabling HR champions with a written business case that simplifies the new product line's messaging for CFOâs.

â And yes, you guessed it.

â[Their sales team now uses Fluint](https://www.fluint.io/video/fluint-demo-
and-product-walkthrough) to create and collaborate on the written business
cases their HR champions present to Finance.

See how the message doesnât have to _directly_ focus on our product? But you
can still see how itâs tied in? Itâs about theÂ projectâshifting the mix
of revenueâenabling an executive priority.  
â

### M&A Framework in the Customer Engagement Space

  * **Situation:** Private equity acquired and merged three different customer engagement companies, to better compete against and take business from the industry giant.  
â

  * **Complication:** The one merged company is struggling to increase sales velocity. Reps stick to selling the product theyâre used to, and when they branch out, their messaging focuses on the tech. Thereâs no standardized sales framework to unite the different teams, either.  
â

  * **Recommendation:** Drive top line growth to beat acquisition targets, by winning the most highly-competitive deals (which also bring the largest multiyear contracts) by introducing a standard, âvalue-basedâ business case framework for all reps to build from.  
â

## Becoming a Strategic Seller (Even If Youâre Selling SMB)

Hereâs my bigger point behind crafting a point of view in each deal.

Becoming a strategic seller is **_not_** about selling:

  * With âEnterpriseâ or âStrategicâ in your title
  * Contract values with a lot of zeros in them
  * Companies with > 1,000 employees

Itâs about making this shift:

  1. Every Other Rep: Selling products that solve problems.
  2. Strategic Reps: Selling _projects_ that support _priorities_.

So the next time youâre working on a business case, start with a point of
view. Clarify what you think by using a solid framework. Then develop the
project that enables an exec-level priority.
