Youâre looking for a tool that can help your sales team find the content
theyâre searching for, and win more revenue. But the choice can be
overwhelming.

[The sales enablement](https://www.fluint.io/post/your-new-sales-enablement-
job-description) market is a crowded, competitive space. Platforms can vary
significantly in terms of features, price, and ease of use. Plus, youâd like
to be certain youâre investing in the right platform.

**In this post, weâll compare three leading sales enablement tools â
Seismic, Highspot and Showpad â to help you make a confident, low-regret
buying decision.**

Weâll start by summarizing each product, then discuss their features and
what makes each different, so you can compare them side-by-side. Weâll wrap
up with one major gap in each of these platforms that you should consider
before your purchase.

## What makes Seismic different?

Teams use [Seismic](https://seismic.com/) to help their sales reps find the
right content when they need. Seismic acts as a single source for managing,
automating and distributing content, allowing reps to eliminate multiple
systems. It also gives the marketing and enablement team tools to collaborate
on content.

After acquiring Lessonly, Seismic went deeper into a focus on sales rep
training. Their platform allows enablements teams to build out small courses
and training sessions to keep track of how quickly sales reps are learning â
whether theyâre ramping, or diving into new messaging and product releases.

Seismic has also started to differentiate itself through the use of âDeal
Rooms.â Think Dropbox for sales. A branded, segmented page for each account
to access content the seller posts for them.

## What makes Highspot different?

[Highspot](https://www.highspot.com/) is a cloud-based content management and
distribution platform that gives marketing and enablement teams content
automation and analytics. Like Seismic, they designed a platform that combines
content collaboration, management, and a number of enablement functions.

Highspot also has a way to develop training programs to onboard new reps and
reduce ramping time. However, what sets Highspot apart is a deeper focus on
coaching, versus training.

With Highspotâs coaching functionality, managers can measure seller behavior
and provide a more targeted set of suggestions to help them stick to winning
playbooks. Coaching through Highspot also allows you to include methods like
Challenger and Sandler, while showing reps how to improve their execution.

## What makes Showpad different?

[Showpad](https://www.showpad.com/) is a sales enablement platform focused on
bridging the gap between sales and marketing teams, by creating a single,
central location that lets sellers discover, present, and share the latest
content built by their marketing and enablement teams.

In that sense, the basic functionality of their platform is similar to Seismic
and Highspot. Showpad stands out in two different places, however.

First, they place a larger focus on video in the buying experience to allow
sellers to mix up the type of content they share with their buyers.
Additionally, their MeetingIQ tool monitors conversations across the sales
team as a way to enable coaching on talk tracks, and to identify areas that
certain reps need more guidance.

## Where Do These Sales Enablement Platforms Fall Short?

Seismic, Showpad, and Highspot all make it easy for sellers to find and share
company-branded content, created by their marketing and enablement teams.

Thereâs a major gap these platforms donât address in the B2B buying
process, however. Our team interviewed 290+ B2B buyers to figure out exactly
what they â the _buyers â_ are looking for from the sales content shared
with them. Their feedback?

**Buyers want sales content thatâs built with their own words.**

The reason is that major decisions are made during internal meetings â not
sales meetings â when buyers pitch both their problem and a product that can
help to their team.

The buyers we interviewed explained how they:

  1. Sift through stacks of content links and documents hosted by enablement systems, just to find the two sentences in each document that are relevant. Buyers called this the "treasure hunt."
  2. Translate those sentences into their own, internal language instead of marketing jargon, so that they can frame the benefits around their teamâs goals.
  3. Cobble together their own pitch material, based on their own internal formats and meeting agendas.
  4. Circulate with their team for commenting, feedback, and questions, before their next sales meeting.

In short, buyers said they wonât send sales templates and marketing
materials to their boss, because it doesnât sound like them or speak to
their bossâ exact goals.

However, sales reps who don't want to force their prospects on the âtreasure
huntâ have a difficult choice to make. The sales rep can either:

  1. Spend time re-writing template content, so that their buyer is confident enough to share it; or
  2. Save time by using easy, pre-built content hosted in their enablement system.

This is what costs today's sales team winnable deals â enablement thatâs
overly focused on marketing content, not the buyer's internal message.

## Fluintâs Approach

Fluint removes this âeither orâ choice from sales reps by letting them
convert their sales conversations with prospects, into personalized and ready-
to-ship materials buyers canât wait to share.

Think of it like this. Your buyers are helping you to build personalized
enablement content for every single deal, based on what they know will
resonate with their decision makers.

This way, your sales reps can train their deal champions on how to communicate
your productâs value when theyâre not in the room â while enabling them
with materials written in their team's own, internal language.
