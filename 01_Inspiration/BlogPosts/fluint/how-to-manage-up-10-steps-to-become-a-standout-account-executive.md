Early in a sellerâs career, most reps believe sales organizations are
meritocracies.

That good things like promotions and pay bumps, trust and freedom, go to those
who generate the most revenue. Thatâs more true in sales than in most
fields. But itâs still only half true.

**In reality, sales organizations are blends of meritocracy and bureaucracy.**

Sales organizations build âscaffoldingâ to help them scale up. Things like
management hierarchies. Internal reporting systems. Standard procedures. Aka,
all sorts of bureaucracy.

**This creates the need to manage up.**

If you want to keep your career and commission as an individual contributor.
Or youâre interested in making the move to management. Learning to manage up
(bureaucracy) â combined with closing revenue (meritocracy) â is how
youâll control your future, earnings, and work-life quality.

## The Two Keys to Managing Up

The two steps to successfully managing up are:

  1. Create internal allies who hold influence, and will advocate for you.
  2. Enable these allies with a compelling narrative about your performance.

This is done through 1:1 conversations, team meetings, and written materials.

**All with the goal of shaping decisions being made about you, without you.**

The conversations that happen about your career, when youâre not in the
room.

**Sound familiar?**

If youâve read any other posts on this blog, you know I write about two main
ideas:

  1. [Buyers (not sellers) close deals](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-enterprise-sales-playbook#your-new-sales-job-description) when sales reps arenât in the room.
  2. Sales is about creating champions, and [crafting internal communications](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-map-b2b-decision-makers-enterprise-account-maps-that-actually-help-win-deals).

**Which means managing up isnât about acquiring a whole separate set of
skills.**

Itâs about repurposing the same skills high-performing reps use to generate
revenue (meritocracy), to navigate your own organization (bureaucracy).

If you can help your buyers navigate the complexity of their company, to shape
the outcome of a major purchasing decision, itâs time to put these same
strategies to work for yourself.

Hereâs how.  
â

### 1/ Write out your pipeline updates in narrative form.

If you donât create the [narrative](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-ultimate-
guide-to-writing-in-enterprise-sales-how-to-craft-internal-narratives),
someone else will. When this happens, itâs far more challenging to shift an
existing narrative someone that else created.

Start by sending out a weekly pipeline update to your direct manager. Share it
in a consistent format, thatâs easy for them to forward on when needed.

[**Hereâs a framework**](https://www.fluint.io/resources/weekly-pipeline-
update-framework)**you can build from:**

[](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T2Pb6cR5c3UW4UnwFnQRFaVfEmPMZERThsBPfVeYPCk/edit?usp=sharing)

### 2/ Talk in terms of scenarios and dependencies.

Nothing kills your reputation more quickly than deal slippage. Consistently
calling your shotâ¦ only to miss the mark. Time after time.

So instead of saying, âIâll close $Xâ this quarter,â the framework
above uses three scenarios:

  * **Worst Case.** What youâre proactively defending against. Label specific risks here.
  * **Base Case.** This is your most likely scenario, contingent on a few reasonable assumptions.
  * **Best Case.** Your 20 revenue if a few, major deals or wild card assumptions come through.

### 3/ Surface bad news early and often.

I like [Charles Muhlbauerâs](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Manage-
Up-10-Steps-to-Standout-as-an-Account-
Executive-86c60f824d374359a1b36d373b0c6bf8) saying, â _Bad news canât
wait.â_

This is one of the most common, yet costly, mistakes I see young sellers make.
They âshieldâ their manager from bad news. Which robs managers of the
decision to either:

  * **Intervene** and do something about the bad news.
  * **Get ahead** of it by sharing with others.
  * **Save it** for later.

Let your manager make that call. Donât make it for them.

### 4/ Focus your 1:1 time on âhigh-leverageâ requests.

If youâve been doing all of the above, now, your typical 1:1 agenda is freed
up.

Youâve moved past the routine items, and can focus on higher-quality
conversations like:

  * New project ideas youâd like to own and run with.
  * Requests for more/new/different resources.
  * Key account strategies.

By the way, you should use some type of [shared
doc](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-1-non-obvious-sales-tool-you-should-be-
using) to track commitments from these conversations, and your progress
against them.

If a past commitment is important enough, but wasnât completed by your
manager on time, use some of your 1:1 time for it. Just say:  
â

>  _I know_ y _ou have a lot on your plate, and I feel like < commitment > is
> important enough that itâs worth taking 5 minutes to do it together, now.  
>  
> Are you open to spending a few minutes working heads down on this right
> now?_

### 5/ Itâs not what youâre asking. Itâs how youâre asking.

If you have an important and/or urgent ask to make, focus on how you make it.

For example, when I wanted to ask one of my past CEOâs for the resources to
build up an enterprise sales team, that big ask was spread into many smaller
asks over 6-9 months:

  * Can I spend 20% of the teamâs time on landing larger accounts?
  * Can we invest in this product change, to land this first enterprise account?
  * Can we invest in more dedicated, enterprise CSMâs to bring on even more accounts?

And so on. Also, make sure to communicate in the way your manager uniquely
listens.

With some people, Iâd go into in the office for an hourlong meeting and
start with small talk. With others, Iâd keep my questions short and punchy,
shared in a 30 minute phone call.

### 6/ Anticipate your managerâs needs to proactively deliver.

There are two pieces to this one.****

**The first is knowing your managerâs needs.**

We tend to assume our biggest priorities are our managerâs biggest
priorities. However, if you:

  * Learn what questions your managerâs asked, youâll know what questions theyâll ask you.
  * Learn their managerâs big priorities, youâll know what your managerâs big priorities are.

But in all likelihood, your managerâs priorities are constantly shifting.
Which means:

  * Youâll be front-of-mind at times. Say youâre selling the first logos in a new, strategic vertical thatâs key for the whole company. Be proactive, and over-communicate in these seasons.  
â

  * Youâll be out-of-mind at times. Thatâs fine. Itâs okay to go heads down, and allow them some space during these seasons.

**Finally, deliver two steps ahead on their priorities.**

If youâre asked for an update on A, deliver A, but also communicate about "B
and C."

For example, letâs say youâre asked for an update on that new, strategic
vertical.

_"Howâs the pipeline looking?"Â_ Your manager is asking about "A" here.Â

They need to tell Customer Success what accounts to expect and when ("A"). In
this case, donât stop at sharing the revenue or logo forecast. Share what
special exceptions these prospects are requesting ("B"), that are going to
create extra time and staff dependencies ("C").

### 7/ Think like a VP: cross-functionally.

Related to this last point, the more your career advances, the more youâll
find yourself working across department lines. Itâs the natural trajectory
of career growth.

If you're working on leveling up, go ahead and get started. Help someone
outside your team.

**For example, as an Account Executive, you can help:**

  * **Marketing â** create a list of common concerns with phrases that address them, to start weaving this into top-funnel content.
  * **Product â** keep a spreadsheet with how often you hear certain feature requests, and ask prospects to rate them by impact.
  * **Success â** write out a 90-day plan for onboarding a big, soon-to-close account and ask a CSM's input on it, to ensure the customer has a great experience.
  * **Sales â** help your own team by documenting a process that's unique to you, and one you do really well, to share it with others.

It's hard to _not_ be promoted when you're already doing a job that's bigger
than your title.  
â

### 8/ Clarify your personal goals. Carve out a path together.

Nothing is worse than expecting a promotion, pay bump, or other perk â but
not getting one â because you were producing the wrong type of evidence.

Different sales leaders rely on different signals to identify top performers.

Some value predictably. People who hit the number they say theyâll hit â
even if their production is lower than others. Other leaders prioritize team
contributors. Or peer reviews.

Whatever the evidence is, align on it by sharing:  
â

>  _A good year for me will end with < perk / benefit / promotion >, which is
> part of my overall goal to < longer-term career goal >._â _  
>  
>  So, Iâm wondering, what will you and leadership look at, to determine if
> Iâm in a good position for this?_

To state the obvious, if you havenât told your manager what, exactly,
youâre working towards, theyâll have a hard time advocating for you.

### 9/ Gut-check alignment, and ask for direct feedback.

Giving straight-up feedback is hard. Most managers donât like to do it. So
giving them the permission to be direct with you is a gift, for both of you.

Do this by asking questions like:  
â

>  _Related to our discussion on < shared goal >, what do I still need to
> improve on here?_

> _When was the last time you were asked for an update about my work, but
> didnât have the information you needed from me at the ready?_

> _On a scale of 1 â 10, how aligned do you feel my work is with the
> teamâs goals right now?_

### 10/ Be consistent.

The more practices from this list you follow â and the more consistently you
follow them â the stronger the case for you becomes. The thing is:

  * 30% of reps are doing one of these practices
  * 20% of reps are doing two of them
  * 10% of reps are doing three to four
  * 1% of reps do all of them.

How many will you follow this month? Will you follow them again next month?  

**In summary, notice the two common threads tying all of these practices
together:**

  1. Youâre turning your own colleagues into champions who will advocate for you.
  2. Youâre building a strong narrative backed with evidence for them to share.

Which makes managing up just another way to apply your sales skills. Inside
your own company.
