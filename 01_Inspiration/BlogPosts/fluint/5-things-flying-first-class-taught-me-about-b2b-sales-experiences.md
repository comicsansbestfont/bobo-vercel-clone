You communicate through two types of information during every sales
interaction:

  1. Facts
  2. Feelings

Most of us have our facts down cold. You can talk features and benefits all
day. On the flip side, many of us are unaware of the feelings we communicate.

That's because communication isn't what you _say_. It's what your buyers
_hear._ And buyers hear a whole lot more than what you say out loud.

### A First Class Experience

I'm starting this post somewhere over the Atlantic. My wife and I are
vacationing in Portugal, and when I checked us in, I saw a first class
upgrade. For $260 / ticket.

It was a crazy good deal, so here we are. Flying in luxury.

We're no strangers to travel, but neither of us had flown first class before.
We've survived on Southwest Wanna Get Away fares. Which means I'm used to that
frazzled, selfish scramble for carryon space, and trying to balance a drink
and laptop on a 10-inch tray.

I knew first class would be different. The upgrade page told me so. Roomier
seats. Hot food. I expected these things. What I didn't expect is _how I'm_
_feeling._

> _Calm._

> _Grateful._

> _Rested._

> _Like I don't want this flight to end._

All feelings I don't typically associate with travel. That's no accident,
either. It's the result of a thoughtful experience designed to communicate:

_You're important. You deserve this._

Call me a nerd, but I'm fascinated by how our experiences as consumers (think
airlines, Netflix, Amazon, etc.) set our expectations in B2B settings. So this
flight got me thinking:

> 1\. What should you ensure your buyers feel?

> 2\. How do you design a sales experience that communicates through those
> feelings?

### Your Buyer's (Emotional) Journey

Hereâs a visual of your buyer's emotional journey, and below it, Iâll
break down five steps you can follow this week to begin communicating through
feelings, in addition to facts.

### 1) Begin With the Emotion in Mind

This travel experience has given me one overaching feeling: _I deserve this._

Did I need to eat filet for dinner? No, but I deserve more than stale,
uninspired economy calories! Did I need to eat with literal **silverware?
**No, but I deserve the weight and shine of silver!

So what's the feeling you should aim for in your sales process?

**Confidence.** Buyer confidence is the emotion thatâs most closely
correlated with closed-won sales. When buyers feel confident, close rates jump
by 3.6X.

In more specific moments, the most helpful emotion for a buyer will vary. So
while you've heard the advice, "begin with the end in mind," it's even better
to start by asking:

_How do I want my buyer to feel after this meeting / call / email?_

That's because feelings are sticky. People remember how you make them feel far
longer than the facts you share. So don't leave emotions to chance. Plan them.
Just like youâd research your facts.

### 2\. Surprise and Delight in the First Minute

After we boarded, a smiling flight attendant called me by name, and brought me
whiskey, mixed nuts, and a warm towel to relax with. From that moment on, I
knew we were in for a good time.

In sales, you already know you're not **selling to businesses. You're selling
to humans, who get bored, overwhelmed, lonely, and apathetic â just like
you.

That's why you need to make sure buyers **feel surprise and delight from the
first minute of your meeting.** For example, I've...

  1. Hosted a debate on whether or not a burrito is a sandwich.
  2. Streamed Justin Bieber's latest album as people logged into Zoom.
  3. Set a [looping video](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-create-a-looping-video-of-yourself-that-attends-1842843207) of me walking into the room as my background.

...all based on what I could knew about my buyer, to break up the monotony of
their workday.

When you do this, **you create the expectation your meetings are something to
look forward to.**

That's particularly important if you're selling enterprise, which means lots
of meetings. You need buyers looking for a reason to follow up with you. To
bring others with. Not reasons to duck meetings.

(Of course, there's nuance here. If you eat 10 minutes of a 20 minute call
with an executive, there's no delight in that. Generally, think about a 1 - 2
minute experience.)

### 3\. Guard Against the Inevitable Dip

Ten hours is a long flight. There's a point when cabin fever sets in, even in
first class. The attendants knew when we'd hit our low point, and they were
ready with dark chocolate and refreshing facial mist.

There's an inevitable dip in your buyer's journey, too. You can spot it by
looking at your funnel data.

**Assuming your deal stages are well-defined, look for your lowest stage-to-
stage conversation rate.** Maybe it's when a security review starts. Or as
soon as a demo, when your buyer hears pricing.

For one of my past sales team, our dip was so deep that only 13% of deals
closed when the prospect didn't schedule a second meeting after the demo. But
when we did get that second meeting, 47% closed. After we spotted this, we
started asking our prospects:

_Based on what youâve seen, on a scale of 1 - 10, how excited do you feel
about working together?_

This way, we stepped in before the dip. We didnât leave them to troubleshoot
internal doubts alone.

### 4\. Make Champions Look Good in Critical Moments

There was a point toward the end our flight when my wife was beaming, staring
at me. _"You're so good to me,"_ she said. And that is why I'll always look at
that upgrade option. Because when we fly first class, I'm not just Nate.

I become Nate, the proud, loving husband who makes his wife smile.

Your buyers have a personal vision for who they want to become, too. Maybe
they want to be seen as Â intelligent. Someone with prescient insight about
the future of their industry. Maybe they want a juicy bonus to pay down old
debts, but they've got a major problem sitting in the way of their bonus
target.

The next time you're facing a key moment in the buyer's journey, ask yourself:

_Who does my buyer want to become? What can I do to help them get there?_

While this is helpful for any deal contributor, it's critical for your
champions. They're key to your mutual success, and you'll also have more
intimate details on their personal needs. Remember, when your champion looks
good, you do too.

### 5\. Recognize You're Just the Start of the Journey

As we made our final approach into Lisbon, it was 7:30am local time. The cabin
temperature started to warm, drawing us out of our blankets. Soothing music
played, fresh orange juice was squeezed. This brought our flight to a close in
a way that started off the rest of our trip on a high note.

In sales, you're always focused on the close. Hitting your number requires an
insane amount of focus and perseverance. Which makes it easy to believe you're
at the finish line with a signed contract.

But in reality, you've just brought the customer to their starting line. The
best sellers know this, and end their sales process by asking:

> _Does Customer Success know this customer as well as I do?_

> _Have I thoroughly documented any concerns or unique needs my buyer has?_

> _Will the handoff Iâm about to make keep the momentum I built in place?_

Of course, ending the buyer's journey to begin the customer journey is a team
sport. It requires input from both sales and success leadership, AEs and CSMs
alike.

### Feelings, Not Facts, Determine Our Actions

Before you close this post, consider this.

After the stock market dips, billionaires donate far less to nonprofits. Why?
Because they _feel poorer._ They still have more money than they can spend,
but theyâre not as rich as they were before. Their feeling is what
determines their action.

Facts communicate information, but feelings create influence. And since
influence is [in your job description](https://www.fluint.io/post/your-new-
sales-enablement-job-description), you'd be wise to design your buyer's
journey in light of their feelings.
