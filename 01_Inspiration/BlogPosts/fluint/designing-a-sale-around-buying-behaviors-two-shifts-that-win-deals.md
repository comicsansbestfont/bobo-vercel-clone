The steps you take to sell your product are not the same steps prospects take
to buy it.

While thereâs some overlap (meetings on your calendar, activities in a
Mutual Action Plan), your sales activities represent [a
fraction](https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/insights/b2b-buying-journey) of the
**internal sales process** Â your buyers are leading.

That's right, your buyers are selling too.

More specifically, a handful of buyers â [your
champions](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-enterprise-sales-
playbook#part-2-the-deal-champion-job-description)Â â play an outsized role
in closing any complex deal. (The better way to say this is _champions_ close
deals, not sales reps.)

**To the extent you can increase the overlap between your sales activities,
and your champion's internal sales activities, youâll increase your win
rate.**

For this reason, the way we think about our sales process should more closely
align with, and enable, a championâs "internal sale." This postÂ unpacks two
strategies to help you do this:

  1. Increasing your overlap with a champion's internal sales activity.
  2. Designing your pipeline stages around buying behaviors.

Letâs take them one a time.

## Increasing Your Overlap With Internal Sales Activities

Your buyers are working to define their problem and align, on average, 10+
people with conflicting opinions on the right to solve it. Sounds a lot like
sales, huh?

Thatâs why [the job of a seller, simply put, is to enable
buyers](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-enterprise-sales-
playbook#part-1-making-the-mental-shift).

Itâs also whyÂ effectives sellers collaborate with their champions early and
often. To become a better partner to your champion, look at the sale from
their perspective. You'll quickly find that:

  * The 'internal sale' isnât as linear as it seems.
  * Buyers measure the sales cycle differently.

### Buying isnât linear. So complex selling isnât, either.

Compare the basic milestones in a complex buying process with the typical
stages in a sales pipeline, and youâll spot a major difference:

**Most noticeably, the sales pipeline looks _too simple_ for a complex deal.**

We like to think of our sales pipeline as a one-way flow. For example, once
you hit the âproposalâ stage, the deal is qualified and wonât return
back to a discovery stage.

But this doesnât align with the way champions navigate deals internally.
That one-way flow is more like a river. Itâs curving, and often backtracks.

An example of this in the visual above is a buying committee agreeing to an
approach, but learning whatâs (not) possible while evaluating solutions. So
they revisit their requirements, navigate the [inner realities of the
enterprise](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-inner-life-of-the-
enterprise-10-concepts-for-developing-large-deals), and continue on.

### Buyers measure the sales cycle in hours â not months.

Complex deals take time, but itâs not because your champions want that to be
the case.

The less hours they have to spend away from their day jobs evaluating a
solution â and the more time spent doing their jobs with a better solution
in place â the better.

That said, a buying committee will spend more hours evaluating a purchase
(which translates to extra months worth of sales cycle), when:

  * The solution seems too risky.
  * The cost of the problem wasnât clearly measured.
  * The committee continues expanding without a clear owner.
  * Thereâs no consistent communication to keep the process moving.

### Tactics that Enable Your Championâs Internal Sale

With this in mind, hereâs a shortlist of tactics that will help you
influence your champion's internal sales activities:

Trying picking one or two of these to start. Put them to work, then master the
next.

## Designing Pipeline Stages Around Buying Behaviors

There are three sets of activities that happen during any deal:

  1. **Sales Activities.** Prepping for a group demo with a sales engineer.
  2. **Mutual Activities.** The group demo meeting, with both sellers and buyers.
  3. **Buying Activities.** An internal debrief unpacking findings from the demo.

Most sales pipelines are built around the first and second group.****

**Only the rare sales team sets up exit criteria for their deal stages around
the third group.**

Now, if youâre a RevOps team reading this, youâre probably grimacing,
anxiously, but also nodding. Thereâs a benefit but also a massive headache
with adjusting a CRMâs structure.

Breathe inâ¦ Iâm not suggesting a full-tilt change to structure and reports
youâve already built. What _I am_ suggesting is that good sellers enable
good buying behavior.

**So to the extent you can define and attach specific buying behaviors toÂ
your existing deal stages, the more effectively youâll move deals through
your pipeline.**

Hereâs a breakdown of the key behaviors Iâd start with:  
â

#### Stage #1 â Framing a high-cost, high-priority problem in writing.

Every corporate executives is, in the words of Reid Hoffman, âchoosing which
fires to let burn.â So you may have found âpain,â like a legacy system
that end users hate, but thatâs not enough.

Instead, youâve got to [dig deeper and
frame](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-enterprise-sales-
playbook#how-curiosity-and-discovery-develops-
champions:~:text=Charles%20Muhlbauer.-,Framing%20the%20Problem,-How%20you%20and)
that pain as a major threat (thatâs growing worse).  
â

> **Exit Criteria:** a buyer sends a written problem statement, framed in a
> way that aligns with your solution, to the rest of their team.

#### Stage #2 â Multithreaded validation, from different points of view.

Your first contactâs greatest priority isnât always the same as their
companyâs. If thatâs the case, your deal is hanging by a single thread,
which is risky.

So at this stage, youâre looking to become increasingly multithreaded. If
you see multiple different roles and contacts all agree the problem is a
âbig deal,â youâre on the right track.  
â

> **Exit Criteria:** no less than three buyers have read the problem
> statement, and confirmed it directly aligns with a specific, executive
> metric.

Next, the executive whose metric is impacted has to agree that staying the
course is too costly. They need to changeÂ  _something,_ so they dedicate
resources to evaluate that something.

Note, this step can also come after Stage #1. If your first point of contact
is an executive, theyâll refer you to their team, which is Stage #2 above.  
â

> **Exit Criteria:** the executive tasks their team with evaluating and
> recommending a new course of action (bonus points if thereâs a â[trigger
> phrase](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-ask-better-questions-a-roadmap-
> for-more-powerful-discovery#:~:text=Identify%20Trigger%20Phrases%3A)â
> created for the project).

#### Stage #4 â The entire buying committee agrees on an approach.

Cue the opinions. This is where the consensus-based sale kicks in. Itâs also
the stage that most sellers skip past, believing that âdoing somethingâ
means âbuying X software / service.â

The approach the buying committee settles on will either be building, buying,
or partnering. If they choose buying, this is where youâll work to influence
their requirements (and if possible, avoid a competitive search altogether).  
â

> **Exit Criteria:** the buying committee agrees to buying an external
> solution, with a specific set of
> [requirements](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-purchase-decision-
> framework) that align with your solution.

#### Stage #5 â The buying committee confirms youâre their provider of
choice, with a scope.

You never want to negotiateÂ terms until youâreÂ confirmed as the provider
of choice. Meaning, the buying committee isnât evaluating others, because
you can deliver what they can't. (If thatâs not the case, youâll be
bidding â not negotiating â and the prize always goes to the lowest
bidder.)

You also want to ensure all stakeholders (IT and security, for example) signed
off, and youâve locked in a specific scope of work.  
â

> **Exit Criteria:** the buying committee confirms theyâve stopped
> discussions with others, and confirm all have weighed in on a final scope of
> work.

#### Stage #6 â A compelling event begins driving your close date.

The most effective form of [urgency is internal to the a buying
team.](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-one-guaranteed-way-to-trigger-urgency-
in-b2b-sales) Itâs not manufactured by quarter close or discounts. Itâs
driven by a desired outcome with a natural timeline attached.

Of course, this point should be raised and in view throughout the full sales
cycle. But here, youâre going a step further byÂ attaching specific dates to
the steps youâll need to complete â like pricing, procurement, and
commercials.  
â

> **Exit Criteria:** the buying team sets their target onboarding date, based
> on a desired outcome, and agrees to a [backdated set of
> tasks](https://www.fluint.io/resources/mutual-action-plan-template) to get
> them there.

#### Stage #7 â Pricing, procurement and commercial terms finalized.

You should be sharing [your pricing model](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-
confidently-talk-pricing-with-prospects) much earlier in the sales cycle. But
at this stage, youâre looking for buyers to share internal documents
confirming your deal on paper.

When you see confirmation that redlines are accepted, and commercial terms are
locked in, pricing agreement carries far more weight. Any earlier, general
agreement to your pricingÂ is still âsquishy,â and could change.  
â

> **Exit Criteria:** dried ink accepting all terms of your deal.

At this point, most sales pipelines will call the deal âClosed Won.â
However, remember that for your champion and their team, **the customer
journey is just beginning.**

So make sure that any timelines you build with them donât end in a contract.
Walk them out through implementation and onboarding, to their desired outcome.
