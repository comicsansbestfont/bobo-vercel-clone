SVP: âSo how long do we have your team engaged for?â

Me: âHow long?â

(^ I'm slightly confused here)

SVP: âYeah, did we just sign on for this year, or did we setup a longer-term
thing?â

Me: âOh, well neither, thatâs what we're trying to figure out. If and how
we'll structure our work together.â

SVP: âYou mean we havenât actually bought anything from you?â

Me: âSo farâ¦ yes, thatâs right.â

SVP: âThatâs surprising.â

^thatâs an actual transcript excerpt from early 2022, with a $5B cloud
communications company.

The SVP _assumed_ we had some type of consulting / services retainer setup.

The type theyâd typically spend $100K+ on, easily.

But that wasnât the case. We were just [running our sales
process](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-business-case-is-the-sales-process),
and weâd been paid $0 to date.

**The SVP made that assumption because our:**

  * [Discovery went deep](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-hidden-link-between-deeper-discovery-and-crafting-business-cases) with specific datapoints.
  * Messaging was sharp and said âwe get you.â
  * Recommendations were clear and direct.

Plus, everything we presented was built with two internal champions, in their
branding.

**Hereâs why Iâm telling you all this:**

When an executive is surprised theyâre not paying you yet, a contract is
quick to follow. Thereâs no stalling on the decision, no back-and-forth over
scope, and no friction with procurement.

**It all happens,**[**_fast_**](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-cut-deal-
slippage-compress-sales-cycles)** _._**

The back-half of your sales process melts by like butter dropped into a cast-
iron skillet.

Here, Iâm going to break down the framework we used to guide our discovery
early in the deal, and then make our recommendation to [the three
SVPâs](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-avoid-screwing-up-executive-level-
sales-meetings) we were engaged with.

Itâs called the SCR model.

## **The Situation, Complication, Recommendation (SCR) Framework**

Second to [the 1-Page Business
Case](https://www.fluint.io/resources/interactive-guide-the-1-page-business-
case), itâs the next most-used business case framework [inside
Fluint](https://www.fluint.io/see-fluint-tour).

It was originally adapted by McKinsey, to help [simplify a complex decision
for an executive](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-craft-executive-level-
points-of-view-frameworks-for-strategic-reps).

I say âadapted,â vs. âcreated,â because itâs essentially this 3-act
story structure:

Hereâs how each section of the framework comes together:

### Situation

(Whatâs happening?)

  * Start with the facts of whatâs happening, and [company priorities](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-sell-priorities-not-problems-5-steps-to-shift-your-messaging).
  * Focus on framing points [the committee](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-multithread-navigate-dysfunctional-buying-groups-in-enterprise-sales) already knows and accepts.
  * If you donât start with agreement here, your next sections fall apart.

### Complication

(Why do something about it today?)

  * This is why the situation requires action, now.
  * And, why things will get much worse if left unresolved.
  * Without building enough tension here, any [decision to change](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-change-equation-a-framework-to-keep-deals-from-falling-apart) will stall.
  * Make sure to outline root causes too, which sets up your recommendation.

### Recommendation

(What do we do, and how do we start?)

  * The specific [course of action](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-design-a-value-based-sale-and-drive-business-impact#:~:text=Building%20a%20Bridge%3A%20Sell%20an%20%E2%80%9CApproach%E2%80%9D%20Before%20a%20Product) you're recommending.
  * Which will often be more than just âbuy my product.â
  * Itâll include a set of dates, projects, and people invested.
  * Plus a short word on proof points and outcomes after acting.

Put together, itâll flow like this:

### Two Examples of the SCR Framework In Action

The first example is from BCG. Another well-known, top management consulting
firm.

They put this together while advising Sweden on how to adapt its healthcare
system. A pretty major decision, and this text likely represents between $1M -
$5M of strategy work:

Now, back to that transcript excerpt above.

I can distill our entire sales process with that account into [3 concise
bullet points](https://www.fluint.io/post/brief-and-brilliant-how-to-
sell-6-figures-in-3-bullet-points):

  * **Situation:** Marketshare has dropped from X% to Y%, as usage from our core VOIP (voice over IP) product continues to decline while customer communication preferences shift.
  * **Complication:** We prioritized bringing real-time video to market, but our product is already lagging behind new market entrants, and marketing, channels, and sales needs stronger differentiation.
  * **Recommendation:** Acquiring external technologies across both the communications and GTM spaces will be a faster path to market share in the next 5 years, than in-house, organic growth. Enabled by the right partner and platform, with targeted tech scouting.

## How to Use the SCR Framework in a Way that Makes an Executive Surprised
Theyâre Not Paying You Yet

My top 3 pro tips:

**(1) Match your messaging to the execâs level of problem awareness.**

Notice Iâm not explicitly adding the phrase â[problem
statement](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-build-a-compelling-problem-
statement-case-study)â above.

Thatâs because you can include problem statements in âS,â if theyâre
well-aware of a fire.

But naturally, you can add it into the âCâ section as well.

**(2) Flip the order to start with âRâ for any RFP or active buying
process.**

Most deals stall for lack of decision and resistance to change.

But if the buying teamâs past the âSâ and âC,â and theyâre
actively looking at recommendations for who to partner with, jump to âR.â

Lead with the point, then back it up with âSâ and âCâ later to build
buying confidence.

**(3) Start this early, and adapt it over time with input from multiple
contacts.**

Two things happen when you write something down [early in the
deal](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-business-case-is-the-sales-process):

  1. You realize how many [gaps you have in your discovery](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-hidden-link-between-deeper-discovery-and-crafting-business-cases).
  2. You get a much stronger reaction from the buying team to fill those gaps.

Especially from [people who arenât
aligned](https://www.fluint.io/post/selling-in-vectors).

Writing up [a brief-but-brilliant summary](https://www.fluint.io/post/brief-
and-brilliant-how-to-sell-6-figures-in-3-bullet-points) can be harder than it
looks.

So one option you can always consider is having Fluint turn your notes and
call transcripts, into the first draft for you:
