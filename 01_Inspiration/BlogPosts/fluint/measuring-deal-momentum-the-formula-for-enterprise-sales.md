Itâs been said âtime kills all deals.â Itâs true of a transactional
sale.

But in the context of a complex sale, time isnât always the enemy.

In fact, the larger the contract, the longer the sales cycle tends to be. It
takes time to evaluate and execute a strategic deal, with the power to shape
an enterprise teamâs work.

Instead, inertia and irrelevance are the headwinds that cause large deals to
stand still:

  * Inertia: the tendency for enterprises to do nothing, and maintain the status quo.
  * Irrelevance: de-prioritizing one opportunity to pursue another, unrelated project.

To keep your deal moving forward despite these forces, you need to create
**deal momentum.**

## The Formula for Deal Momentum

Momentum is always a product of two factors, mass and velocity.

**Mass** in a B2B setting describes the decision making weight a contact
brings to a deal.

Power consolidates at the top of the corporate structure. Generally speaking,
the higher a contact sits in the hierarchy, the more decision making weight
theyâll carry.

To keep things simple, letâs say the âmassâ of a contact increases by
one point with each level.

**Velocity** references the speed and direction with which your deal is
developing.

In a high-velocity deal, buyers engage in a greater number of conversations
and move further down the funnel in less time.

Again, to keep this simple, letâs assign one point for each pipeline stage
the deal advances.

Now, letâs put these factors together inside the formula for Deal Momentum.

## How to Measure an Enterprise Dealâs Momentum

When best applied, this concept is more of a mental framework than a
mathematic formula. The point is to help you break complex deals down into a
smaller set of factors you can identify and influence.

For example, a VP of Engineering may carry more decision-making weight in your
deals than a VP of Operations. So youâd adjust the formula, and focus on
selling into engineering early in the sales cycle.

Letâs look at the momentum created in three example opportunities:

Compare the first and third deal. While a higher-level contact is engaged in
the third opportunity, the deal hasnât advanced as far down the pipeline,
and itâs taken more time to get there.

If you look at the second deal, itâs pretty clear this opportunity has the
most momentum of the three.

But now, what if youâre comparing two deals in the exact same pipeline
stage?

**Thatâs where this formula become most valuable.**

It allows you to consider all four factors of the formula together, to
identify which deal is picking up steam â and which is at risk of standing
still â even when they look similar inside your CRM.

## Four Drivers of Deal Momentum

Behind each ingredient of this formula are principles that develop larger
deals, and higher close rates.

  * **Expanded Reach.  
â**Involving executives and key employees early drives more deal momentum
than interactions at the bottom of the organizational chart.

  * **Effective Follow-Up.  
â**Activities by a _seller_ arenât factored into momentum â only
activities that buyers participate in. This puts a spotlight on effective
follow-up that buyers reply to.

  * **Showing Commitment.  
â**Interactions become more valuable in the late stages of a deal, as the
buying team grows increasingly committed to seeing the deal through.

  * **Shorter Cycles.  
â**Making more time to engage with a sales rep, over a shorter period of
time, demonstrates that solving a certain problem is a priority that matters.

The question, then, is how do you manage each driver? If you see a deal
slowing down, how do you create more momentum?

## Creating Momentum to Keep Deals Moving

Youâve got the formula, and you understand its drivers. Now, hereâs a
shortlist of activities to focus on, to keep your enterprise-level deals
moving forward:

  1. Invest in deep discovery that creates compelling [problem statements](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-build-a-compelling-problem-statement-case-study).
  2. Make [creating and testing champions](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-enterprise-sales-playbook#how-to-test-and-close-your-champion) a regular practice for every deal.
  3. Send your champions forwardable emails that appeal to executive-level goals.
  4. Develop and test a set of [creative plays](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-sellers-guide-to-creative-deal-follow-up) to kickstart deals that have stalled out.
  5. Find and speak to [internal sources of urgency](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-one-guaranteed-way-to-trigger-urgency-in-b2b-sales#:~:text=What%20Drives%20Your%20Prospects) during the late stages of a deal.
  6. Measure [how much trust](https://www.fluint.io/post/trust-based-selling-how-to-manage-this-hidden-pipeline-metric) youâre creating or erasing with your interactions.
  7. Guide conversations youâre not in the room for with [internal materials](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-enterprise-sales-playbook#elements-of-a-bulletproof-business-case).
  8. [Map out a timeline](https://www.fluint.io/resources/mutual-action-plan-template) from today through the buyerâs desired outcome.

If you focus enough of these activities inside a single deal, youâll create
enough momentum to move even the largest enterprise forward.
