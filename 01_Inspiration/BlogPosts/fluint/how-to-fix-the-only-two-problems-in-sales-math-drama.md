Youâll discover two types of problems in every deal:

  1. Math Problems
  2. Drama

**If youâre not finding and working through both types, your dealâs at
risk.**

Yet most sellers' activity only touches on the first problem â math.
Hereâs the difference:

  * Math problems have solutions. Drama doesnât. 
  * Math is _what_ youâre selling. Drama is about _how_ you sell. 
  * Math is about products that add, subtract, divide. Drama is about people.

Once a math problem is solved, it goes away. Meanwhile, drama persists because
itâs about the stories that we listen to and create for ourselves. Our
brains are wired for drama, which clouds our ability to work through the math
problem.

And hereâs the thing: **math problems go unsolved because of drama.**

Here are two examples.

## Math &Â Drama with Astronauts & Racism

Thereâs this movie, _Hidden Figures_ , thatâs all about the role three
brilliant Black women played during the space race at NASA.

At the start of the movie, the women are treated like pariahs. Sideways looks,
salty conversation, and schemes to prevent them from doing good work. For
example, in an early scene, one of these women, Katherine Johnson, is sent
running across the NASA compound to use a segregated bathroom for "her
kind.â

But later in the movie, astronaut John Glenn says KatherineÂ âÂ who he calls
âthe smart oneâ âÂ needs to _personally_ double-check the teamâs
calculations and the IBM computerâs work before heâll let NASA launch him
into orbit.

So in a twist of fate, a mathematician is sent running across the compound to
find Katherine. And later, Katherine cracks an intense math problem to
calculate the right approach to help Johnâs re-entry, without him dying.

The two types of problems in play here are pretty clear.

**1/ Math.**

Katherine uses a formula called âEulerâs Methodâ to crack a complex
calculation. Itâs literal math written on a massive chalkboard. Addition,
subtraction, division.

**2/ Drama:**

Until Katherine calls out the drama â overt racism, arrogance, mistrust, and
outrightÂ emotional abuse â she canât contribute to the math problem.

Racism wasnât solved in the movie. But the math problem was solved â after
naming and working through racial tension inside the committee.

## Case Study:Â The Two Types of Problems

Making sense? Okay, hereâs the next idea: drama isnât a real problem.

As an early startup founder, I might say, âWe donât have enough money to
do all these things.â Which leads me to believe, âWeâll never grow as
fast as we need,â and, âIâll be seen as a failure.â

But all of thatâs just drama. Itâs not a problem.

Itâs not a problem because thereâs no possible solution. The problem is,
âHow do I meet user need X, with just $Y?â And there are lots of ways to
go about that.

Hereâs a real-life case study of this.  
â

### The Situation

An outdoor retailer was gearing up for the holiday season. They knew theyâd
get a ton of support inquiries from customers asking aboutÂ sizing, gift
return policies, gear specs, etc.

Last year, they tried to get ahead of the holiday rush by investing in
1,000âs of content pages. To hopefully give customers the information they
needed, without overwhelming their support staff with questions. It was a
massive project led by the VP of Support.

Problem was, their customers couldnât find what theyâre looking for inside
all of that content. So theyâd give up quickly, and ask to talk to a human.
Which created a backlog of angry customers, lost revenue from bouncing out of
the order process â and a whole lot more staffing costs.  
â

### The Math Problem

More customer inquiries than support staff, and longer wait times than
patience. The solution?

By **adding** aÂ search API that understood the intent of customer questions,
customers got the right article and the help they needed, fast, without having
to talk to humans. **Subtracting** from the number of support tickets, which
wereÂ easily **divided** among the existing support staff.

### The Drama

It took a _long_ time to get to a solution to a relatively simple math
problem. The reason? Drama. Lots of it:

  * **The VP Support** was scared her reputation was on the line. She pushed for the big content project and didnât want to admit it didnât get the job done.  
â

  * **The Support Manager** was fearful for his job. So he continued telling everyone he was _sooo_ crazy busy and didnât have the time to look at a solution, to appear needed and valued. The backlog = job security.  
â

  * **The eCommerce Director** was nervous he wouldnât hit his order conversion targets, and could easily shift the blame to Supportâs slow response times.   
â

## How to Address Both Problems

Notice in the last case study **that drama was _doing_ something** for each
buyer.

In short, all of the drama boiled down to each buying committee membersâ
need to feel safe in their job, and needed in the organization.

They were telling themselves stories about their internal reputations rootedÂ
in fear and risk.

So when you feel a right-fit deal being blocked âÂ especially one with an
ROI thatâs enough to make any CFO weep tears of joy âÂ thatâs because
members of the buying team believe they _need_ and _want_ the drama to
continue.

**And when thatâs the case, itâs because you havenât connected solving
the math problem to meeting a core longing the dramaâs filling.**

The solution only comes once youâve pushed back the drama for long enough
that you can work the math problem. In this case, itâs helping each buyer
believe a new story:

  * **VP Support:** âMy content project paved the way for this solution to work. Iâll be rewarded and celebrated once we finish the solution.â  
â

  * **Support Manager:** âIâll be free to work on more meaningful projects valued by our leadership â not just running on a support treadmill every week.â  
â

  * **eCommerce Director:** âI know my team has my back, and will come alongside me to make sure I hit my targets.â

We rarely see drama for what it is when weâre in it. Which is why itâs
your job as the seller to label whatâs felt, and connect it back to the math
problem.

(I totally learned this framework from my own therapist by the way. We're all
only human.)
