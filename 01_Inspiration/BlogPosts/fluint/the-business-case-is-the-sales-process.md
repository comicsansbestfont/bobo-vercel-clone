This is one of the most important posts Iâll write on this blog.

Because it represents a massive shift in how sales teams view their jobs, and
how they go to market. Itâs the entire point of view guiding what weâre
building at Fluint, too.

To start, most people believe that:

  * Building a business case is an **activity** _._
  * That activity is one **part** of the sales process:

But thatâs wrong. And this way of thinking and operating leaves an
incredible amount of revenue on the table. Instead, hereâs the right way to
think about it:

  * Building a business case **_is the sales process_.**
  * Every other activity rolls up into the business case.

## Your Sales Process = Building Business Cases

The entire point of a sales process is this:**Â**

**Influencing the buying process.**

That's what creates revenue. Sure, there are other benefits (forecasting,
repeatability, etcâ¦), but they're all secondary goals to generating revenue.

And while thereâs some [overlap between
activities](https://www.fluint.io/post/designing-a-sale-around-buying-
behaviors-two-shifts-that-win-deals) in a selling and buying process, a
sellerâs activity is just [a
fraction](https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/insights/b2b-buying-journey) of the
**_internal_ sales process** the buyer leads.

That's right. Your buyers âÂ more specifically, your champions âÂ are
selling too. In fact, over 90% of that internal selling happens _without_
sales reps in the room.

**Which is where the idea of your business-case-as-the-sales-process comes
in:**

Since your writing can be "in the room" when you canât be, building a
business case _is_ the process of building influence in the buying process.

The whole point of selling.Â

**So business cases aren't just one activity to check off. It's an ongoing
process, that every other activity is guided by, strengthened by, and rolls up
into.**

## Your Single GreatestÂ Sales Velocity Driver

You sales process is measured by how effectively it does 4 things:

  1. Increasing the # qualified opportunities ([without shortchanging](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/natenasralla_close-rate-isthemetric-to-dial-up-during-activity-7150498201362415617-asIO?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) the next 3 drivers).
  2. Closing a higher % those opportunities.
  3. Increasing the $ value of each deal closed.
  4. Closing them faster (effectively extending days to sell in a year).

That's it. The sales velocity formula:

> [Â #Â Opportunities x Win Rate x ACV ] / Sales Cycle

Business cases are the _highest-impact_ , yet _most-overlooked_ approach to
dialing up velocity.

  * Why the highest impact?Â   

Because it's the only approach that moves the needle on 3 / 4 drivers at the
same time.**â  
â**

  * Why the most overlooked?Â   

Because in our survey of 315Â companies, sales teams only had a documented
business case in place for 8% of deals in their pipeline. (If you look at your
pipeline, what % of deals actually have a business case?)

Which makes this a _massive_ , untapped opportunity.

**Here's a snapshot of the outcomes we've measured across Fluint pilots after
making this shift.**

For deals _with_ a customer-validated business case, built with the champion
vs. those _without_ a business case.

Not bad, right?

It's a well-documented gap, too. For example, in [Ebsta's 2024 State of Sales
report](https://www.ebsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/B2B-Sales-
Benchmarks-2024_.pdf), with data from 510 businesses and 4.2 million
opportunities, they found:Â

  * An **8.9X delta in sales velocity** between high-performers, and others.  
â

  * High-performers (those who build business cases)Â represent **17% of reps.**  
â

  * Those 17%Â of sellers **generate 81%** of the organization's revenue.

That's a massive gap. So, the question is, how do you enable your _entire_
sales team to build business cases?Â

Well, you build a process around it.  
â

## An Entire Sales Process, in 1 Page

We could redraw the sales cycle up above, to look something more like this:

Which means that [a single page](https://www.fluint.io/resources/interactive-
guide-the-1-page-business-case) of content â the business case â both
**_guides_** and **_captures_** the sum total of every single selling and
buying activity in a deal. Activities like:

  1. Finding and framing a [high-cost](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-build-a-compelling-problem-statement-case-study), [high-priority](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-sell-priorities-not-problems-5-steps-to-shift-your-messaging) problem.
  2. Creating champions and [building commitment](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-build-test-loop-how-to-create-an-insanely-committed-champion-while-co-creating-business-cases) to the deal.
  3. Securing early, for a new project.
  4. [Multithreaded validation](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-build-test-loop-how-to-create-an-insanely-committed-champion-while-co-creating-business-cases#:~:text=3/%20Expand%20from%20your%20starting%20point%20with%20a%20wider%20circle.), from different points of view.
  5. Aligning the entire buying committee on [your approach](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-design-a-value-based-sale-and-drive-business-impact#:~:text=Building%20a%20Bridge%3A-,Sell%20an%20%E2%80%9CApproach%E2%80%9D,-Before%20a%20Product).
  6. Confirming a scope of work, to [deliver a specific outcome](https://www.fluint.io/post/working-backwards-designing-deals-with-a-concise-1-page-press-release).
  7. Planning out [mutual steps to go-live](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-build-mutual-action-plans-your-buyers-actually-follow-through-on) by a compelling event.
  8. [Sharing context](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-in-enterprise-sales-how-to-craft-internal-narratives) that maintains urgency with IT/procurement/etc.

All of this flow from, and rolls up into, the business case.

For example, [here's Fluint guiding a
seller](https://www.fluint.io/video/fluint-demo-and-product-walkthrough) on
how to shape their deal, with recommendations for deeper discovery alongside
the champion.Â To test for their commitment (will they create together?"), and
develop an executive-level message together.**_  
â  
_**

â

## Building Business Cases is Your Enablement Program, Too

Business cases are like an entire enablement program, compressed into one
document. Ask your reps to write a business case, Â youâll see exactly which
skills are strong â or not so strong.

Skills likeâ¦

  * Deep discovery to find risk and fill gaps.
  * Multithreading with a wider group of contacts.
  * Testing/building champions.
  * The full list above.

**It's the most practical, hands-on way to measure both skills gaps and deal
risks**.

Because a sales leader can pick up a business case document and immediately
see:

  * **(Discovery)** Are we finding a compelling reason to change? How much data vs. fluff is on the page? Did we get beyond workflow and process, to priorities and strategic initiatives?  
â

  * **(Demos)** Do we know which outcomes matter to the team? What their required capabilities are? Which features weâll spend more/less time on accordingly?  
â

  * **(Internal Alignment)** Does our own executive have enough context before joining a call? What should CS / implementation expect to deliver? When are we going live?  
â

  * **(Multithreading)** How many people do we have input from? Does this represent one or multiple points of view? Who contributed what content?Â And do we have âevidenceâ of their engagement?  
â

  * **(Forecasting)** Does finance, procurement and legal, etcâ¦ have the strategic context to push this through on time? While keeping deal value intact as we negotiate commercials?  
â

  * **(Champion Building)** Did key contacts with influence help write this? Do they feel a sense of ownership? Did they change our draft to make sure itâll land?

We could go on. But you get the idea (hopefully).

Now, here's the other nuance:

**Since champions are the real definition of âinside sales reps,â they
need to be enabled.**

The content that goes into co-creating a business case with them is your
_buyer_ enablement program, baked right into your process. Shifting the role
of a seller, into an enabler:

For the sake of clarity:

Stacking up a bunch of marketing-built decks, demo recordings and case studies
onto a landing page (vs. email attachments), is not âbuyer enablement.â

Itâs old-school sales enablement dressed up as buyer enablement. Saying
âwe're giving buyers the information they need to make decisions!â is very
different from the process of creating an account-specific business case
_with_ the customer.  
â

## Why & How to Rollout Your Sales Process 2.0

Itâs a rare sales team whoâs saying theyâre _ahead_ on their pipeline
goals right now.

Building a fat pipeline, to win by sheer volume of opportunities is becoming
increasingly difficultÂ and expensive. Instead, driving up ârevenue-per-
repâ with higherÂ [close rates](https://www.fluint.io/post/why-close-rate-
is-the-metric-of-2023-5-ways-to-increase-yours) and contract value is the
focus.

The Business-Case-as-Sales-Process shift makes this happen. For example:

â Fluint user [Daniel Burke at Sprout
Social](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-burke123/) jumped from 40% (already
much higher than your average) to 70% win rates by building business cases.

â [Gabe Marshall](https://www.fluint.io/video/how-gabe-shrank-his-sales-
cycle-by-50-days) cut 50 days off his sales cycle.

**Yet, building business cases remains the most-overlooked way to drive sales
velocity.**

Why do I say itâs overlooked?

Because in a sample of 190 sales teams weâve worked with over the past 12
months, prior to engaging with us, they only had a business case in place
for**5% - 10% of deals** in their pipeline.

(You can do a quick gut check here. If you look at your pipeline, what % of
deals actually have an account-specific business case built with the
customer?)

That range includes revenue organizations with dedicated value engineers, by
the way.

So the question is:

**If we know deals with a business case close at a higher rate and value than
those without, why arenât we building more business cases?**

One answer is that itâs a skills gap. Sellers havenât been taught how to
build them with the buying team.

**The more likely answer is this fundamentally changes the way revenue leaders
architect their sales-led go-to-market.**

So let's talk practical steps to make this shift:

**Before:**

  * Reps build business cases or bring in Value Engineers to âcloseâ fate-stage deals.
  * Thatâs if they create one at all.

**After:**

  * Reps start drafting the business case after their very first call.
  * The business case develops at each stage of the pipeline. 
  * While exposing discovery gaps and deal risks along the way.  
â

### 1/ Anchor every step and stage in the case.

For example:

  * Doing a demo? Use it to design the game plan.
  * Meeting an exec? Share it as a pre-read.
  * Negotiating? Use it to maintain deal value.
  * Multithreading? Have champions forward it.

Thereâs a use case at each step of the way. As a deal progresses through
each of these activities, the business case should get stronger.

Feel free to adjust the specifics, but it looks something like this:

  * Stage 1 = 2/5
  * Stage 2 = 3/5
  * Stage 3 = 4/5
  * Stage 4 = 4.5/5
  * Stage 5 = 4.9/5

Which also implies there's a way to score your business case against "what
good looks like."

So just like you'd use a scorecard for a call review, you can and should do
the same with business cases.

[**Here's a framework**](https://www.fluint.io/resources/business-case-
scorecard)**you can use by the way, based on the "**[**1-Page Business
Case.**](https://story.screenspace.io/fluint/businesscase)**"**

### 2/ Start drafting business cases on the first call.

This is how youâll show your first contacts you heard them, and have a
[point of view](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-craft-executive-level-
points-of-view-frameworks-for-strategic-reps).

Itâs also how youâll start to drive more executive buy-in far earlier in
the deal (creating more [momentum](https://www.fluint.io/post/measuring-deal-
momentum-the-formula-for-enterprise-sales) and shorter cycles), with [deep
discovery](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-hidden-link-between-deeper-
discovery-and-crafting-business-cases).

â [Hereâs how to do that](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-build-test-loop-
how-to-create-an-insanely-committed-champion-while-co-creating-business-
cases).

â [Fluint](http://www.fluint.io) can also write this draft for you.  
â

### 3/ Start and end conversations with content.

There are a couple benefits to bringing content into your live conversations.

First, we canât help but correct something thatâs inaccurate or incomplete
when we see it in writing. Words feel too permanent to let stand uncorrected.

(Thatâs why [Cunningham's
Law](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law#:~:text=Cunningham's%20Law%20states%20%22the%20best,the%20inventor%20of%20wiki%20software.),
named after the wiki inventor, says the best way to get the right answer
isnât to ask a question â it's to write down the wrong answer.)

**So donât just say a problem statement. Show it in writing.**

Second, youâre creating context to quickly get new buyers up to speed.

While [guiding your champions, when they take on the
work](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-sell-with-champions-ask-them-to-do-
the-heavy-lifting-4-example-questions) of aligning others at the start, or to
confirming next steps at the end, of a conversation.  
â

### 4/ Build accountability checks into the process.

Teams who embrace their Sales Process 2.0:

  * Pressure test the case during deal reviews and forecasting.
  * Create scorecards to measure how strong the case is (not).
  * Create 1:1âs and coaching agendas based on gaps it reveals.
  * Require the content to be built to progress deals in the CRM.  
â

### 5/ Rollout Fluint.

Of course. You can see how it works here:Â

### Final Thought:

As you start to apply this, youâll notice that, little by little, one
document at a time, the buyer is becoming the center of your sales culture.
Their problems and outcomes become the first focus.

And I hear you, peanut gallery. If youâre still raising a skeptical eyebrow
at this idea, let me share a parting thought on how everyone in the revenue
organization benefits from this shift, bulleted by role.

  * **Sellers** (newÂ & existing business):Â a clear roadmap to find and fill deal gaps with champions.  
â

  * **Leadership** :Â grounds forecasts in the reality of where deals actually are.   
â

  * **Enablement** :Â identifies skill gaps and coaching plans for deeper training.  
â

  * **Value Engineers** :Â builds a narrative early to bring meaning to ROI.   
â

  * **SalesOps** :Â defines minimum standards by stage for cleanCRM data.  
â

  * **Customer Success** :Â a specific recap of whatâs promised to the customer.

Since this shift is based on both, (1) written content, and (2) buying
behaviors, everyone can tangibly see whatâsÂ  _actually_ Â been created at
any given time.

So much so, youÂ almost shouldnât need point-in-time QBRâs to assess deal
health. Just open up the written business case, it'll be glaringly obvious.
