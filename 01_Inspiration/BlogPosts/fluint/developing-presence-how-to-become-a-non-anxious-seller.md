Weâve gone deep on all kinds of sales practices, phrases, and process on
this blog.

But thereâs one topic that enables all of them that I have yet to write
about: presence.Â

Chronic anxiety plagues sellers. In fact, [63% of sellers
](https://saleshealthalliance.com/2022-state-of-mental-health-in-sales-
report/)struggle with their mental health. Thatâs 3X the rate for the
general workforce.

This, no doubt, affects how we show up for our championsâthe people putting
their internal reputation behind potentially risky projects with us.

**Which means becoming a calm, non-anxious presence is key to enabling your
buyers.**

Becoming a seller whoâs steady during the ups and downs that selling
enterprise always entails is what makes so many of the frameworks I write
about "work."

But becoming a non-anxious seller is _extremely_ hard while working for
anxious sales leaders.

Which is why I'm directing a good deal of this post towards sales leaders, vs.
reps.

## "Why does he walk around so quickly?"

When I first started leading a strategic team, I was a ball of stress. Always.

I was tipped off that my stress was causing others stress when my wife flew to
Washington, DC to meet me there for a long weekend. The company I was working
for was based there.

She got to the office while I was in a meeting, so I texted our office manager
to see if he could set her up with a desk for a bit.

While she was sitting at a desk near some of the team I managed at the time,
they were talking about me. Completely unaware of who the random lady theyâd
never met before was._â_

 _"Why does he always walk around the office so quickly? Itâs like he
doesnât stop moving and it stresses me out."_

**Later that night, she told me. I was dumbfounded.**

Apparently, I have zero poker face.

Eventually, I realized the root cause of my anxiety was superficial
leadership.

I was too hands-off, and out of control of the teamâs performance. I was
hands-off because I feared micromanaging them. Potentially smothering the life
out of them, causing them to resent me. Instead of believing that I trusted
them.

Soon after this, I started working with an executive coach.

One day, he asked me:

âCan you do your teamâs job better than they can?â

I hesitated, not wanting to come across as arrogant. Slowly, I nodded.

âYes, I know I can.â

âSo why arenât you in the details with them?â __ he asked me back.

## Detailed vs. Superficial Leadership

The outcome from that conversation has since become the top trait on my list
for sales leadership. Sales leaders can either be:

  1. Superficial leaders 
  2. Detailed leaders

John Heider puts it this way in _The Tao of Leadership_ :

> _âThe superficial leader cannot see how things happen, even though the
> evidence is everywhere. This leader is swept up by drama, sensation, and
> excitement. All this confusion is blinding.â_

**The superficial leader is the majority.**

The ones who are hands-off. Then, they rush around stressed out at end-of-
quarter trying to lead with sweeping directives and discounts.

**The detailed leader is the minority.**

**â** The ones who understand complexity. They know ârevenueâ is a
composite of a lot of individualsâ pipeline coverages, contract values,
close rates, and so onâall the way down to account-level situations.

**Superficial leaders** who just ended their quarter are either riding high or
laid low right now.

Theyâll attribute wins to team brilliance, losses to âmarket
conditions,â or other vague causes.Â

**Detailed leaders** are calm, clear on what needs to change next quarter, and
eager to get started.

Because theyâve been by their repsâ sides every step of the way.

You can test someone for detailed leadership by asking:

> _âCould you help me break down last quarterâs performance? Iâm looking
> to understand what youâre finding is driving the teamâs revenue.â_

Then, press in multiple times:

> _âWhat do you think caused that? Does this apply across the team or only
> in certain cases?â_

Plus, youâll _feel_ it. You leave a detailed leaderâs presence feeling
serene and capable.

Youâll leave a superficial leader's presence feeling anxious and frenetic.
Kind of like theyâre always walking around too quickly.

## Becoming a Non-Anxious Seller

If youâre an individual contributor, make note of this for the next time
youâre interviewing. Itâs a nonobvious sign youâve found the right
place, but itâs easy to miss.

When youâre with the person youâll work for:

  1. Does your heart rate speed up or slow down? 
  2. Is your breathing fast and shallow, or calm and deep?

Your subconscious picks up a lot youâre not actively thinking about. Then,
it surfaces those insights to you through physical signals.

Those signals help tell you if a leader is a â[non-anxious
presence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9H-i9lHr28).â Something that
detailed leadership enables.

**And those signals will tell you if the environment youâre about to sell in
gives you:**

  * Poise and a calming presence (attractive to buyers).
  * Freedom to experiment and define your own path.
  * Space for deep, focused work like writing narratives.

**The opposite (anxious leaders) create environments that are:**

  * Frantic and pressure-filled (a turnoff for buyers).
  * Rigid, requiring you to stick to what they control.
  * Reactive and full of interruptions.

Like we said earlier, sales comes with enough anxiety. Which kills creativity
and curiosity.

That makes it incredibly challenging to practice the art of Buyer Enablement,
which focuses on thoughtful selling with skillsets like:

So, top reps who are focused on selling _with_ their buyers always choose to
play the game where they can become, and remain, a non-anxious presence.

Think about it for a second. What type of "presence" are you selling with
right now?

Are you working with superficial, or detailed leaders?

What might happen to your sales numbers if you answered those questions
differently?
