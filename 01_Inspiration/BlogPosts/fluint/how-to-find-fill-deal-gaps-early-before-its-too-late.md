Most people think writing in sales is about documenting what you already know.
But itâs not. Itâs the process of _discovering_ what you _donât_ yet
know.

Shane Parrish from The Knowledge Project puts it this way:

> _Writing is the process by which you realize you do not understand what you
> are talking about. Importantly, writing is also the process by which you
> figure it out._

Thatâs good. âThe process by which you figure it out.â

What youâll quickly find is itâs not actually possible to sit down and
write out a quality, executive-level message at a single point in your sales
process. That first act of writing will simply be your discovery gaps becoming
visible.

Instead, youâll find [writing out your message _is_ the sales
process](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-business-case-is-the-sales-
process#:~:text=Which%20is%20where%20the%20idea,one%20activity%20to%20check%20off).

Itâs the ongoing loop of finding and then filling gaps at each stage.
Because as you write down new inputs from your last meeting, youâre not just
coloring in the blank spaces.

_Youâre changing the outcome of your deal along the way._

## How to Keep Deals From Dying in 31 Different Ways

Remember those old Choose Your Own Adventure books?

If you were born after the early 90âs, theyâre books where youâd read up
until you hit a decision point. Then, youâd choose which way youâd go by
flipping to different pages, based on a set of branching storylines. Each fork
in the road held consequences for how your story played out â eventually
landing you on one of a dozen possible endings.

Hereâs a map of the book _Journey Under the Sea,_ by R.A. Montgomery. It
outlines the narrative with arrows for pages, circles for choices, and squares
for endings:

This book is about finding the lost city of Atlantis, and get this: _it has 42
possible endings_. They fall into a few major categories like these, outlined
by [Atlas Obscura](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/cyoa-choose-your-own-
adventure-maps) as:

> Disappointment: you donât quite get there, your ship is destroyed, your
> eyesight is damaged.  
>  
> Hope: a mysterious submarine saves you, so you get a second chance, but only
> glimpse Atlantis in the sky  
>  
> Danger: you might ride a whale, get eaten by a fish, get eaten by a shark,
> or die by a poisonous snake bite.  
>  
> Atlantis: you find Atlantis, but you might destroy it before you get in. You
> might meet Atlanteans, who appear in different guises in different endings.

Then it goes on to say:

> _This book is particularly tough on readers._ One analysis found that 75
> percent of the endings are unfavorable or deadly. _One of the most poignant
> endings is the one where you choose to pull back from your search, and
> someone else finds Atlantis, and you come to regret giving up your search._

Did you catch the parallel here?

  1. Your discovery questions are forks in the road, and they change how your deals play out. Either leading to hope, disappointment â or someone elseâs win.
  2. Readers only get a happy ending 25% of the time. The other 75% are âunfavorableâ or âdeadly.â (Most sales teamsâ win rates are even lower, around 20%.)
  3. Hereâs the big one, if you go back to the visual:  
Youâll never get the chance to ask certain questions â _and therefore,
discover certain answers, which would have illuminated a whole new set of
questions to ask_ , _and so on_ â without a thoughtful approach to your
first discovery questions.

The point is that what you do in the early stages of your deal will completely
change its trajectory.

**So if you havenât designed your sales process to continually reveal _the
right next question,_ youâll get eaten by a shark. Or a hungry Atlantean. Or
watch your deal die off for any one of 31 possible reasons.**

A natural next question that leads us to, is, â _Well how do we make sure
weâre asking the âright nextâ questions, to stay on the path to a
win?â_

Hereâs how.

## 5 Steps to Find & Fill Deal Gaps

Itâs a pretty straight forward process, really. Youâll:

  1. Start the cycle with a good messaging framework.
  2. Fill in what you can after your first conversation, based on your discovery.
  3. Compare that early draft to what a completed, winning message looks like.
  4. The gap between #2 and #3 reveals what you donât know â while [providing the roadmap for where to go in your next meeting](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-discovery-roadmap).
  5. Repeat.

**Step 1:** Hereâs a simple framework you can use called [The 1-Page
Business Case](https://www.fluint.io/resources/how-to-write-an-irresistible-
exec-ready-business-case):

**Step 2:** Fill in the framework, or [let Fluint write your first draft for
you](https://www.fluint.io/video/fluint-demo-and-product-walkthrough).

**Step 3:** You can also [use this business case
scorecard](https://www.fluint.io/resources/business-case-scorecard) to compare
your draft to âwhat good looks like.â

**Step 4:** Based on the gaps you just saw, use this framework to craft the
right next question to fill them. Which includes a simple grid like this:

Fluint runs this analysis and crafts these questions for you, [like
this](https://www.fluint.io/video/fluint-demo-and-product-walkthrough):

You can also [use the full discovery meeting planner,
here](https://www.fluint.io/resources/discovery-meeting-planner):

As you move on to Step 5 and repeat, youâll find little surprises you just
canât help asking about.

Which means your conversations start to become far more genuine, because
youâre _actually_ curious now. So youâll ask something thatâs more like:

_âSince you mentioned your goal is X, I would have expected you to do Y, but
youâre doing Z. What led you to try that approach?â_

Instead of like a qualifying checklist, _âSo, what criteria are you using to
make this decision?â_

And thatâs the last Choose Your Own Adventure parallel:

This isnât just about how _our_ deals play out as sellers.

Itâs about putting our deals in writing, to guide the _customer journey._

Crafting questions to guide their next decisions â and the internal buying
conversations happening without us in the room â which changes the outcome
of our deals, and their reality, one stage a time.
