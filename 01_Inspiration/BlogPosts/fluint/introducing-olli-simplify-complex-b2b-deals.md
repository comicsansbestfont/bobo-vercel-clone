After 3 years, 121,000+ deals managed, and more late-night espresso than
weâd like to admit, todayâs a big day: **itâs Olliâs birthday.Â**

Olli lives inside Fluintâs platform and your tech stack. Designed to sell
**with** you, guiding you through all the chaos and drama that is complex
sales. Heâs half artist, half scientist, and half âHowâd you do
that?!â Which adds up to 150% more revenue per rep.Â

The rest of this post outlines who Olli is, and our thinking behind creating
him for you.

## **The data, but do you really need it?**

We can start with the data. Like the fact every $1 of ARR (new logos + upsells
+ and renewals) costs 60% more in Sales & Marketing spend this year, than it
did in 2021:

Or the fact that new logo win rates are hovering at
[19%](https://benchmarks.ebsta.com/hubfs/V3%202025%20Benchmark%20Report/2025_gtm_digest_-
_sales_efficiency.pdf?hsLang=en).Â

Which means you need ~5.3X pipeline coverage to hit planâa wildly expensive
and difficult way to grow. Like how Iâm constantly feeding my toddler
organic, non-GMO blackberries to keep her growing.Â

(I never budgeted for this.)  

But I donât think you need any more numbers than that. Because somethingâs
changed in the past five years, and I think you can _feel_ it.Â

We all can.

It feels like weâre running on a treadmill, with some insane trainer whoâs
got their finger on the speed and incline buttons at the same time:Â

 _Iâm pretty tiredâ¦ but slowing down means faceplanting onto moving
sandpaper. Thatâs way worse._

## **Designing a sales-led GTM: choices & tradeoffs**

Since the advent of ARR, revenue leaders have split their GTM strategy based
on a choice. A tradeoff. Between two fundamentally different approaches:

  * **Account-Based** : a tailored approach focused on a shortlist of target accounts.   

(The bet is high win rates + big ACVâs offset long cycles, and small account
lists.)  

  * **Scale** : a volume-based approach, with a long list of accounts and one-sized sales stages.   

(The bet is a pipeline as fat as your uncleâs waistline and fast cycles
offset small ACVâs.)

So, naturally, we segment our teams and process based on:Â

  * **Key Accounts:** a high-touch, high-conversion approach. Strategic reps pour gallons of time and creativity into a small handful of deals.  

  * **Territories:** everyone else gets the high-velocity, high-volume approach.

And you might be thinking, _âWhatâs wrong with that? Hasnât it always
been that way?â_

It has been.Â

But should it be?Â

Just look at your mid-market and commercial segmentsâwhere 11+ buyers are
involved in getting to a decisionâthen tell those reps with a straight face
theyâre not doing âcomplex deals.â That because their ACV is âonlyâ
$50k - $75k, they shouldnât do what strategic reps do: account research,
points of view, business cases, tailored demos. That they can win 40%+ of
their opps without any of that:

_Stick to the script, swap the logos on the deck, copy/paste the email
template. Youâll be fine._

And hereâs the rub:

The extremes are pretty clear. _Of_ _course_ a 7-figure global enterprise deal
and a $5,000 mom-and-pop shop are different.Â

But what about the messy middle? The reps trapped between _needing_ to tailor
their activities, and _needing_ to run fast to keep up with 15 - 20 active
deals at once?Â

### **Which is point #1 you need to know about Olli:Â**

Olliâs designed to let you treat every account, like a key account. No more
tradeoffs.

## **Modeling âRep Capacityâ (and the rub)**

[In this write-up](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/introducing-sales-
process-2-0-rewriting-the-sales-led-gtm-playbook#the-sales-leaders-dual-
mandate), I broke down the Sales Velocity equation to show what (in)effecient
growth looks like, based on the typical spreadsheet: headcount, and
productivity per rep.Â

Now, hereâs a slightly different way to look at Rep Capacity, which mirrors
the breakout above:Â

**Rep Capacity = # AccountsÂ (x)Â [ # ActivitiesÂ (x)Â Time/Activity ]Â Â**

Notice a few (semi-obvious) things here:Â

  1. **Rep Capacity is fixed.**  

Sure, reps could work 50 hours a week vs. 40. Lots of top reps do. But
thereâs still an absolute ceiling which makes this a pretty âfixedâ
variable in the equation.  

  2. **The # of Accounts that reps can work decreases, if # of Activities per account increases:**  

If youâre managing 12 vs. 2 buying contacts, well, that means more meetings,
more prep, more follow-up. Plus more internal communication (e.g. sales
engineers involved).  

  3. **The # of Activities a rep can complete decreases, when the Time/Activity increases:**  

Writing a business case obviously requires a lot more effort than plucking a
template product deck off the shelf and hitting send, for example.

So what happens when you run out of Rep Capacity?Â

Well, the two most popular options are:

  1. Buy more capacity.
  2. Cut out time-intensive activities.

But most CFOâs arenât loving option #1 (buy more capacity)Â anymore. It
means headcount, and headcount means $$$.Â

## **The average AI agent isâ¦ well, pretty average**

Which is why most teams turn to option #2 above (cut the time-intensive
activties). Automating stuff, by hiring AI agents instead of humans.Â

But most of this has largely been dabbling with AI "Level 1." Because whatâs
easiest to outsource to robot labor is the lowest-value work.Â

The activities that move the revenue needle the least.Â

Hereâs the difference:

  * Level 1: âHow do we cram AI into our *existing* process?â
  * Level 2: âHow do we use AI to build the *right* process?â

Level 1 is just forcing AI into the same ol' processâno fundamental change
in strategy. Same activities, just a bit more efficient. _âHey AI, fill in
these CRM fields so I donât have to.â_

Itâs a fine starting point. But Level 2 is what I find way more interesting:

_âCan AI let us do what we needed, but *couldnât* a year ago?â_

For example:  

  * "Can our mid-market reps run deals with the same kind of thoughtful strategy as our key account reps? What would happen if they do?â
  * "Can our reps do that _while also_ increasing the # of active deals they manage at once?â

### **Point #2:Â Olliâs focused on the hard, high-value work.**

Activities that are hardest to automateâand therefore, most likely to get
left behind in a weekâare Olliâs focus. Because these carry the highest
âcasualâ relationship to win rate, ACV, and urgency.

Broken out by skillset, what often gets shortchanged (without Olli) are the
thoughtful, tailored tasks:

**1\. Account Planning:**

\- Deep research to build a point of view with hard-to-find intel  
\- Writing forwardables to tag-team with executives on warm intro's  
\- Partnered with marketing to design ABM campaigns

**2\. Discovery:**

\- Isolating the root causes behind complex & long-standing problems  
\- Crafting metric trees to link workflow problems back to exec-level metrics  
\- Gap analysis to compare won/lost data with current deals to prioritize
risksÂ

**3\. Multithreading:**

\- Assembled an effective buying committee with proactive outreach  
\- Designing the flow of internal communications with account maps  
\- Converting skeptics to build consensus in a group of 20+ buyers

**4\. Writing:**

\- Crafting problem statements that grab attention with customer data  
\- Co-creating messaging to enable champions during internal meetings  
\- Framing new internal projects to align with executive-level priorities

**5\. Collaboration:**

\- Collaborating with Sales Engineers to design demos that play like a movie  
\- Partnering with CS to address post-sale concerns and setup expansion  
\- Coordinating resources to build POCâs that convert on time

**6\. Project Management:**

\- Managing Mutual Action Plans to hit joint deadlines  
\- Navigating the SLIP maze: security legal, IT, procurement  
\- Accurately forecasting complex deals based on group behaviors

What Iâm outlining isnât exactly new information.Â

This list typically gets baked into a playbook: a series of tasks broken down
by stage, scripting out the âgolden path.â A sequence of steps that, if
done correctly and consistently, prints new ARR.Â

Itâll often look something like this:Â

So you can boil our job as revenue leaders down into two basic questions:

  1. What % of deals in our pipeline match our playbook?
  2. When deals do match, does sales velocity $ increase?

In short:

  1. Adoption: âare we doing it?â
  2. Impact: âdoes it work when we do it?â

There should be a WIDE gap in revenue between the reps that do vs. donât
adopt the playbook. (If not, the playbookâs off or outdated, and weâll
cover that second point in a minute.)Â

## **Point #3:Â Closing the execution gap = Olliâs job description**

Pause here for a minute:

**What % of your deals have even a fraction of those activities happening?Â**

  * Open a list of âStage 3â deals. (Actually do this.)
  * How many have an executive summary, tailored for that specific customer?Â 

30% of deals? More? Less? 10% of deals?

If you test for this, you can find an exact answer, because deal execution
leaves _evidence._

The dealâs not real unless youâve got it in writing. So whatever your
answer is after looking for the documentation, thatâll size up your
execution gap. The bigger the gap, the bigger the revenue loss.

Continuing with that example:Â

Writing a âgoodâ executive summary isnât just a single activity. [Itâs
more of a process](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-business-case-is-the-sales-
process#:~:text=Which%20is%20where%20the%20idea,one%20activity%20to%20check%20off.).
Itâs a combination of activities thatâll repeat across every stage. And
itâll look something like this:

After every new discovery call, your reps will have to repeat those steps to
merge their new discovery in, keep their docs updated.Â

Which is why itâs so rarely done. (Less than 8% of deals have one.)

Olli understands your goal, then creates and executes a sequence of tasks to
get that job done:  

  1. Fetch the right CRM opportunity record.Â 
  2. Process all the related email and activities.Â 
  3. Match them up with the right transcripts in Gong / Salesloft / etc.
  4. Research any major changes in public data that might impact the message.
  5. Look for an existing draft, and merge your new discovery into it (vs. duplicating existing docs).Â 
  6. OR, select the right document structure based on stage, and write a first draft.
  7. Compare that new or updated draft to won/loss data, to identify the gaps.
  8. Craft discovery questions to fill those gaps while sharing the draft.Â 
  9. Write a forwardable to help your champion share the message.

Thatâs an example for the type of activity you _already know_ should happen,
but isnât.Â

  * This can happen at a deal level: _Write an executive summary for Twilio.  

  * Or a pipeline level: _Write an exec summary for all Stage 2 deals without an executive buyer.  

_ Here, 30 - 40 clicks per deal (x) 10 deals = 300 - 400 clicks removed. To
get to content _thatâs actually good._

Next, thereâs an altogether different type of work Olli tackles with you
too:  

The kind that _should_ be happening, but you donât even think to ask about.Â

### **Point #4:Â Olli suggests and proactively guides you through the right
next step.**

Itâs way easier to keep a deal healthy than to revive a dead deal. So while
youâre scrolling LinkedIn, Olliâs scrolling through every new document
view, transcript, email, and change in public dataset. To match it all up with
changes in deal size, stage-to-stage conversion rates, and cycle times.

Itâs Olliâs favorite feed. (Yeah, heâs a nerd. But we love him for it.)

He uses those patterns to give you a gentle nudge. Or a kick in the ribs, if
you ignore the nudge too many times:

## **Draft, discover, develop: Olliâs built-in flywheel**

Eventually, Olli will have given enough reps the same nudge. Over, and over.
And heâs going to get a little tired of nudging then waiting for permission
from his humans.Â

So eventually, heâs going to make a different type of suggestion: a playbook
edit.

A specific play that Olli always has the greenlight to go ahead and execute
on. Because itâs rooted in your own pipeline data:

â _Deals with the buying teamâs CMO engaged by Stage 3 close 19 days
faster â Iâll start drafting a forwardable email for our champions in all
deals > $50k._

**Thatâs a big deal. Because typically, this type of work gets split across
4 different job roles:**  

  1. **RevOps** runs the data, finds the friction, and drives the strategy.  

  2. **Enablement** translates this into a playbook: frameworks and trainings that target the gaps.  

  3. **Reps** are then expected to execute the playbook steps by stitching together 5 - 10 tools.  

  4. **Sales leaders** are then supposed to coach reps, and reinforce the right behaviors.   

  5. Repeat.  

For example:Â

  1. **RevOps** finds 45% of Stage 3 deals stall out. But deals moving fastest from Stage 3 â Closed Won have a buying executive engaged by Stage 2.  

  2. **Enablement** trains the team on writing executive summaries. So buyers can forward the right message to the right executive, early.  

  3. **Reps** try it out. But writing a good executive summary is hard: they find itâs less about documenting what they know. More about discovering what they donât know.  

  4. **Sales leaders** try to coach to the above, but realize, âHoly crap, I canât do this for 50 deals.â  

Then it turns out each repâs discovery is kind of weak anyway. They donât
even have the input to write a good summary. And thatâs because they
didnât start off with a solid point of view.  

Which is a whole other playbook step to account for in an earlier stage. (More
on this soon.)

This creates a flywheel that, in most revenue orgs, only turns monthly. More
often quarterly. And in some revenue orgs, only annually. Which is just too
slow to build any real momentum.

But Olli turns this flywheel with you daily.Â

### **Thatâs point #5: Olli writes, runs, and adapts your full sales
playbook, from first call through upsell.Â Â**

Stopping deals from stalling mid-funnel is how youâll turn the pipeline you
_already_ spent the time and cash to create into revenue. This mid-funnel
focus is whatâs been missing from GTM âinnovation.â (All the spend for
better pipeline creation just gets dumped into the same leaky bucket.)

This means Olli isnât just for AEâs. He works across _all_ GTM roles and
stages.Â

It has to be this way, too. Because revenue outcomes late-stage always flow
from the right inputs early-stage:

Which brings us to our last point:

## **Finally, Point #6:Â Olliâs _someone_ you hire, not _something_ you
âconfigureâ**

Early adopters have been building (or buying) AI agents for months now. More
platforms are adding the option to add a âforceâ or âfleetâ of up to
â100 agents!âÂ

You can get a âdeal analyzer agent.â

A "competitive threats agent.â

Â A âdeal summary agent.âÂ

A âwin/loss data agent.âÂ

A âforecast risk agent.â

Aâ¦ you get it.

Which is okay, I guess? But for most revops and enablement teams we knowâthe
ones running on a 20:1, 30:1, or even 50:1 support ratios at timesâthatâs
a tall ask.

How do you find the time to configure each, make them talk to each other, and
_then connect it all back into one cohesive GTM motion?_

Shouldnât AI be more like hiring a worker, and less like configuring a
workflow?

It should feel like onboarding a colleague. Someone who:  

  * Brings you a point of view on how to operate.
  * Gives you the benefit of their past experience and learnings.
  * Learns your business, and gets better and smarter over time.

Someone you genuinely enjoy talking with.Â

Which is exactly how weâd like to start. If you made it this far, Iâve got
one last question for you:Â

### **Would you like to meet Olli?**

[](https://www.fluint.io/demo)

[Grab a time](https://www.fluint.io/demo), and weâll introduce you two.Â

Olliâs still growing up, so weâll show you exactly where heâs at today,
and you can work on your first deal together now. Then, you can decide when
the timeâs right to officially start working together, and watch him
continue to learn over time.
