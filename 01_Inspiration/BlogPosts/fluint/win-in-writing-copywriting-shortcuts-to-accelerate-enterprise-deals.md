The enterprise rep who can write will outsell the one who canât, 10 out of
10 times.

**Becoming a better writer, therefore, is becoming a better seller. With every
memo you draft and narrative you craft, youâre adding a few points to your
win rate.**

However, writing remains [the #1 skills gap](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-
ultimate-guide-to-writing-in-enterprise-sales-how-to-craft-internal-
narratives) for enterprise sellers. Too many sales reps still see themselves
as more âconversationalâ than âcreative.â

Itâs a view rooted in a false dichotomy lingering in the go-to-market world.
The B2B equivalent of that extended relative who wonât leave your house
after dinner's over. It says sellers are talkers, while marketers are writers.
And itâs a dangerous belief.****

**The reality is every enterprise rep either is, or needs to become, a
writer.**

Buyers debate their problems and priorities â and decide who to partner with
â [during internal meetings](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-
enterprise-sales-playbook#part-1-making-the-mental-shift). Not sales meetings.
Which means sales reps wonât be in the room to shape their message when it
truly matters most.

**Your writing can be, though.**

If weâre on the same "page" there, youâre wanting to become a better
writer. (i.e. seller)

Hereâs how: a series of copywriting shortcuts. A kickstart toÂ feel
creative, fast, so youâre more likely to keep on writing. Which, in turn,
will kickoff the write-win-write-win feedback loop.

The more you write, the more you win, so the more you write. And so on until
youâre retired.

## Turning Bad Writing Good

Hereâs your first shortcut: write with contrast.

Showoff the before and after because contrast creates clarity, and your goal
is always clarity.

So letâs use the contrast between good and bad writing to showcase a few
more shortcuts:

The second paragraph is clearly better. But why? What changed exactly?

**Here's a line-by-line breakdown from the visual.**

1/ Replace passive with active voice.

  * The deal was closed â> They closed the deal.

2/ Use your customerâs language.

  * Multitude of delays â> Pushed the close date.

3/ Simplify your word choice.

  * âExcruciatingâ and âprolongedâ â> cut these.

4/ Cut redundant phrases.

  * âUltimately,â and âin the end.â
  * âWon out,â and âclosed the deal.â

5/ Dial up the pain.

  * Before: AI-enabled prospecting algorithm that can search, locate, and deliver...
  * After: Their sales team needed 15 minutes, 5 websites, and 2 cuss words...

6/ Create a visual using analogies.

  * Before: High-quality leads that perfectly fit the ideal customer profile.
  * After: Fits better than your favorite pair of sweatpants.

7/ Shorten your sentences.

  * Before: All in an automated workflow that eliminates manual searching...
  * After: Now, it takes one click. 

8/ Show some personality.

  * Before: It was the best product that won out.
  * After: Game over for the competition.

9/ Show whatâs really at stake.

  * Before: More easily meet and exceed quota.
  * After: Raising that next round of funding? Easy.

10/ Showcase the good life:

  * âNo more long days and late nights stressing about the numbers.â

The âafterâ version isnât perfect. It can still use a little love. But
itâs good enough for an example.

**Now, itâs your turn. Take this paragraph and try re-writing it using the
shortcuts above.**

> The spreadsheet software is introducing a new timeline view that it says
> will provide a clearer and more intuitive perspective on how your work is
> progressing, and provide project management tools within the platform for
> the first time.  
>  
> The new view is a visual layer that displays project information stored in
> Sheets, such as the task start and end date, description, and owner. Users
> can also view more information about the project in the sidebar by clicking
> on a card within the timeline, and also track progress over time by
> accessing updated versions of the timeline at various time intervals (day,
> week, month, quarters, year, and multiyear).

Alright. Feeling warmed up?

Letâs keep rolling with some extra writing tips then.  
â

###  
**1/ Lead with the truth.**

Good writing starts by confirming what your buyer _already_ believes is true.
The headline on Latticeâs website is an excellent example:

Lattice sells to people teams. Naturally, they believe people are the bedrock
of successful businesses.

Iâm also a fan of introducing [non-obvious
insights](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-avoid-screwing-up-executive-level-
sales-meetings#:~:text=Deliver%20a%20Non%2DObvious%20Insight) to challenge
conventional beliefs. Itâs a good approach. And you should use it. But
itâs the sequencing thatâs important here.

Challenging a closed mind is a dead-end. Establishing common ground by leading
with something you both believe creates an open mind, and works withinÂ
[confirmation bias](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-buyers-think-designing-
buying-experiences-with-cognitive-bias-in-mind).  
â

### 2/ Obsess over your headlines.

Hereâs how the copywriting legend David Ogilvy describes the value of a good
headline:

> _On average, fives times as many people read the headline as the body copy.
> When you have written your headline, you have spent 80 cents out of your
> dollar. If you havenât done some selling in your headline, youâve wasted
> 80 percent of your money._

For example, youâre only reading this sentence because you decided to read
past the first sentence. Which (if I may say so) was pretty decent:

> The enterprise rep who can write will outsell the one who canât, 10 out of
> 10 times.

Write and re-write your first sentence until your reader canât help but
continue on.  
â

### 3/ Rephrase and repeat a single truth.

Good writing [travels around the enterprise](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-
to-map-b2b-decision-makers-enterprise-account-maps-that-actually-help-win-
deals). Just the same, bad writing is a plane that canât liftoff because
thereâs too muchÂ weighing it down.

Strip your message down to the single truth your reader needs to understand
and share. Then, say it in a few different ways. Hereâs an example of three
phrases, all repeating Fluintâs one truth:

â

### 4/ Choose your framing wisely.

If youâre shopping for a new car, a Rolls Royce is one of the most expensive
cars you can buy. But next to a yacht, private jet, or rare work of art, it
looks cheap as h*ll.

When asked about it, Rolls-Royceâs Regional Director Peter-Paul Schoppmann
[says they donât have competitors](https://www.motor1.com/news/137944/rolls-
royce-argues-no-competitors/) in the auto industry. Instead, they compete with
art, boats, and real estate.

Thatâs why Rolls Royce frames their cars as unique works of art. Something
you â _commission._ â Not something you â _configure._ â (You donât
configure art.)

Compare the language Rolls Royce uses to frame their cars, vs. BMW or Bentley
(both of which also put themselves in the luxury car category).

**Rolls Royce:**

**vs. Bentley:**

**vs. BMW:**

When you use this writing shortcut, there are two approaches:

  * **Switching the Frame:  
â**See above. This is the Rolls Royce approach.  
â

  * **Negative Framing:  
â**See below. Switching from a benefit to [a loss-oriented
message](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-build-a-compelling-problem-
statement-case-study).

With a negative frame, youâre sharing the exact same facts. But with the
opposite emotional charge. Here are two examples:

  * **B2B:** âSwitching payroll providers will **save you** $30,000 per yearâ â> âIf you donât switch payroll providers, youâll **waste** $30,000 in **unnecessary** spend this year.â  
â

  * **B2C:** "The competition's yogurt is 90% fat-free.â â> âGross. 10% of that yogurtÂ is all fat.â  
â

### 5/ Sprinkle these phrases into your writing.

Good writing has âflow.â It seamlessly transitions the reader from one
line to the next.

If youâre writing something longer than a paragraph, sprinkle these phrases
into your content. Then, adjust the end of the prior sentence, or the start of
the next, to create better flow.

  * At last.
  * Announcing:
  * Finally,
  * You guessed it.
  * Shouldâ¦ notâ¦
  * Thatâs right.
  * Because
  * Ifâ¦ then.
  * Why?
  * âQuoteâ
  * Get theâ¦ without theâ¦

For example, Webflow might tailor the,Â  _âGet theâ¦ without theâ¦â_
and,_âShouldâ¦ notâ¦â_ phrases from their home page for a specific
accountâs reality. Then add it into their sales materials.

Letâs say Webflow's talking to a new products division inside of Nike.

The Nike team needs to quickly launch, test, and learn about new product
lines, independent of their corporate site and approvals timeline. So Webflow
might write:

> _The product site you need â without all the red tape._  
>  
> (Followed by content on goals for new products launched and market share
> captured.)

Then:

> _Your website should be a research tool, not an approvals nightmare._  
>  
> (Followed by content on establishing a process for quickly securing customer
> feedback.)

### 6/ Use vivid verbs.

Look at the last tip. â _Sprinkle_ â sounds more interesting than, â
_Add_ these phrases.â Doesnât it?

The reason is when you spice up your verbs, youâre tapping into emotion.
Youâre nudging your message in the right direction on the Logical <â>
Emotional continuum.

Remember, [people make decisions emotionally](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-
secret-to-better-battlecards-villains-heroes), then justify it with facts,
after the fact.  
â

### 7/ Address common objections upfront.

Every seller knows which [objections](https://www.fluint.io/post/why-buyers-
hide-their-objections-from-you-and-what-to-do-about-it) are inevitable. It's
always just a matter of time before they're raised. The sooner you can address
these in your writing, the more attention you'll earn.

Otherwise, unresolved objections create mental blockers, distracting readers
like a bad stain:

### 8/ Write to a single person.

A classic writing sickness, whose symptoms are jargon and buzzwords, is
writing for âan audience.â Investing legend Warren Buffett has the
medicine: writing to a specific person.

Hereâs [the point he
makes](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/resources/guides/plain-english-
handbook/):

> When writing Berkshire Hathawayâs annual report, I pretend that Iâm
> talking to my sisters. I have no trouble picturing them: Though highly
> intelligent, they are not experts in accounting or finance. They will
> understand plain English, but jargon may puzzle them. My goal is simply to
> give them the information I would wish them to supply me if our positions
> were reversed. To succeed, I donât need to be Shakespeare; I must, though,
> have a sincere desire to inform. No siblings to write to? Borrow mine: Just
> begin with âDear Doris and Bertie.â

The one spin Iâll throw on this is, sometimes, itâs best to write to one
person in your specific audience. Not Warren Buffettâs sisters.

For example, the Economist knows who its readers are:

###  
9/ Use your buyerâs own words.

[Trust and connection](https://www.fluint.io/post/trust-based-selling-how-to-
manage-this-hidden-pipeline-metric) are both key to winning a complex sale.
âCoordinating languageâ is a fancy term for talking like a group youâre
part of, to build trust fast.

When you use the same words and sentence structure as the others youâre
around, itâs a powerful shortcut that signals, âI understand you. Youâre
safe here. Weâre from the same tribe.â

Which turns writing into an exercise thatâs more like âassembling.â
Youâre adding [your buyerâs own words](https://www.fluint.io/how-it-works)
from conversations into a framework. [Like that old game, Mad
Libs](https://www.fluint.io/post/13-standout-mid-funnel-email-frameworks-you-
should-steal-right-
now#:~:text=3/%20The%20%E2%80%9CMad%20Libs%E2%80%9D%20Post%2DDemo%20Email).

â

### 10/ Make it a matter of identity

This one's a subtle miss. Itâs common because at first, you seem to be in
the "good writing" category. You quantified a problem, pointed out the cost of
status quo, butâ¦

â¦the companyâs loss wasnât tied to the way a contact sees themself. The
Heath Brothers write in their book
[_Switch_](https://heathbrothers.com/books/switch/) _:_

> _Because identities are central to the way people make decisions, any change
> effort that violates someoneâs identity is likely doomed to failureâ¦_

**So the question is this: How can you make your change a matter of identity
rather than a matter of consequences?**

The keywords here are _change_ and _identity_. Change, what every closed deal
creates, is successful when itâs _part of us._ Not just our companies.

Understanding and framing a messaging around identity is how you tap
[_internal_ urgency](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-one-guaranteed-way-to-
trigger-urgency-in-b2b-sales). Which already exists inside your buyers, and is
far more compelling than _external_ urgency.

**You see this all the time in consumer brands, by the way.**

For example, [Volvoâs](https://group.volvocars.com/company/safety-
vision#:~:text=Aiming%20for%20zero,injured%20in%20a%20new%20Volvo) messaging
of âno deaths or serious injury in our cars.â That message turns their
auto engineers into guardians. Consumers into caring, concerned parents
looking out for their kids. Another classic example is Lego:

_Built by @justcopytips (worth the follow on Twitter)._

Here, they're taking their messaging three levels deep:

  1. Features. "Here's what it is."
  2. Benefits. "Here's what it does for you."
  3. Identity. "Here's who you'll become."  
â

### 11/ Lastly, you canât multitask. So stop trying.

Multitasking is a myth. Iâm sure youâve discovered this by now.

If Iâm typing out a text, I may be aware that my wife is talking. But Iâm
not actually hearing what sheâs saying. No matter how hard I try to fake it.
And if I try talking to her about our dinner plans, Iâll end up typing
âGreek foodâ into my text.

Itâs the same idea with your writing:

  1. **When youâre drafting, draft.  
â**Just get your thoughts onto the page, no matter how ugly it looks.  
â

  2. **When youâre editing, edit.  
â**Start by restructuring your content. Put the bottom line up front. Make
sure thereâs a logical flow. Then make a second round of edits to clean up
grammar, structure, and so on.

Drafting is about creativity. Editing is about clarity. If you try to get both
of these benefits at once, you end up with neither.
