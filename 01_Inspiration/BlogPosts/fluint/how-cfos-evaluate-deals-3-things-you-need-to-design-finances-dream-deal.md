Most likely, youâre painfully aware that when inflation is up, capital
becomes more expensive â which shrinks budgets like cotton sweaters in the
dyer.

**This also means spending limits fell like rain drops in H2 last year, so:**

  1. Finance is now involved in more buying decisions.
  2. They hold greater influence in the decision process.

**Which leaves you with two options this year:**

  1. Cut the scope of your projects to stay off the approval radar.
  2. Design your deals with finance in mind.

If youâre looking to continue landing large deals, itâs not much of a
choice. You _need_ to structure and de-risk your deals to appeal to the CFO.

Here's how.

## Finance is Strategy, NOT Accounting

Given the reality above (which is kind of old news now), Iâve been reading a
lot of well-meaning posts with advice on selling to CFOâs. Thereâs a big
problem with a lot of them, though.

**They still see Finance as accountants and bean counters out to spend as
little as possible.**

And it's so 2010. Here's the right way to think about the CFO. Finance =
Strategy.

Take it from a CFO of a Series D company who I sold to in the past. She
recently raised a $150M round, and hereâs how she described her job:  
â

>  _Yes, Iâm a CPA, but I donât spend my time as an accountant. My job is
> company_** _strategy_** _.  
>  
>  If our companyâs an airplane, then _**_Iâm the pilot_** _, and my head
> of FP &A is my co-pilot, even though most people think of our CEO as the
> pilot. He says where weâre going, sure, but we plan the route to fly the
> plane there safely.  
>  
> We tell sales and marketing, our engines, how much fuel they can burn. We
> drive R&D spend for new product development to spread our wings, to carry
> more passengers. And we help operations engage the passengers, so they spend
> more during the flight._

Hereâs another example â data from a 2022 HFS Research study with 250,
Global 2000 finance executives, asking about their top three objectives:  
â

**Did you catch that? Enabling _top-line growth_ is priority #1.**

If you read this chart without the headline, youâd assume they surveyed
CROâs. Not CFOâs.

## A CFOâs Mental Model for Evaluating Buying Decisions

The pilot analogy perfectly captures the CFOâs mindset and their #1 goal.
Theyâre driving the company strategy, but theyâre doing it like a pilot
â someone who operates in a highly-structured way because safety (i.e.
removing risk) is key.

In short, a pilotâs job is to:

  1. Get to a target destination on time (or early),
  2. While burning the least amount of fuel,
  3. And guaranteeing passenger safety.

Likewise, the CFOâs job is to:

  1. Hit company revenue targets asap,
  2. While spending the least amount of capital,
  3. And undertaking the smallest amount of risk.

And just to make sure weâre breaking the âaccountingâ stereotype in this
mindset shift, hereâs one more analogy. Think of Finance like a âmini VC
firmâ because they both:

  1. Analyze a companyâs past performance and future potential,
  2. To selectively deploy capital across a portfolio of âbets,â
  3. That generate outsized returns for shareholders.

**Both analogies highlight three elements to the CFOâs job, which are the
same three drivers behind every decision they make:**

Pretty simple, right? Well now, we can combine those elements into a [mental
model](https://www.fluint.io/post/measuring-deal-momentum-the-formula-for-
enterprise-sales) that captures how most CFOâs approach evaluating new
projects.Â **IncludingÂ your deals.**

So Project Value = [Financial Value (x) Risk] + [Strategic Value (x) Risk],
where:

  * Financial Value = Revenue (-) Expenses.
  * Strategic Value = Better positioning to capture Financial Value _in the future._
  * Risk = The probability a project succeeds (or fails). Viewed as a range, or set of scenarios.

In the order from most â> least appealing, this model says your deal creates
value in a CFO's mind when you enable:

  1. **More** (strategic) revenue for **less** cost and risk.
  2. The same (strategic) revenue for **less** cost and risk.
  3. **More** (strategic) revenue for the same cost and risk.

With the groundwork laid, now we can go deeper on this and the modelâs three
drivers.

(Youâll want to read to the end. **Risk** is the most nuanced and detailed
of these sections.)  
â

### 1/ Growth **Priorities Determine Your Strategic Value**

Value is only found in the context of a company priority.

**Your ROI (high Financial Value) might look like a no-brainer, but if itâs
not attached to an executive priority (low Strategic Value), your deal wonât
even show up on the CFOâs radar.**

For example, let's say youâre focused on driving a $10M revenue increase for
an existing product, and think your numbers look pretty good. Meanwhile, the
CFOâs focused on a new product launch thatâs expected to drive $1M this
year... but $100M in the following two years.

This is the second half of the Project Value equation.

Now, let's assume you are in fact aligned with an [executive
priority](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-avoid-screwing-up-executive-level-
sales-meetings), like the new product launch. If your project requires a
significant upfront investment, it can reduce your Strategic Value.

Even if you can show a lower âtotal cost of ownershipâ over the
projectâs lifetime. Because youâre tying up capital, **which limits the
CFOâs ability to invest in other projects.**

Plus, youâve effectively created more "**internal competition"** for your
deal from other strategic projects, which the CFO can't invest in if you're
tying up more capital.

That's important, because your company _always_ prefers cash paid upfront.
Your comp plan may even incentivize you to structure deals accordingly â
which is at odds with the CFOâs mindset.  
â

### 2/ If Youâre Not a Category of One, Youâre Doomed to Compete on Cost

A related point: cutting costs creates **_optionality,_** which is its own
type of Strategic Value. When a CFOâs lowers costs, they're freeing up cash
for other, future investment decisions. So there is _someÂ_ truth to the "bean
counter" persona, but it's because there's a strategic link in play.

**This is why thereâs zero debate about spending _less_ to accomplish the
_same_ objective.**

And it's exactly why youâre doomed to compete on price if youâre seen as a
commodity.

For example, letâs say you have $30 cash. Your partner asks you to pick up
four grocery items on your way home. Theyâre making Italian food for dinner.

It wouldn't be smart to buy a $25 bottle of wine. Youâd be taking a big
risk. If you couldnât afford to buy noodles, garlic and tomatoes with your
last $5, the dinner fails.

So youâd âshop aroundâ for a different wine that will still flavor the
dish, but conserve cash. That would be easy, too. A $25 bottle of wine tastes
the exact same as a $10 bottle in tomato sauce. In this context, wine is a
commodity. One bottle works just as well as the next.

**The way around this? Positioning your company in a**[**different
category**](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-secret-to-better-battlecards-
villains-heroes)**.**

Appeal to your partnerâs love of truffles with a ready-made, organic, white
truffle sauce. Even if itâs a $20+ sauce, thereâs no need for wine,
tomatoes and garlic. This is why, for every $1.00 in revenue growth, category
creators generate [$4.82 of market cap
growth](https://categorypirates.substack.com/p/how-to-dam-the-demand-redesign-
your).

(Practically speaking, this is done inside your
[narrative](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-in-
enterprise-sales-how-to-craft-internal-narratives) â and deal positioning
inside a category of your own is one lesson in the [ Crash
Course](https://sellingwith.io/).)

### 3/ **Risk Appetite Can Kill Deals, Fast**

Speak of Italian foodâ¦ different CFOâs have different appetites for risk.

A global enterprise vs. a Series B startup obviously hold different risk
appetites. And a Series B startup with 36 months vs. 6 months of runway will
also have different risk appetites.

**So hereâs the way to think about the (crippling) power of risk in your
deals.**

Take three examples:

  1. A big bet on a new, âAI-poweredâ something with a significant but risky ROI.
  2. A middle-of-the-road approach. It has more proven success, and a moderate return.
  3. The safe route, sacrificing some of what the other projects promise, for less risk. 

If we put each project into a chart with its Financial Value and probability
of success or failure ("risk"), we can find its Expected Value:

Interesting right? Now let's use a different view. We'll plot each project on
a graph with two axes, Project Value (X) and Success Probability (Y). You can
see how they shake out here:

Now, letâs overlay this matrix on top of this color-coded, 3x3 grid:

**What's interesting is all three projects fall in a similar color (light
green), with a fairly similar Expected Value (~$60).**

Which is where risk appetite comes into play. Generally speaking, if the
Expected Value is the same, CFOâs will _always_ prefer the project with less
risk.

**So if you look like âProject Aâ in these scenarios, the fastest way to
become more appealing is to de-risk the project. Take risk off the table with
your dealÂ structure, for example:**

  1. Starting with a small pilot to prove out one key risk.
  2. Scaling up to the full project based on success,

After, youâll have jumped ahead of Projects B and C. This looks like:

Putting you here in the CFOâs mind:

By the way, risk is another way you can _create_ new deals for yourself.

If youâre lowering the risk profile of an existing investment, thatâs a
value add. Because CFOâs can do one of the following things to mitigate
risk:

  * Avoid It. Remove its cause altogether.
  * Reduce it. Buying / building / partnering to act differently.
  * Transfer It. Take out an insurance or shared-risk policy.
  * Plan For It.Â Create options and contingencies.

If you can provide the first option, then, obviously, youâre in a great
position.

**Even during a spending freeze because youâre immediately raising the
Expected Value of every project** **_theyâve already invested capital
into._**

Last, thereâs one more element to risk we need to cover. Risk is never a
âknown known.â So **figuring out just how much âvarianceâ exists
between the best, worst, and most likely scenariosÂ**(aka the âbase caseâ)
is an exercise finance teams are proâs in.

This can dramatically swing how attractive a deal is, and itâs done using a
âsensitivity analysis.â Which shows the ripple effect of a change to one
assumption on a target outcome.

Project A might be prone to more wild swings, while **Project Bâs upside is
fairly reasonable**. This makes Project B more attractive after the
sensitivity analysis.

(Assuming no adjustments to the deal structure of Project A, to make A even
more competitive.)

By the way, Finance teams will spend **as much time as is reasonable to model
these scenarios.** If thereâs a low risk decision, theyâll put less effort
into diligence. But a Â lot of time may go into modeling more risky choices
â which gets stretched into [months worth of sales cycle
time](https://www.fluint.io/post/designing-a-sale-around-buying-behaviors-two-

This is exactly why the âInvestmentâ section of [The 1-Page Business
Case](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-one-page-business-case) ends with
scenarios. Itâs how CFOâs think. Theyâre used to having control over a
decision, to balance risk and reward, according to their appetite and their
full âportfolioâ of projects.
