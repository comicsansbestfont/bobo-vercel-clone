Sellers have two basic tools â conversations and content. All sellers do is
spoken, or written.

Writing compelling [sales materials](https://www.fluint.io/resource-
content/the-enterprise-sales-playbook#part-5-how-to-enable-your-champions-
internal-sale), to guide your championâs internal meetings, is a powerful
way to sell. But in many ways, effective content relies on quality
conversations.

**The problem is most sellers are terribly inefficient in their sales
conversations.**

A [lack of trust](https://www.fluint.io/post/trust-based-selling-how-to-
manage-this-hidden-pipeline-metric) can be a barrier to quality conversations.
But beyond this, sellers often force buyers to suffer through long, rambling
sentences that arenât as thoughtful as they can be.

**This slows the amount of ground you can cover, requires more time to get on
the same page, and introduces all kinds of tangents.**

For example, you might ask, âSo, how could this work for your team?â
Before sharing a customer story, detailing a few more examples responses to
choose from, and finishing with, âSo yeah, any thoughts?â

Meanwhile, your prospect understood what you were asking in the first few
seconds, has been waiting to talk, and has an entirely different (and more
helpful) direction to head.

So whatâs a sales rep to do about it?

## The Minimum Viable Sentence Framework

The answer is creating Minimum Viable Sentences (MVS). I imagine youâre
familiar with the MVP. A Minimum Viable Product. This is similar. An MVS is:

> Using the fewest words needed to move a conversation forward.

An MVS can be a question, or a statement replying to a question. Itâs built
one step at a time, with complexity introduced as the conversation continues.

**Here are the three parts of an MVS:**

  1. **Goal** : a single, shared objective between you and a buyer.
  2. **Necessary Context** : Reduce asymmetries that can lead to unproductive responses.
  3. **Call to Reply** : a signal for your counterpart to continue in a specific direction.

Letâs use an example.

Letâs say youâre selling customer experience software, and trying to
determine how the rest of your sales cycle will unfold for a particular deal.
You might share the following:

> _If we did a pilot this month, how would you share data on customer LTV?_

This sentence is just 15 words.

In it, youâve included a goal (sharing sensitive data for a pilot), a
timeframe (this month), the context (the focus of a pilot is customer lifetime
value, which is a function of revenue, retention, and margin), and youâve
posed a question. Then, you stop to listen.

The MVS wasnât:

> _As the Success Director, I know youâre always trying to keep customers
> engaged, and I also know youâve been trying to grow revenue from each
> account, so we want to prove out how we can help you get visibility into
> data on that.  
>  â  
> For example, weâre finding investors are really focused on these types of
> metrics, revenue expansion and retention, during diligence. Especially in a
> tight funding market, you need to be really fast in responding with clear,
> accurate numbers. Â  
>  
> So, Iâm thinking that if we did some type of pilot to show off our
> platform to your team, they could see how easy itâd be to quickly get
> access to the types of metrics you have to report during diligence. Like if
> Lifetime Value was dropping from $15K to $10K or something like that,
> youâd want to see that before talking to investors even.  
>  
> But it can be hard to access customer data to start off a pilot sometimes in
> my experience, so weâd want to see if it made sense to do a pilot, or just
> carry on with a team demo with sample data in there. Wondering what you
> think the process for getting access to you customer data might look like?
> Who would have to be involved in that and how would we get the right
> approvals?_

That rambling paragraph was 221 words, and far more common in sales
conversations. Why?

The well-meaning sales rep is trying to:

  1. Demonstrate they listened (mentioning the fundraise)
  2. Share new insights (current capital climate)
  3. Amplify the problem (diligence is tough)

But at the same time, a long list of tangents were opened for the prospect to
wander down. The heart of the question was completely buried.

Now, to the response. If a prospect is replying to the MVS above, they might
sayâ¦

>  _Weâd just talk with Sarah, sheâs our Salesforce admin. She knows how
> to pull account data, and can access billing data thatâs kept in our
> warehouse._

â¦giving the sales rep some insight into how to easy or difficult the pilot
process might be.

However, if the rep led with Option B, the run-on paragraph, the prospect may
have been lost in the clutter, landing on an entirely different train of
thought.

> _Well, weâre not really planning for a fundraise until much later in the
> year, and our CFO is really the one who handles everything that relates to
> reporting data back to the investors. So maybe we could catch up later in
> the year, when itâs looking like weâre getting closer to diligence, and
> our CFO can get involved?_

Of course, this is a semi-extreme example. But you can see the point. By
default, our conversations are weighed down by too many words.

Itâs rare for a rep to pause, think quietly for an uncomfortable number of
seconds, and reply with a single yet intentional sentence.

## 5 Practices for Building an MVS

This may feel foreign, but know that youâll be able to use the MVS without
formulas and frameworks. These concepts will become part of a mental model you
can quickly draw on during your conversations.

### 1\. Set a specific, narrow goal for each conversation.

The MVS requires a great deal of thoughtfulness. When weâre not sure what
weâre trying to leave a conversation with, we compensate with longer
sentences that let us âthink out loud.â We try to work out our point of
view as we go.

Blaise Pascal, famously said, âI would have written a shorter letter, but I
did not have the time,â because distilling a sentence into its essence is
hard.

Before you start a conversation, pause. Whatâs the one point you need to
impress, or [question you need answered?](https://www.fluint.io/resource-
content/the-enterprise-sales-playbook#how-to-test-and-close-your-champion)

### 2\. Build conversations one sentence at a time.

Product teams build software one feature at a time, releasing the minimum
functionality needed to deliver value. This way, they can iterate with
customer feedback. Itâs the best way to know theyâre headed in the right
direction, without waste.

Take the same approach in your sales conversations. Pause, listen, then build
your next sentence based on your buyerâs feedback. Consider our example
above. This is how youâll keep your conversation headed in a productive
direction.

(Note: the MVS is key when talking to executives. If you find yourself being
cut off before youâre done speaking, itâs a sign they lost you, you over-
engineered your question, or you're heading in an unhelpful direction.)

### 3\. Focus on your counterpartâs viewpoint.

The MVS isnât for selfish, impatient people. It requires a great deal of
selflessness.

To use the MVS, youâll need to focus on whatâs most helpful for your
counterpart to hear. Consider their current context, incentives, and
frustrations. Then, form your sentences accordingly. Thatâs the way to
communicate with complete yet succinct sentences.

### 4\. Use data, not stories.

I know. Storytelling is an art form in sales. But often, if weâre [not sure
weâre being clear](https://www.fluint.io/post/minimum-viable-sentences-a-
framework-for-crazy-productive-sales-conversations), weâll provide an
unsolicited anecdote or tell a story to illustrate our point. However,
inherent to a story is more detail than whatâs needed to move a conversation
one step forward.

The alternative is data. Using a specific data point forces you to research
the topic, and a single metric can be worth 100 words.

For example, letâs say you manage a team of Account Executives (AE).
Youâre meeting with a colleague managing the Business Development
Representatives (BDR) supporting your AEâs.

Rather than sharing how stressed your AEâs feel after falling behind on
quota, and the story of a BDR whoâs ramping slowly to explain why, do your
research and say, _âHow can we get BDR-qualified pipeline to $50K per rep,
from the $32K itâs at today?â_

### 5\. Highlight one strong point, not all of them.

Neil Rackham studied expert negotiators to figure out why theyâre so
influential. He noticed most people try to influence by sheer force. Stacking
up a volume of arguments to tip the scales in their favor.

But experts do the opposite. They present fewer points, because as Rackham
says in _The Effective Negotiator_ , âA weak argument generally dilutes a
strong one.â Lead with your most compelling content, leave the rest out.

\---

To be clear, Iâm not suggesting we create Twitter IRL. Plenty of
interactions in sales call for storytelling and off-the-cuff comments. This
strategy is an antidote to the fluff filling the typical sales conversation.

Try out the MVS with a few buyers and youâll quickly see where the concept
is most helpful.

Finally, this isnât just a thing for type A people. This is for everyone â
whether youâre a seller, manager, enabler, or other sales leader. Weâre
all in meetings with other humans, where weâll benefit from bringing more
speed and accuracy to the conversation.

(Yes, I fully appreciate the irony of using 1,500 words to explain the concept
of an MVS.)
