Almost nothing is guaranteed in sales. Thatâs clear to see when a late-stage
deal youâve been developing for months blows up, right before the finish
line.

**There is one constant you can always count on, however.**

Itâs called âcognitive bias,â and itâs the reality that:

  1. All of our brains are all wired in a similar way.
  2. Part of this wiring is faulty, which leads to mental errors in our thinking.
  3. These errors create âcognitive biasesâ which happen to everyone, in every sale.

**The fact that bias will always be part of how we think means its
dependable.**

You can know and predict when bias is leading your buyer astray, so you can
also design a buying experience that leads them back to good decisions.

This post will show you how, by breaking down a set of biases and pairing each
with a practice for selling with them âin mind.â

## Practices for Selling With Bias In Mind

As you dig in, consider which practices youâre already using, and which you
want to adopt.

Are you seeing certain biases creep into your deals more often than others?
Prioritize the practice that relates to that bias, then build from there.  
â

### 1\. **Donât make buying a âconciergeâ process.**

[Make it collaborative](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-1-non-obvious-sales-
tool-you-should-be-using) instead. Involve your champions in hunting down
data, writing a business case, or running team demos alongside you. The
reason?

**Effort Justification** is our tendency to assign more value to something as
we invest more effort into it. Itâs often called the âIKEA effect,â
because people will value the furniture they partially build themselves more
highly than furniture thatâs delivered to them. Regardless of its quality.  
â

### 2\. Focus on anecdotes before introducing facts and data.

Letâs say you sell software for customer support. Starting your message with
an anecdote like:

> _Last night, Gina missed her bus and walked home in a lightning storm,
> because she was stuck in the office until 10pm, trying to catch up on her
> backlog of support tickets._

Then, youâd follow this up by saying:

> _In fact, ticket response times have slowed by 48 hours on average, at the
> same time that ticket volumes have doubled._

The anecdote of Gina walking home, soaking wet, puts these facts into context.
It makes them feel Â more urgent because the **Salience Bias** leads us to
focus on [emotionally-striking
statements](https://www.fluint.io/post/5-things-flying-first-class-taught-me-
about-b2b-sales-experiences) â even when another statement is objectively
more significant.  
â

### 3\. Have champions repeat your problem statement over, and over, and over.

Before sending your champion a bunch of product content, create a clear
[problem statement](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-build-a-compelling-
problem-statement-case-study) together. Then, encourage them to start each
internal meeting by repeating the statement.

**Attentional Bias** assigns more importance to recurring topics. Similarly,
the **Frequency Illusion** means that once you notice something, it starts to
appear with outsized frequency afterward. If you notice one person wearing a
zip-up hoody, suddenly, everyone else is wearing one too.

The same thing happens after your champion clearly states a problem. It
becomes far harder for their team to ignore it, and theyâll begin feeling
itâs a pervasive issue that needs to be fixed, fast.  
â

### 4\. Make sure your buyers set pilot **goals. Not you.**

Itâs common for sellers to take the lead on setting pilot goals. They know
what their product can do, and they want to set goals they can hit. But before
you say, âWeâll boost NPS by 10 points,â ask your buyers to lead the
goal-setting process. Then guide them with questions.

**Expectation Bias** leads us to gather data thats supports our own beliefs.
So even if your pilot boosted NPS by 15 points, your buyerâs likely to
downplay your role in the increase, and look for other explanations, if their
beliefs didnât drive the goal-setting process.  
â

### 5\. Deliver short-term rewards during long **sales cycles.**

Complex purchases require long sales, implementation, and onboarding
timelines. Thatâs at odds with the **Current Moment Bias,** which causes us
to prioritize choices that bring us immediate rewards â even when our
âfuture selvesâ wouldnât make that same choice.

For example, 70% of people will eat chocolate instead of fruit in the current
moment, but the same percentage will choose fruit, not chocolate, while
shopping for next weekâs meals.

The takeaway? [Help your buyers get their job done today](/resource-
content/the-enterprise-sales-playbook#how-to-test-and-close-your-champion). If
all your value is tied to a product, and gated until _after_ the point of
purchase, itâs much easier for a buyer to ghost you.  
â

### 6\. Assign blame to projects and fame to people.

If youâre hoping a CIO ditches their internal build project and buys your
monitoring software instead, donât start by pointing out:Â

>  _âThe project is 5 months late, and $500K over budget.â_

While it may be true, reframe the situation with a statement like:

> _This makes for the most thorough needs assessment I've ever seen._

> _You've already laid the foundation for a successful partnership._

**Escalating Commitments** cause people to rationalize investing _more_ into
their poor decisions, despite the evidence their decision was wrong.

Similarly, the **Ostrich Effect** causes us to ignore bad situations â
especially when weâre personally accountable for them â because admitting
the problem exists is often more painful than living with the consequences.  
â

### **7\. Encourage dissent to help the buying committee find true
consensus.**

Thereâs rarely a single âdecision makerâ in complex sales. Purchases are
made by committees. Committees are made up of a dozen buyers, with different
opinions and conflicting goals. As you [multithread](/resource-content/the-
enterprise-sales-playbook#the-three-ts-of-multithreading-with-champions) with
more of the committee, ask questions that bring dissent into the open.

Youâll fight the **False Consensus Effect** , which leads people to
overestimate just how much others actually agree with them.

Similarly, your champion may be falling for the **Transparency Illusion,**
which causes us to believe others know the full scope of what weâre
thinking. When in fact, a championâs colleagues may not fully understand why
they believe in the deal.  
â

### 8\. Adjust your approach based on your buyerâs level of knowledge.

If your champion hasn't led a complex purchase before, the **DunningâKruger
Effect** may be working against them. It leads inexperienced people to
overestimate their knowledge, so your champion may neglect key steps in their
process, or be overly-optimistic when talking timelines.

Asking âhowâ questions develops their thinking, and lets you build a
[Mutual Action Plan](https://www.fluint.io/resources/mutual-action-plan-
template) together.

Similarly, if youâre working a champion whoâs highly-experienced, the
**Curse of Knowledge** can make it difficult for them to communicate with
less-knowledgable people. Help them simplify their message by [writing out
their internal narrative](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-
writing-in-enterprise-sales-how-to-craft-internal-narratives) together.
