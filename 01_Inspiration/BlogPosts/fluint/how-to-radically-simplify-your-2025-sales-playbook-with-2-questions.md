One CRO we work with made a pretty radical decision this year.

He wasnât the only one, but I think Charlieâs a good example, because when
you hear his teamâs high-level stats:

  * $600M ARR
  * GTM team of 250+ people
  * Focused on enterprises with 10,000+ employees

The first word that likely comes to your mind is _complex._

But the one word that _now_ describes them is _simplicity._ Because after we
re-wrote their sales playbook, itâs built on:

  * 3 core frameworks, 1 - 2 pages long each
  * 1-sentence exit criteria for each stage
  * 1 required scorecard

Thatâs it.

Moving from complexity to simplicity, to give their team focus and that
âahhhh, finallyâ feeling.

Which all started with two questions I gave Charlie and his team. Iâll ask
you the same questions here:

  1. What % of deals in our pipeline match our playbook?
  2. When deals do match our playbook, does sales velocity go up?

## Why these questions matter for you.

First, notice weâre focused on the mid-funnel. [Pipeline progression, not
creation](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/introducing-sales-
process-2-0-rewriting-the-sales-led-gtm-playbook#the-drivers-behind-rep-
productivity-you-can-control). Hereâs why:

  * Pipeline creation is harder, and more expensive. (ROI on pipeline creation dropped ~50% from 1Q23 to 3Q24.)
  * Which means the faster, less expensive path to 2025âs plan is the mid-funnel: fixing ~20% win rates, while driving up ACV.
  * Which ultimately shows up as increasing revenue/rep â every leaderâs 2025 mandate. More revenue, with less people and pipeline.

Another point of context: weâre covering the two basic dimensions to
enabling a sales team.

  1. Adoption: âare we doing it?â
  2. Impact: âdoes it work when we do it?â

So here those questions are again:

  1. What % of deals in our pipeline match our playbook?
  2. When deals do match our playbook, does sales velocity go up?

There are 4 ways to answer this, plotted on a 2x2 grid:

Which zone are you in right now?

  * Objective: high impact and high adoption.
  * Opportunity: more adoption means more revenue.
  * Optimize: refocus playbook on higher impact activity.
  * Obstacle: nobodyâs adopting, because itâs not helping them.

## Question 1, Adoption: What % of deals match our playbook?

To answer this, you need a practical way to test for it.

One that doesnât mean more deal review meetings on the calendar. Which is
why weâve got a saying:

_The dealâs not real if itâs not in writing._

You should be able to pull up a written record of where any dealâs at, and
[get the headlines in < 60 seconds](https://www.fluint.io/resources/cutting-
slipped-stalled-deals-the-modern-sales-leaders-deal-review-framework).

So first, try this:

  * Pick 5 - 10 deals inside your Q4 pipeline.
  * Open up Salesforce/HubSpot and spot-check them.
  * To what extent do they match your playbook? What evidence do you see theyâre being executed âwell?â

Writing forces clarity on [deal & discovery
gaps](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-hidden-link-between-deeper-discovery-and-
crafting-business-cases), and this is often its own operational shift:

â Thinking about a playbook in terms of âartifacts,â or [written
frameworks mapped to each stage](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-
complete-1-sheet-sales-process):

This approach has 2 major advantages.

  1. **For your buyers:** short, written summaries can be âin the room,â even when you canât be. Scripting the message for executive buyers.
  2. **For your team:** itâs how youâll get everyone from your leaders to SEâs to CSMâs on the same page with the customer. Literally.

After your spot-check (which can/should be a regular report):

If you see a low % of deals matching your playbook, itâs probably suffering
from complexity, and lack of focus.

Like the quote my friend Paul Stansik recently shared:

_âThe man who chases two rabbits catches neither.â_

So hereâs the next exercise. Itâs as literal as it is metaphorical. The
idea is to _do less better:_

1/ Throw out every activity in your playbook.

_You should now be looking at a blank page._

2/ Add back just 1 core framework to start.

_Which framework impacts revenue the most? (See question #2 below.)_

3/ After 80% of deals have that framework executed, youâve earned the right
to âaddâ something else.

_Whatâs the next most important framework?_

## Question 2, Impact: Does it make a difference?

There should be a WIDE gap in sales velocity (win rate %, cycle time, contract
value $) between deals that do vs. donât match your playbook in your spot-
check.

If you see:

  * A big velocity jump: spotlight the differences and drive more adoption. This is the âopportunityâ zone.
  * No big change in velocity: thereâs a gap in the playbook. Youâre in the âoptimizeâ zone. See below.

If youâre in this 2nd group, the biggest playbook gap that most sales teams
just donât design for is this reality:

  * 90% of selling (and all buying decisions) happen without reps in the room. So itâs the _internal sale_ that champions lead that matters most.
  * Yet, most sales playbooks only focus on sales reps in sales meetings. Not buyers in internal meetings.
  * That's why building a written business case with champions to guide them is usually âframework #1.â

If [built _with_ the buying team](https://www.fluint.io/resource-
content/introducing-sales-process-2-0-rewriting-the-sales-led-gtm-
playbook#what-exactly-is-a-business-case-not) â starting early-stage and
developing with the deal â this 1 page framework will mean millions in
revenue.
