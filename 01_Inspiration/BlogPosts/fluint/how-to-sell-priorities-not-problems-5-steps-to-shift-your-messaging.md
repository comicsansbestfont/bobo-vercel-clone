We live in an Attention Economy.

Which means budget flows where your buyersâ attention goes.

It also means your competition is the noisy, overwhelming,Â distracting
reality that is "life" right now.

So at times, a competitor will steal your deal. But more often than not,
you'll lose deals because they slip down the priority list.

(The people you need to care, donât. They donât have the time.)

They do have a âheckuva lot to oversee, which is why they keep such a tight
filter on what they do and donât pay attention to.

Reid Hoffman calls this âchoosing which fires to let burn.â He says in
_Blitzscaling_ :

> _Most of us are willing to fight fires; itâs a smaller subset of people
> who are capable of noting the presence of a roaring blaze that might soon
> cut off all escape routes without allowing it to distract them from their
> laser-focused effort to fight a more urgent fire._

## Selling to Priorities, Not Problems

Did you catch that? Putting out a fire isnât enough.

**Solving a genuine problem with real costs isnât enough to grab
attention.**

So I think itâs fair to define things this way:

  * Priorities (plural)Â are mental filters. The brainâs equivalent to email spam filters.
  * A priority (singular) is something specific that executives _are already sold on_ , and actively subordinating other _important_ topics to.

We can plot the relationship between attention (priorities) and win rates like
this, including the Priority Filter:

Notice how win rates only increase _after_ you rise above the noise by selling
to a priority.

A few notes for you on this:

### 1/ Your deal can be 1 of 3 things to your buyer.

You'll either be:

  1. The meeting.
  2. In the meeting.
  3. After the meeting.

In that order. Hereâs how to classify each one:

  * **âThe Meeting.â  
â  
â**Youâre the priority. Youâre addressing a fire thatâs burning so
hot, youâre the full meeting agenda. Youâve captured enough mindshare that
the buying committee spends all their time on the project you'll enable.  

But if you ask to setup [an exec-level
meeting](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-avoid-screwing-up-executive-level-
sales-meetings) and get denied (assuming you meet the [Three Tâs of
Multithreading](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-enterprise-sales-
playbook#the-three-ts-of-multithreading-with-champions)), then youâre not
selling to a leadership priority.  

Dedicated meetings on this topic arenât _already happening internally._ See
below.  
â

  * **âIn the Meeting.â**   

Here, youâve made it past the Priority Filter, and landed as a line item on
an internal meeting agenda. Youâre solving a [costly
problem](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-build-a-compelling-problem-
statement-case-study) for a smaller set of contacts â just not the company
at large.  

(This is where most closed-won deals fall, by the way.)  
â

  * â**After the Meeting.â  
â**When you ask for an update and hear, âOh sorry, we ran out of time last
meeting, Iâm hoping weâll get to it next week,â then your deal is a
thought raised in passing.  

This last one is where the majority of deals fall (most win rates hover
between 17% - 20%, so you could say this bucket represents > 80% of deals).

A friend and VP of Sales, [Kyle Asay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyleasay/),
put it this way:

> Reps would be terrified if they knew how many of their deals died with a 20
> second conversation at the end of a 1:1 between their contact and their
> boss.  
> _  
> âHey so Iâm looking at thisâ¦â  
>  
>  âNot a priority right now, letâs look at it in 6 months.â  
>  
> âOk.â_

This type of after-the-meeting exchange is the difference between _project_ Â
andÂ  _product_ risk.

In a complex sale, the first risk is that no project is prioritized. So your
product isn't even evaluated.

This is basically what happens. Something else steals all the attention like a
younger sibling:

###  
2/ Elevate the focus of your discovery questions to separate issues from true
problems.

Problems are often the first focus in
[discovery](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-ask-better-questions-a-roadmap-
for-more-powerful-discovery). For good reason, too. Writing a sharp problem
statement is the start of a [compelling
narrative](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-in-
enterprise-sales-how-to-craft-internal-narratives).

But if you donât âstack rankâ the problem you discovered against other
problems in the company â including those that are entirely _unrelated_ to
your product â you donât know if youâve found an issue, or a problem:

  * Issues only become problems when theyâre blocking a priority.
  * Leaders see all other issues as _distractions_ , not problems.

So try asking questions like this:

> _Which issues do you think your team would put before this one on your next
> meeting agenda?_

> _Iâm guessing < issue > isnât taking up 100% of your attention. Are
> there are topics you find you and the team spending more time on?_

> _This sounds frustrating, for sure. But Iâm curious why this hasnât
> already been addressed? Is there another project thatâs been more the
> focus lately?_

By the way, when you phrase your questions here, youâll want to _assume_
there are higher priorities. Let your prospect correct you if thatâs not the
case.  
â

### 3/ Craft your message around internal Trigger Phrases.

When you use the shared, internal language of your buyers, it signals that
youâre aligned with their priorities.

That shifts you from selling products, to enabling projectsÂ  _theyâre
already sold on._

Hereâs an example that [Mark
Kosoglow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkosoglow/) shared as part of an inside
look at Outreachâs growth.

âTen Million or Die,â or #TMOD for short, was their internal Trigger
Phrase. Shorthand for the goal everyone was sold on. Hitting $10M in ARR by a
certain date.

Weaving #TMOD into your message would have been your way to:

  * Land the initial meeting
  * Multithread early in the deal
  * Stay top of mind throughout the cycle

Think about writing up a memo for Mark, the VP of Sales, to share with Manny,
his CEO.

The idea is that you to make it unbelievably easy to [forward your
message](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-forward-worthy-follow-up-guide),
without forcing your champion to rewrite it, or translate your lingo into
theirs.

The headline could read something like:

> **#TMOD: A Shortcut on Our Path to $10M**

The question then, is, how do you find a Trigger Phrase?

You can ask:

> _âAre there any certain phrases you keep hearing your leadership team
> repeat over, and over again?â_

Followed up with:

> _Whatâs the link between that priority, and our project?_

As another example, one of our past deals was part of a project named
_Sundrop_. (To create a âbright" future, by "lighting the path" into a new
market.)

I knew we had something big when I heard that.

Because projects without a specific codename or trigger phrase are destined
for irrelevance. They end up in the dark, forgotten corners of the enterprise.

So donât go chasing ghosts.Use the customer's internal language and signal
you're aligned with a project their leadership already put the spotlight ð¦  
â

### 4/ Create a sharp problem statement thatâs framed correctly.

The wait to get a new project approved can be unbearable. (Remember the story
about the womenâs washroom?)

Thatâs even if the request is coming from an employee, with the same email
domain â let alone initiated by an external sales rep.

Thatâs where the process of crafting a written problem statement comes from.
You need a sharp hook to follow the trigger phrase in your headline.
**Hereâs a formula to try out:**

Hereâs an example of how this looks, applied to Driftâs conversational
marketing software:

Along with a second version you can test. This one comes in handy if youâre
in a space thatâs not as easy to measure:

### 5/ Sell the approach before selling a product.

An approach is the path youâll take to reach a certain priority.

Itâs the route highlighted on your map. _How_ youâll reach the goal. Not
_who_ youâll travel with, or _what brand of car_ youâll be driving.

Itâs more neutral than that. Because the approach is always vendor agnostic.
It confirms everyoneâs aligned on the higher order question of:

> _What must be true about how we reach this goal?_

So itâs less, âuse our content automation system,â and more, âshift
the mix of new leads from paid to organic sources.â

Take, for example, a newly-hired CRO. Her company just raised a Series B. The
CRO will ask herself, _Whatâs my biggest revenue opportunity?_ Is it:

  * Acquiring brand new logos?
  * Boosting net revenue retention (NRR)?

Letâs say itâs boosting NRR. Investors have been talking a lot about that
lately. Does she:

  * Hire more account managers for the enterprise segment?
  * Focus on untapped cross-sells in the small business segment?

There are lots of levers she can pull. In fact, if you look this âDriver
Treeâ below, youâll notice that the higher the level contact youâre
selling with, the more routes, choices, trade offs, and âapproachesâ there
are.

You can âdrive revenueâ in a lot of ways.

The CROâs got to pick her priority â which affects buying decisions later.

Now, suppose you sell a sales intelligence platform that helps generate leads.
If the CROâs thesis is that a singular focus on NRR is best, and sheâs
entirely focused on expanding revenue from the customers who already love
them, you have two options:

  1. **Align your platform with her thesis.  

â**Letâs say you can give her data on customers who recently changed jobs,
and could champion her product at their new company.  
â

  2. **Reshape her thesis.  

â**How long can she afford to focus on NRR, without landing more logos to
eventually expand? Arenât the seeds for NRR sown early, in the new sales and
onboarding process?

â**  
In summary, any deal youâre developing thatâs _not_ aligned with a company
priority is at risk.**

Even if youâve built a solid champion, itâs your job to enable them with a
sharp message. To cut through cluttered inboxes, and packed meeting agendas.
