Thereâs one sales practice that everyone uses, but few master.

It has the ability to:

  * Build influence by helping buyers think critically.
  * Drop a prospectâs sales resistance to an all-time low.
  * Create a process thatâs completely focused on buyers.

The practice? Asking good questions.  
â

## They Say Curious Sellers are Key. Thatâs Partially Correct.

From day one, sales reps are taught that genuine curiosity and good questions
are the key to selling. Itâs true. But itâs not the full story.

We need to go deeper in our thinking about discovery.**** Asking better
questions starts by embracing three truths.**  
â**

### 1\. Â Curious reps arenât enough. We need curious _buyers_.

Good sales questions are measured by the level of curiosity they spark in your
buyer. They move you from simply exchanging information, to examining
something your buyers hadnât considered.

You know youâve asked a good question when you hear a response that sounds
likeâ¦

> â¦you know, Iâd like to look into this some more.

> â¦huh, I never thought about that before.

> â¦now thereâs an interesting question.

These responses let you start selling _with_ your buyers, by creating people
who are curious enough to discover the answers alongside you.  
â

### 2\. Â Good questions are about action. Not information.

Questions are powerful tools in a complex deal with a dozen contacts. As
curious buyers go looking for answers, theyâll seek out input from multiple
different people.

Think of it this way â meaningful questions require multithreaded responses.

They create new momentum inside your deal, by expanding your reach into every
corner of the buying committee.  
â

### 3\. Â Qualification isnât discovery. Itâs account research.

Sellers often say they âqualifyâ or âdo discoveryâ as step one in
their sales process. These terms arenât interchangeable, however, because
theyâre not the same thing. The difference is:

  * **Qualification is account research.** It happens at the start of the cycle, to search for a potential fit with a product based on straightforward questions with known answers.
  * **Discovery is continuous throughout the sales cycle.** It searches for meaningful problems, and uses open-ended questions that require reflection and collaboration.

This difference means discovery is a gift that helps buyers:

  * Probe an issue long enough to figure out whatâs really going on.
  * Speak their true problems out loud, and often for the first time.
  * Gain enough conviction in their opinion to push for change.  
â

## A Roadmap for Effective Questions During the Buyerâs Journey

Your buyer is on a journey. Theyâre trying to move from where they are today
(a problem), to where they want to be tomorrow (a payoff). Good questions
clear a path to help them travel.

**This sets up a simple visual, with three types of questions on your
discovery roadmap:**

A simple roadmap to organize your sales questions.

I use this visual because itâs easy to remember, and itâs built around the
buyer.

Frameworks like MEDDICC, SPIN, BANT, etc. raise some helpful points. But
theyâre often used as checklists, which results in qualifying, not
discovering.

So I prefer to link their points to the three categories in the discovery
roadmap. For example, the âMâ in MEDDICC is part of the âPayoff.â What
metrics matter? How will you impact them?

**In the context of enterprise sales, your roadmap should account for the
reality that:**

  * Lots of different contacts need to come along for the ride.
  * Each contactâs job sets up a different starting point and view of the problem.
  * Contacts will hold conflicting opinions on the right direction to head.
  * Varying incentives and personal metrics make for different destinations.

**Your job as a seller is to help your champions clarify their path forward,
and get every contact on the buying committee moving toward the same goal, at
the same time.**

With this visual in mind, letâs dig into two topics with the rest of this
post:

  1. Questions you should include in your discovery roadmap.
  2. Principles for crafting good sales questions.  
â

## Top Sales Questions You Should Be Asking

This wonât be an exhaustive list of questions. (I donât think you need
one.) Instead, Iâll focus on a smaller number of high-value questions
youâll want to work into your sales conversations.  
â

### 1\. Problem-Focused Sales Questions  

#### Seeking to Understand:

> What's something about this issue that others youâve shared it with don't
> always seem to understand?

Buyers love answering this one. It creates the space for someone whoâs
misunderstood, to share why they feel misunderstood.

Thatâs cathartic, and it creates the, "_Finally, someone who gets me,"_
feeling. After talking through their answer, your words will carry more
weight, because you understand in a way others donât.  
â

**Ranking Problems:**

> Iâm guessing < relevant project or problem > isnât your full-time focus.
> Which projects would you prioritize over this one in your teamâs next
> meeting agenda?

Most sellers ask questions that tie back to their product. Thatâs an issue,
because it creates the _illusion_ of buying interest. Itâs like shining a
flashlight in a dark room, while keeping the light beam focused on a small
corner. You can't see what else is there.

Better to move the light around the room. Itâs how youâll spot the ghosts.

The phrasing of this question â which assumes **there are higher priorities
â helps you learn more about your buyerâs job, and allows them to honestly
confirm if another priority is taking up most of their time and attention.  
â

**Creating Conviction:**

> Seems like youâre getting by with < current process > okay. So why not
> hold off, and come back to this project later on?

Urgency canât be manufactured in the sales process. It has to be discovered,
because the most [authentic and effective sources of
urgency](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-one-guaranteed-way-to-trigger-urgency-
in-b2b-sales) are internal to the buyer.

This question assumes the buyerâs current status quo is âgood enoughâ
for them, so they wonât be willing to make a change without a compelling
event, or imminent consequence. Capture their response to this question, and
raise it down the line if [deal
momentum](https://www.fluint.io/post/measuring-deal-momentum-the-formula-for-
enterprise-sales) slows.

### 2\. Process-Focused Sales Questions

**Building a Business Case:**

> Does your team have a standard deck or template for sharing new projects
> with everyone?

This one is my favorite. Strategic AE [Matthew
Rogers](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/natenasralla_matthew-rogers-has-a-
brilliant-question-he-
activity-6942139724287393792-oudv?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web)
swears by it. After asking it, work to:

  * Get a blank copy of their template
  * Match your [business case](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-in-enterprise-sales-how-to-craft-internal-narratives) to their internal format
  * Co-create the content with your champion

The brilliance here? Matt's point is, âYou want someone who wasnât part of
your conversation to digest your message quickly, and be able to articulate it
to others. Putting your narrative into a format thatâs already familiar
makes that easy.â  
â

**Requirements Buyers Are Sold On:**

> What do you believe _must be_ true of a solution for it to work in your
> case?

Emphasize the words âmust beâ when using this question. Itâs a helpful
one because it:

  * Surfaces what your buyerâs already sold on
  * Helps you influence key requirements
  * Lets you challenge their thinking

If you donât ask this, your buyer will silently wait to confirm if you check
the boxes theyâre convinced are must-haves. If you hear shallow or informal
answers, itâs also a great opportunity to add value by helping them [create
a decision framework](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-purchase-decision-
framework).  
â

**Finding the Friction:**

> Seems like everythingâs moving forward smoothly. Is there someone on your
> team who you think might be willing to disagree with us, so we can be sure
> we have a fit?_  
>  
> or_  
>  
>  It doesnât seem like < contact name > fully agrees with this point. Is
> there something you feel we might have missed?

Seek out disagreement, and you'll find the real story of how your deal's
developing.

If your sale feels too smooth, thereâs a chance your champions are handling
all the internal consensus-building alone. Theyâre sanding down points of
friction to keep the deal gliding along.

The reality is someone will have a different opinion. You donât want to
leave champions to find and disarm those opinions alone. Ask questions to
gracefully invite yourself into the process.  
â

**Creating (Not Allocating) Budget:**

> I donât imagine you have extra budget for software just sitting around â
> it typically has to be created. So if we assume for a minute that you feel
> itâs worth the effort, how would you go about creating the budget?

Buyers will create a budget where none exists when thereâs a meaningful-
enough problem, thatâs worth solving. This question uses a hypothetical
scenario to assume thereâs consensus on the problem, so you can dig deeper
into their buying process.

Will other budgets need to be shifted around? Will the owners of those budgets
go for it? Who would make that call, and who would try to block it?

### 3\. Payoff-Focused Sales Questions

**Identify Trigger Phrases:**

> During your last all-hands or executive update, did you hear any certain
> phrases being repeated? Whatâs the link between that priority, and our
> project?

There are always 3 - 5 words that make up âTrigger Phrases.â Executives
repeat these phrases over, and over, and over again. Itâs their internal
shorthand for a priority theyâre already sold on.

For example, Jim Franklin (former CEO of Sendgrid) recently shared his phrase
with me: âMake the Mail Move.â Whether you were working on user
acquisition, deliverability, or a new product feature, it all tied back to
email volume. More accounts, successfully sending more emails.

Understanding Trigger Phrases helps clarify your customerâs desired outcome,
and allows you to position your offering as the bridge to get to it.  
â

**The Thing Behind The Thing:**

> Being able to < main product benefit here > is obviously helpful. But beyond
> the obvious, what does a successful project like this enable you to do, that
> you canât today?

Move past surface-level product benefits to the second- and third-order
consequences of your solution. This is how your message will create interest
at an executive level, and across the whole company. For example:

  * More leads generated â> decreased cost to acquire customers â> higher company value.
  * Faster support responses â> increased NPS scores â> more revenue retained.
  * Better sales materials â> higher close rates â> greater commissions.

**  
Personal Incentives:**

> Everyone tracks their work a bit differently. For example, I use OKRâs.
> Are you personally working toward any certain metrics this year?

Identifying how someone is evaluated, compensated, and promoted helps you
predict how theyâre likely to behave in the buying process. This phrasing
helps you approach the topic â which can easily feel salesy, as if youâre
asking, âHow do I sell you?â â in a more personal way.

Once youâve identified a buyerâs [personal
metrics](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-map-b2b-decision-makers-enterprise-
account-maps-that-actually-help-win-
deals#:~:text=The%20second%20two%20points%20in%20each%20profile%20are%20key.%20Generally%2C%20people%E2%80%99s%20actions%20are%20a%20product%20of%3A),
look at how they tie into their companyâs overall goals, and how youâll
influence each metric.

â

## Principles for Asking Better Sales Questions

###  
1\. Encourage stories, not statements.

Questions that start with the phrase, âTell me about whenâ¦â encourage
buyers to share stories.

Stories elicit emotion, offer context, and lead to deeper understanding than
questions that prompt short statements, and yes/no answers.  
â

### 2\. Ask a higher volume of follow-up questions.

As the number of your follow-up questions increases, so does your conversation
quality. Itâs a signal that youâre listening, and looking to understand.
Your follow-upâs will sound something like:

> So how does this relate toâ¦?

> What does this mean forâ¦?

> Whatâs the connection toâ¦?

### 3\. Share why youâre asking a question.

When someone understands the motives behind your questions, theyâre more
likely to [trust that your intentions](https://www.fluint.io/post/trust-based-
selling-how-to-manage-this-hidden-pipeline-metric) are pure, and theyâll be
honest with you. The truth is ultimately what youâre after, so start your
questions by framing them with phrases like:

> The reason Iâm asking isâ¦

> Typically, I find thatâ¦ so Iâm curiousâ¦

> Since you mentioned this earlierâ¦ it seems likeâ¦

###  
4\. Create a logical bridge between your questions.

If thereâs no logical link between your questions, your buyers will miss out
on the power of the [Socratic
process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method). Itâs the process of
helping buyers form their own conclusions â which always leads to a greater
level of resolve during the rest of the buying process.

You can also link their prior answers to your future questions by saying:

> When you sharedâ¦ was that related to this?

> Aha, so does this connect back to when you saidâ¦.?

> This sounds like when youâ¦

You may even find a connection between different thoughts that your buyers had
missed.

###  
5\. Adjust the angle of your questions.

[Jessie Lewis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewisjessie/) wrote me on LinkedIn,
âI've been trying to ask open-ended questions that are more like 100 degrees
open, not 30 degrees!â Itâs the perfect metaphor.

Asking closed, highly-angled questions narrows your buyerâs options when
responding. This introduces bias, and feels manipulative. On the flip side,
broad questions donât move your conversation forward in a productive
direction. â100-degree questionsâ strike the right balance.

### 6\. Ask the obvious to avoid assumptions.

There are always questions we should ask, but donât, because we assume we
know the answer.

The value of questions isnât limited to the information sellers gain,
however. Thereâs value in helping buyers name a problem, label its costs,
and further explore old issues in new ways.

So, just ask the question. The answer may surprise you.

###  
7\. Â Pepper your questions, donât pour them.

No buyer wants to feel interrogated. They want to have a conversation. Pepper
your meetings with questions as they flow naturally, in between sharing your
point of view and customer stories. Donât pour them out upfront, in a
constant flood.  
â

Finally, remember to keep the discovery roadmap from earlier in your mind.

**Connect the questions youâre crafting on the fly, back to your three
goals:**

  1. Understand where your buyer is today (a problem)
  2. Clarify the outcome that matters most to them (a payoff)
  3. Build a bridge between these two states (buying process)
