Sales reps typically see low or no engagement from buyers while introducing
Mutual Action Plans (MAPs). And honestly, I wouldnât engage with MAPs in the
way theyâre often used, either.

So in this post, weâll break down:

  * What most reps miss about MAPs.
  * How to build and introduce MAPs _strategically._

We'll start with three observations from the buyerâs perspective. To help
put MAPs in the context of everything youâre reading about selling with
champions on this blog.

Hereâs how a Senior DevOps Director âÂ who manages $2M of spend for
developer tools âÂ framed up the topic with me. I'll just label him "buyer"
here.

**This is a long transcript excerpt, but it's worth reading in its entirety:**

> Nate: âSo how do you think about the different materials sales reps have
> created to help you in the buying process?â  
>  
> Buyer: âLike documents and decks and that sort of thing?  
>  
> Nate: âRight. Exactly.  
>  
> Buyer: âSo a new one Iâve been seeing is like a project plan. Where we
> lay out the steps for the purchase. And it's helpful for me to see whatâs
> involved from their perspective, because Iâm going to match up the level
> of effort Iâm seeing they need, to how important I think this project is.  
>  
> It lets me be realistic with the rep about where Iâm at, and just how
> interested I am in going on this journey with them. Then if I am interested,
> that doc isnât going to help me get others interested. I canât just
> bring a bunch of tasks to my CTO and be like, 'Here, look at this.'  
>  
> Heâll be like, 'What the h*ll is this for? Whatâs the point of it?' So
> itâs not really something I use with leadership. Thatâs where Iâm
> writing up what we call a decision memo.  
>  
> Something that says, 'Hey, this is a big deal for us, we need to address
> it.' The content for that is, honestly, up to me. I havenât found many
> reps to be helpful here.â  
>  
> Nate: âWhyâs that? I mean, why do you think reps havenât been helpful
> with that memo?â  
>  
> Buyer: âWell because they donât really know what my executives are
> thinking about. I guess that might be on me to enlighten them, but I find
> most of what I get from them is focused on their product. And honestly,
> itâs pretty common that my CTO wonât even see the thing theyâre
> signing off on."  
>  
> Nate: âGot it, so then what would you ideally want the sales rep to focus
> on with you first? The project plan, or that memo?â  
>  
> Buyer: âWell after leadershipâs already sold on the idea and what
> weâre looking to solve for, then I might give him a real quick glance of a
> project plan to basically say, 'weâre not gonna just wing it here.'  
>  
> So that memo comes first in our internal process. I need people to see the
> need, and get the right people to the table. And thatâs really the trick.
> If I can do that, itâs a matter of time and making sure the details and
> math all works out.â

There are three key points he raises here that most reps miss about MAPs:  
â

## What Sales Reps Miss About MAPs

**1/ First,** MAPs get used in place of [crafting a business
case](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-one-page-business-case).

Which is a huge miss, because they have very different purposes. Here's the
difference:

  * **The âDecision Memoâ answers âwhy?â  
â**  
This is your narrative-style business case framing a costly problem blocking a
[strategic priority](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-sell-priorities-not-
problems-5-steps-to-shift-your-messaging), while recommending an approach to
unlock a specific set of outcome metrics.

  * **The âProject Planâ answers âhow?â  
â**  
This is your backdated series of tasks, owners, and deadlines, showing the
level of effort and tactics to move from a problem to a payoff, once
âsoldâ on the above.  

**2/ Second,** this means the sequence of introducing each document is
important.

Most reps jump right into the tactics of âhow,â before aligning on the
higher-order question of âwhy?â Which is out of order.

Once the buying team is sold on the destination, then, a MAP will help the
buying team decide if they're [up for the
journey](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-ask-better-questions-a-roadmap-for-
more-powerful-discovery):

> Does the level of effort needed align with the level of value my buyers see,
> as compared to other priorities they could be spending time on?

**  
3/ Third,** because each type of doc has a separate purpose, they also have
different audiences:

In short, you need both documents.

You already know [how to craft internal
narratives](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-in-
enterprise-sales-how-to-craft-internal-narratives). So letâs talk about Â
building and introducing MAPs in a way buyers will engage with them.  
â

## 5 Steps to Build and Use Mutual Action Plans Buyers Actually Engage With

### **  
1\. Layout your customersâ typical buying process.**

[Make a list of every step](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-
map-b2b-decision-makers-enterprise-account-maps-that-actually-help-win-
deals#:~:text=Step%201%3A%20Inventory%20the%20typical%20communications%20involved%20in%20your%20past%20deals.)
from agreeing thereâs a problem, through onboarding and adoption, unique to
your product.

Selling cybersecurity software? Thereâs likely some more intensive IT and
Security steps than another buying process. Some more specific steps to
consider are:

  * **Security:** How long does the typical review take? Whoâs involved?
  * **Legal:** Will you start with your contract, or theirs? What are standard terms? How long will redlines take?
  * **Procurement:** Would something trigger a competitive RFP? How do vendor requirements compare to you? How are these reviewed, and with who? How long does it take?
  * **Finance:** How will budget be created? Will finance get involved? If so, when, and how do they review new requests?

**A big mistake to avoid here is stopping at closed-won.** **Thatâs Â a
âClose Plan,â not a MAP.**

Remember, for your champion and their team, the customer journey _begins_
after the contract. Youâre getting them to the starting line. Not the
finish.  
â

### **2\. Organize your list into a simple grid.**

Major projects that our product team works on are organized into âepics.â
Epics are larger milestones that need input from multiple people, broken down
into a smaller set of tasks.

For example, âCreate Budgetâ may be one epic with the tasks:

  1. Share data on the number of monthly support tickets.  
â

  2. Project two-year cost savings and pick a software tier.  
â

  3. Present savings and budget plan to the CFO.  
â

  4. Sign off on payment amount and structure.  
â

**Next, since this is a**[** _mutual_
plan**](https://www.fluint.io/post/designing-a-sale-around-buying-behaviors-
two-shifts-that-win-deals)**, split out the tasks between your own team â
you, your executives, sales engineers, customer success, etc. â as well as
the buying team.**

Each task should have a DRI â âDirectly Responsible Individualâ â and
a deadline.

Think about a simple spreadsheet, with the list of tasks running vertically in
rows, with owners, deadlines, and notes running horizontally in columns.

[**> >Â Download a template here.**](https://www.fluint.io/resources/mutual-
action-plan-template)

**The reason I say âsimpleâ is the idea introduced in the excerpt above:
return on effort.**

If your list seems too long and complex, even if the tasks are relatively
easy, then the _perceived_ level of effort will be too high. Which drops the
ROE: âreturn on effort.â

However, you donât want to skip steps to make the process seem easier than
it actually is. Thatâs how you end up sinking too much time into a dead-end
deal.  
â

### **3\. Adapt your baseline with your championâs feedback.**

Now, youâve got a baseline MAP. Something you can introduce in a
conversation with your champion. Share it during a call and ask what you
should adapt:

> _Hereâs the process we typically see customers using to go live and make
> sure everyoneâs on the same page.  
>  
>  How does this compare to any past purchases youâve made?  
>  
> Itâd be great to cut what you donât think applies, and add anything
> Iâve missed._

If your champion spearheaded a past purchase, theyâll have more detailed
feedback here.

**If they havenât, ask them what in the MAP is surprising to them.**

Which can help reveal where youâll either need to educate them on why that
step is important, or, edit the plan after discussing.  
â

### **4\. Work backwards from a compelling event.**

We said each step needs a deadline. These deadlines, and the length of time
needed for a task, lets you know how far ahead of a âcompelling eventâ you
need to start a task.

Compelling events are rooted in a time-bound need or goal that _already exist_
inside the account. Itâs a date Â you discover with your buyers. [Not
something you can manufacture](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-one-guaranteed-
way-to-trigger-urgency-in-b2b-sales) as a seller.

For example:

  * New product launches communicated in a press release.
  * Holiday shopping seasons bringing a rush of site traffic.
  * Use-it-or-lose-it budget scenarios. (The sellerâs dream.)

If you have 90 days worth of tasks, and a holiday Â season 90 days away, well
then, giddy up.  
â

### **5\. Use maps strategically, not administratively.**

Too many reps see MAPs as a source of permission to send reminders.

Like, _âHey, you said youâd do X by today, and you didnât, so Iâm
following up.â_

They devolve into an administrative hassle, not a strategic asset, for the
buyer.

Use MAPs more strategically with your champions by looking for:

  * **Common sources of friction.**  

Look at MAPs across all deals in your pipeline. If most deals slow down at a
certain step, proactively suggest:_âHey, this is where the process tends to
go off the rails. How could we keep the team motivated this week?â_

  * **Specific owners who keep dropping the ball.**  

If youâre off track because a certain owner or team is consistently behind
on following through, call this out:_âIt seems like < owner > is either
swamped, or uncertain of the plan here. How do you think we should address
that?â_

  * **Opportunities to work as a team.**  

Shift and share tasks that are pacing behind. For example, if you see your
champion struggling to get a conversation with Finance on the books,
ask:_âHey, how about I draft that email for finance with our cost
projections, for you to forward on?â_

Finally, try using the âProcess Feedbackâ email inside these [12 mid-
funnel emails](https://www.fluint.io/resources/mid-funnel-email-frameworks)
with your past champions, to build out the baseline MAP youâre starting
