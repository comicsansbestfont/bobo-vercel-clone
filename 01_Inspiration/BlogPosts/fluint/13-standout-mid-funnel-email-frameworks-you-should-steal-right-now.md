Emails make up the majority of your buyerâs experience in between sales
meetings. Whatâs more, the bar for what a buyer considers a thoughtful email
goes up as the cycle goes on.

**Yet, the typical mid-funnel email is totally forgettable. It blends in, when
it should stand out.**

Thatâs because most reps build them with tired old templates, stale
snippets, and stock phrases.

**All of this means mediocre email content defines a large chunk of the
buyerâs experience.**

But you can change that. For your buyers âÂ and your win rate. Reading this
post will give you:

  1. A refreshed set of mid-funnel email frameworks to use right now.
  2. The principles behind them, so you know how to adapt them long-term.

Here we go. A mid-funnel email playbook you should steal.

## 1/ The Discovery Preview Email

Your prospecting email worked its magic. Now, you need your prospect to
actually show up.

Their interest in giving you their time for a discovery call has likely
decreased â not increased â since confirming your meeting time. This
framework will build up their interest again by:

  * Focusing on an outcome, not an agenda, a-la-[Kyle Asay](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-library-of-uncommon-sales-practices#set-objectives-not-agendas).
  * Previewing a non-obvious insight to pique their curiosity.  
â

##  
2/ The Problem & Approach Email

During your first discovery conversations, you should be [asking questions to
understand](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-ask-better-questions-a-roadmap-
for-more-powerful-discovery):

  * Where your buyer is today: a problem.
  * Where your buyer wants to be tomorrow: a payoff.
  * The process to move them from problem, to payoff.

This email uses your [buyerâs words](https://www.fluint.io/how-it-works) to
play back these points, ensure they feel heard, and showcase _their_ logic for
why they should move forward with another call.

**The four steps in the framework are:**

  1. A clear [problem statement](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-build-a-compelling-problem-statement-case-study).
  2. How they want to [approach](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-avoid-screwing-up-executive-level-sales-meetings#:~:text=Frame%20Up%20the%20Decision%20Path) the problem.
  3. What [needs to be true](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-enterprise-sales-playbook#establish-problem-product-fit) of a solution for it to fit.
  4. Next steps, referencing a colleague whoâs impacted.

**Here's how it reads:**

## 3/ The âMad Libsâ Post-Demo Email

If you joined [Lavender Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC-KoNoqbBw)
with me and [Will Allred](https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamallred/), you saw
us breakdown the typical post-demo email. A stack of links, padded with
pleasant comments.

â**Hereâs the âBefore.â**

**The problem with this email is:**

**The way it reads to your buyer is:Â**

>  _Hi guys, this email took two minutes to generate because itâs a
> template.  
>  
>  But Iâll insert some nice language about how fun it was to talk.  
>  
> Also, hereâs a recap of my product:  
>  
> \- Product deck link  
> \- Case study link  
> \- Case study link  
>  
> Thanks for digging through these links.  
>  
> Hopefully you can hunt down some takeaways from them.  
>  
> Also, please translate this into a new message your team will read.  
>  
> Thanks, and hope to close you soon,  
>  
> -Rep_â

If that sounds a bit harsh, that's the idea. You're capable of writing a far
more effective email.

The way to do it? Pair your buyerâs words, captured in thoughtful notes,
with this framework.

Think of it like that old game, [Mad Libs](https://www.madlibs.com/). Youâre
filling in a storyline that builds up a greater level of emotional tension in
your reader.

**Here are the five parts to the Mad Libs framework, plus a good example of
the âAfterâ email.**

## 4/ The Forwardable Email to Help You Multithread

Most reps send emails **_to_** their champions, when they should send themÂ **
_through_** Â their champions. Forwardable Emails are the way you'll do this.

This framework packages up your message so it's easy to forward along and:

  * Loop in key contacts to expand your reach and multithread.
  * Ensure your email is read by making the sender internal.

**The 5 steps in this framework are:**

  1. Open up with a company-wide initiative.
  2. Reference [a trigger phrase](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-ask-better-questions-a-roadmap-for-more-powerful-discovery#:~:text=Identify%20Trigger%20Phrases%3A) thatâs familiar.
  3. Stir up emotion using [visual language](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-in-enterprise-sales-how-to-craft-internal-narratives#:~:text=and%20musical%20language.-,Visual%20language,-uses%20metaphors%2C%20similes).
  4. Create tension through a challenge.
  5. Match your ask to the deciderâs job.

Hereâs an example of how this might read for a rep selling an SEO content
solution:

## 5/ The âIdeaâ Email That Stops Ghosting

This may surprise you, but buyers don't forget you sell a product. So they
don't need the reminder in your follow-up emails. If your emails reference...

  * Reviewing that proposal
  * Scheduling with the SVP
  * Booking another demo

...and you're not getting any response, then try this 'Idea Email'.

The difference is this email focuses on helping buyers get their job done
today. Before they buy. You'll find that afterwards, they're more interested
in hearing about the next steps in the deal.

**The five elements in this framework are:**

  1. Recall a past topic.
  2. Align it with a tool or idea.
  3. Confirm this is still a priority.
  4. Give proof your idea is helpful.

**Here's how it reads:Â**

â

## 6/ The âI Spent an Unreasonable Amount of Time on Thisâ Email

If you never feel youâre spending an unreasonable amount of time writing
follow-up emails to your pipeline, then head's up. Youâre doing it wrong.

**Here are three examples of what I mean. The first two are reasonable. The
last one isn't.  
â**

**ð´ The 50%-to-Quota Rep writes:**

> _Hey, just wanted to follow up on meeting again.  
>  
>  You were thinking youâd have reviewed our deck by now?_

â

**ð¡ The 75%-to-Quota Rep writes:**

> _Hey, thought youâd like this whitepaper.  
>  
>  It has some pretty interesting findings in there.  
>  
> By the way, when are you free to meet and review our deck?_

â

**ð¢ The 150%-to-Quota Rep writes:**

> _Hey, just read this 30-page whitepaper and had an idea.  
>  
>  Here's a copy, with the key takeaways highlighted for you.  
>  
> I mapped the 3 main points, to 3 new slides in this deck we can build out
> together (and applied a media kit I found to brand it for you).  
>  
> Think it's something we can get your team's feedback on it?_

While writing up this last example, youâll question yourself. Youâll
think, _"Does it really make sense to spend this much time, writing this one
email?"_

Optimizing your follow-upâs so they donât cost you too much time is
reasonable. But that gets you to the exact same place as your competitors.

On the flip-side, [Costly Signaling
Theory](https://marketingexamples.com/sales/signalling) says the more it costs
you to communicate something, the better your message will land.  
â

## 7/ The No-Reply-Required Email

Ideally, an executive Â early on. Theyâll introduce you to their team, and
youâll want to keep them in the loop on your progress after â but without
the burden of a reply.

This oneâs pretty short and sweet. Hereâs how it reads:

â

## 8/ The Creating-Action-from-Consensus Email

Complex deals arenât complex because of the [contract
size](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-inner-life-of-the-enterprise-10-concepts-
for-developing-large-deals). Itâs the number of contacts involved, plus the
need to create consensus from multiple sets ofÂ [priorities and
incentives](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-map-b2b-decision-makers-
enterprise-account-maps-that-actually-help-win-
deals#:~:text=a%20short%20profile%20for%20each%20contact%20with%20three%20points%20noted).

When you see a way to tie together multiple goals in the buying committee, use
this framework:

  1. Develop [urgency](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-one-guaranteed-way-to-trigger-urgency-in-b2b-sales) by referencing a shared date or deadline.
  2. Connect that date back to each buyerâs personal goals.
  3. Link both of their goals together, using your product.

Hereâs an example, where James is the Head of Sales, and Daniel is the Head
of Marketing.

â

## 9/ The Account Team -> Rep -> Buyer Email

This one is crazy effective when executed well, and to genuinely help.

**Here's how to use it for high-value, late-stage deals:**

  1. Partner with your account team (could be a CSM, AM, or solutions engineer).
  2. Pick a few late-stage deals and detail the customer's current state.
  3. Find one way you both can help the buyer today.
  4. Give your team this email to send to you (the rep).
  5. Forward that email on to your buyer.

**It's effective because:**

  * I can almost guarantee no competitor is doing this.
  * It shows your buyers there's a whole team thinking about them.
  * It actually "adds value" by helping buyers get a job done.
  * It sets up a smooth handoff and implementation.

Hereâs an example. Let's say you work with an operations team who doesn't
have a master data hierarchy. Which throws off their segmentation and causes
all kinds of issues. So you and your team modify a sample from another account
and schedule a working session to refine it.  
â

By the way, if you want to use thisÂ for multiple deals, use some of your
commission check to send your colleague dinner. Or something to say you
appreciate them, and their teamwork.

## 10/ The âDonât Handle Objections Over Email,â Email

If youâre hit with an objection over email, itâs never ideal to
âhandleâ it before understanding the true issue more deeply.

So the goal of this framework is to setup a call, while **signaling youâre
there to listen from a collaborative, curious posture.** It works by:

  1. Showing youâre grateful theyâve raised an issue (instead of ghosting).
  2. âActively readingâ to isolate the objection into one core concern.
  3. Seeking to understand, before jumping right into a solution.

Here's an example of how this reads:

â

## 11/ The âIâm Behind on My Email,â Email

Here's one of the more underrated follow-up emails.

Sometimes, you need a little extra time to be thoughtful, so use this email as
an alternative to:

  1. Sending an uninspiring, default template on-time.
  2. Sending a killer follow-up that's way late.

Really, this framework is just about communicating consistently. When you do,
your message always lands. (As long as you don't use this one multiple times
on the same account...)

â

## 12/ The Contract & Pricing Review Email

Should you send out your pricing over an email? The classic answer is, âit
depends.â

  * If you have a simple pricing model spelled out on your website, then yes.
  * If itâs a complex model with multiple drivers and options, then no.

Iâm guessing many of you reading this fall into the second case, so hereâs
your framework.

**It's called the "4A's."**

  1. Acknowledge the groupâs needs.
  2. Affirm the goals of your pricing structure.
  3. Ask for feedback on the options created.
  4. Align with the right contacts in a conversation.

**Here's how it reads:  
â**

By the way, when procurement hasnât been involved yet, add a spin on this
email by saying:

> _Weâre both looking to setup a long-term relationship, and Iâm sure your
> procurement team can help align our contract details with their vendor
> strategy.  
>  
>  Could we invite them, too?_â

Youâll eventually need to meet with them. So why not invite the conversation
up front?  
â

## 13/ The New Customer Feedback Email

At the risk of overstating it, this email can change the way you sell.

Itâs fairly common to ask buyers for their âdecision process,' and what
they let you see is helpful. But itâs what you _donât_ see about [the way
your buyers buy](https://www.fluint.io/post/designing-a-sale-around-buying-
behaviors-two-shifts-that-win-deals) thatâs most valuable.

**Hereâs how to learn how your buyer's âinternal saleâ really goes
down:**

  1. Pick a deal that closed recently. Make sure you had an open, transparent champion.
  2. Write up the decision process you know, from what you heard and helped with.
  3. Ask your champion to point out any gaps. What did they do, that you didnât see?

What you find will be fascinating.

## Final Thoughts on Writing Well

### 1/ Make sure your follow-up can pass this workflow.

If you want a detailed breakdown on each step, download theÂ [Forward-Worthy
Follow-Up Guide.](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-forward-worthy-follow-
up-guide)

###  
2/ Ask your internal team to critique your emails.

Your own team is filled with people who think like and do the same job as your
prospects. Plus, they have a natural incentive to help you improve your
messaging.

So the idea here is:

  * Selling to developers? Show your developers.
  * Selling to marketing? Show your marketers.
  * Selling to finance? Show your finance team.
  * Selling to HR? Show your HR team.
  * Selling to CS? Show your CS team.
  * And so on.

###  
3/ The top thing to remember when emailing execs.

They're reading your email during another conversation.

Which means youâll only get a fraction of their full attention. They fit in
a few emails here and there, while on a call that's running long, or in a
meeting that doesn't need 100% focus.

**This means itâs critical to:**

  * Put the bottom line up front (BLUF).
  * Make it easy to forward to someone else.
  * Write [like a 5th-grader talks](https://top1.fm/DailySalesTips/sales-tip-846-reduce-writing-complexity-will-allred/). Simple and easy.
