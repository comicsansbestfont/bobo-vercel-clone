If you havenât experienced this, itâs kinda hard to explain:

â**Writing a business case is _the best_ way to sharpen your discovery.**â

It's also the #1 thing AE's realize when they try it for the first time:_â_

 _âWoah, my discovery is 10X more crisp now.â_

But the link between writing and discovery isn't super obvious. In fact, it's
usually a reality that's hidden from anyone who hasn't tried this before.

**Here's why this link is so strong. Writing immediately clarifies:**

  1. What you already knew, but didnât realize.
  2. What you donât yet know, but need to.

Here's what IÂ mean.  
â

## Your Business CaseÂ  _=_ Your Discovery Roadmap

The process of writing a business case = a good frameworkÂ + your buyerâs
words.

It's a process of filling in the blanks, kind of like that game, Mad Libs.

When you approach your business case this way, you'll quickly see where you
don't have enough inputs to complete the framework.

Where are the gaps that you need to fill in, together, with deeper discovery?

**In other words, a solid business case framework gives you a point of view
on:**

  * When to linger on a topic vs. when to push ahead.
  * Where gaps and assumptions still exist in the storyline.
  * Whether the input youâve gathered is compelling, or not.

## Finding Discovery Gaps with Business Case Drafts

This idea is a sub-point below our overall point-of-view:Â [the business case
_is_ the sales process.](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-business-case-is-the-
sales-process)

Which guides the way we're developing what Fluint users experience daily:  
â

  1. **End your very first discovery call with a first draft.Â**  

You won't have 100% of the inputs you need. But getting something down on
paper kicks off how you'll [create champions](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-
build-test-loop-how-to-create-an-insanely-committed-champion-while-co-
creating-business-cases).  
â

  2. **Write your first drafts withÂ each buyer's own words.**  

Instead of templated marketing speak. To encourage more collaboration and that
feeling, "Finally, someone who gets me."  
â

  3. **Tailor your discovery based on gaps in your first draft.**  

Check out the image below. The left side compares the business case on the
right (which Fluint draftedÂ using what was available in call transcripts), to
a set of best practices.  

Are there numbers in the problem statement, for example?Â If not, what
question should you ask in your next call, to develop the message?

## **  
The DIYÂ Exercise for Your Next SKO**

You can also give this a shot the good old fashioned way, using this exercise.
Because again, this is one of those things you need to _experience._ â

Incorporate it into your next team meeting, training event, or an SKO.

**Here's how it works:**

1/ Grab this framework, The 1-Page Business Case:

[](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ctvfdHRoRxdH87W7GlfKqQWOn0PbtrMjToHvD0x7DQc/edit#)

2/ Pick out two or three deals in your pipeline.

3/ Using _only the inputs you have now_ , [fill in as much of the
framework](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-in-
enterprise-sales-how-to-craft-internal-narratives) as you can.

4/ Highlight the gaps. Then [share the draft with your
champion](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-sell-with-champions-ask-them-to-
do-the-heavy-lifting-4-example-questions).

5/ [Fill them in together](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-build-test-loop-how-
to-create-an-insanely-committed-champion-while-co-creating-business-cases).
Then, point out the remaining gaps.

6/ Tag in [someone else on their team](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-
multithread-navigate-dysfunctional-buying-groups-in-enterprise-sales) to help
fill those in.

â

The TL;DR:

Starting with [a point-of-view](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-craft-
executive-level-points-of-view-frameworks-for-strategic-reps), guided by a
good business case framework, helps you go deep in discovery.
