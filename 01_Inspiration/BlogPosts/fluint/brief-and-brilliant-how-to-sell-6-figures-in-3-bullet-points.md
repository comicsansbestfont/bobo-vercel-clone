"I donât read PowerPoint decks. Just give me 3 really good bullet points."

That's what [Gregg Scoresby](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greggscoresby/) said
while I was sitting in the PHX Ventures conference room late last year.

I was asking how he bought software as the CEO at CampusLogic ($197M raised,
successful exit), before starting their Venture fund.

(After that meeting, [PHX Ventures](https://phxventures.com/) became an
investor in Fluint ð)

As just one example, he described how his team sold him on a major, 6-figure
purchase with Gainsight. To help build their customer success approach.

**They gave him 3 crisp bullet points that included:**

  1. Why was investing in the overall category a pressing need, now?
  2. How, specifically, would they measure its impact on a major CL initiative? 
  3. Who else did he personally know that had successfully rolled out Gainsight?

**So his decision to invest in Gainsight was based on:**

  * 3 bullet points, not 30 slides.
  * A single page, not a PowerPoint.
  * All the research and intention from his team.

In other words, if you only have 3 bullet points to land your message, youâd
better get them right.

Youâd need to do _more_ discovery and editing â not less. Which is the
funny reality of [selling to executives](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-
avoid-screwing-up-executive-level-sales-meetings):

Your #1 job is to [compress the deal into short
soundbites](https://www.fluint.io/post/selling-in-soundbites-how-to-sell-more-
by-saying-less).

To [avoid diluting your message](https://www.fluint.io/post/minimum-viable-
sentences-a-framework-for-crazy-productive-sales-conversations), while making
the most of a short few minutes.

This isnât just a âGreggâ thing, by the way. This is an executive thing.
Your deal will _always_ comes down to just a few, short sentences.

Do you know which soundbites your champions are selling with?

## The Anatomy of Effective Bullet Point

Neil deGrasse Tyson has figured out the practice of communicating in bullet
points. Short, quotable soundbites that grab and hold attention.

But that wasnât always the case:

In 1995, he became the interim director of the American Museum of Natural
History. The same year the science community had a big breakthrough:

They discovered the first ever planet orbiting a star, which wasnât the sun.

So NBC approached him for an interview. Excited, he gave his best
âprofessorial reply,â then ran home to catch the interview on TV.

**But they cut out almost all of his interview.**

Instead, all they left was a single soundbite and him doing a hula hoop dance
to describe the planetâs orbit.

Which lead to an âahaâ moment:

> ââ¦even though they're interviewing me in my place, it's actually for
> them, in their place. And in their place, soundbites rule.

So I said, rather than have them soundbite me, why don't I hand them
soundbites? They can't edit that. They gotta use them as soundbites.â

So whatâd he decide to do?

> I just barked out Saturn, rings, black hole, Big Bang, Alpha Centauriâ¦ and
> for every one of those words, I said what are three sentences I can put
> together that are informative, make you smile, and are so tasty you might
> want to tell someone else?

There is the anatomy of a soundbite.

He cut out the full âscience curriculumâ in his messaging. Instead, he:

  * Identified a series of _single words_ that captured his big ideas.
  * He crafted three simple sentences (bullet points) for each.
  * He made sure each bullet was, (1) informative (2) delightful (3) shareable.

[In the full interview here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLT1xpbTvZw), you
can hear him say:

> A soundbite is useful because it triggers interest in someone, who then goes
> and puts in the effort to learn moreâ¦

Take the moment to stimulate interest, and upon doing that you have set a
learning path into motion that becomes self-driven because that soundbite was
_so tasty_ â why do you think we call them bites?

Applied to complex sales, the point isnât that you shouldnât create more
content than 3 bullets to help your champions sell.

You can and should. But things likeâ¦

  * ROI / financial models
  * Technical diagrams
  * Rollout plans

â¦donât matter without a few tasty soundbites to generate interest.

## How to Craft Snackable Soundbites

Weâll go back to Tyson here. Later in the interview, he says:

> I feel like Michelangelo who said, âWhen I make a sculpture, I just chisel
> away everything that isnât the man or the woman, and then thatâs
> whatâs left.â

The same idea applies to your writing.

So how do you create 3, tasty bullet points from an entire deck?

> You trim, you carve the words such that all thatâs left is the most
> important concept communicated in the simplest, most direct way.

You can âtrimâ your writing by taking a highlighter to your document:

(1) Highlight in Red everything thatâs **not** :

  * Adding a non-obvious or uncommon insight.
  * Surprising for the reader to see.
  * Shareable in a short tweet.

(2) Highlight in Green everything thatâs:

  * Data from the buying team.
  * Internal language specific to the account.
  * Directly edited or added by your champions.

(3) Highlight whatâs left in Yellow.

  * This is the stuff youâre not sure fits into either bucket.
  * Show it to a colleague or champion, and ask for Red vs. Green.

When youâre done, copy everything thatâs Green into another document.

Then, organize them into three bullet points.

If you need, you can use Greggâs framework from above:

  1. Why is investing in your overall product category a pressing need, now?
  2. How, specifically, will you measure your impact on a major executive initiative? 
  3. Who else can you reference in the customerâs space with a successful rollout?

If youâre using Fluint, you can ask the system to give you a little assist.

Youâll already have a head start by using the Business Case frameworks, to
turn all your notes, call transcripts, and research into a 1-Page draft:
