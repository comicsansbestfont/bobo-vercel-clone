Iâve concluded writing is the most highly-important, under-developed skill
for sales reps.

If you study standout reps landing six, then seven, then eight-figure deals,
youâll see a pattern. They all learn how to write compelling narratives.

They can distill hours of conversation into a page of content. Without seeming
to have left anything out. They can package their message so it spreads up,
down, all around an account.

**Yet, only a handful of sales teams train their reps on how to write.**

Instead, reps are given template emails, about-us decks, and content filled
with marketing speak. Which serve as fine starting points or supplements.

**But enablement content isnât a crutch that excuses sellers from writing.**

The reason is buying decisions arenât made in sales meetings â the moments
that decide deals happen in a buyerâs _internal_ meetings. When sales reps
arenât in the room.

Writing is how you bridge that gap, to control your message and enable your
champion.

**Therefore, writing isnât a âmarketingâ skill. Itâs one every
enterprise rep must master.**

## Internal narratives create and close deals.

When I talk about writing in the context of complex sales, Iâm not talking
about emails or product decks. Iâm referring to the art of crafting
_narratives._

**Because nothing happens in the enterprise without a strong narrative backing
it.**

Conflicting opinions, corporate politics, change avoidance â among many
other obstacles â all block enterprise projects. Narratives are how you
break through them.

**In short, narratives package ideas in a way others can understand, share and
act on them. Narratives bring meaning to goals, influence to decisions, and
alignment to teams.**

Corporate narratives are:

  * All around you.
  * As short as a sound bite, or as long as a six-page report.
  * Sticky and contagious. Everyone shares them, and they never forget them.
  * You can find them in the phrases that get repeated during every all-hands. Spot them by how executive updates are framed.

Narratives become internal, not external, when a buyer takes and shares it as
their own.

**This is key, because narratives never live alone. Projects only gain
momentum when theyâre connected to other stories inside a company. So think
of narratives like constellations â a wide system of related stories moving
together.**

Enterprise employees know their requests are either approved, or denied, based
on how well they can tie their narrative into other, already-accepted
narratives. For example:  
â

>  _âWe plant the seeds for an upsell, or churn in the first 30 days.â  
>  
> _ \- A VP of Success looking to resource their new accounts team, so they
> build a narrative that ties into the CROâs focus on net revenue retention
> (NRR).

â

>  _âEnterprise customers are the path to double-digit growth.â  
>  
> _ \- A CRO who needs marketing, sales, and success to support a move
> upmarket, so she ties her narrative into the CEOâs focus on showing
> double-digit monthly growth.

Think about it for a second. What are the narratives floating around your
company? Who created them? Whoâs sharing them around, and why?

## Focus on written content, not just conversations.

Narratives are both written and spoken. Often, they travel in both forms.

Thatâs why enterprise reps are ambidextrous. Like an actor who both writes
and delivers their own script, tops reps communicate as well in written
content as they do in conversation.

There are, however, several advantages to writing the narrative youâre
building with buyers:

  1. **Deliver the perfect message in a controlled environment.  
** Writing lets you lay out your message under the ideal conditions. Zero
stage fright, no interruptions, and an audienceâs undivided attention.
Youâre judged by your content, not your charisma.  
â

  2. **Writing prunes the excess.  
** Itâs easier to spot the details that are distracting, and disposable,
when you write. Points that arenât absolutely critical to your case get cut.  
â

  3. **Quickly bring new buyers up to speed.  
** Operating from a living document allows your message to evolve as more
buyers enter the sales process. Plus, it eliminates the âtelephone
effect,â giving context to the contacts who werenât part of past
conversations.  
â

  4. **Optimize for understanding.  
** If you want a decision maker to understand your message the first time,
have them read it. Reading requires focus. Itâs easier to zone in and out of
a rep presenting a deck or demo.  
â

  5. **Influence when youâre not in the room.  
** I mention this above, but itâs worth repeating. Buyers have meetings
about you, without you. Champions wonât read from your product deck in those
meetings. But they will share from a well-packaged memo you wrote with them.  
â

## Good writing is clear thinking made visible.

Thatâs a quote from Ambrose Bierce. He wrote it over 100 years ago.
Nothingâs changed.

If you learn to think like an executive, youâll write in a way that appeals
to an executive. The shortcut to thinking like an executive is developing a
set of mental models that can organize your point of view, before you write.  
â  

### 1\. The Minto Pyramid

This model is named after its creator, Barbara Minto, during her time working
at McKinsey. She describes it as, âA tool for logic in writing, to help you
find out what you think.â

The Pyramid helps you to settle on a set of ideas that are mutually exclusive
from each other, and collectively exhaustive in supporting one main point.

**Hereâs what the Pyramid looks like, and how to build it:**

  1. Start with a short, specific answer. Executives want the headline first.
  2. Summarize three arguments supporting your big idea.
  3. Logically order sub-points backing up those arguments.

A similar acronym to remember is BLUF: bottom line up front.

Hereâs an example of putting the bottom line up front (just donât copy all
this corporate jargon...).

###  
2\. Zoom Out, Zoom In

The Zoom Out, Zoom In model shifts a traditional one- or three-year narrative
to 10+ years (zoom out), and 6 months (zoom in). This makes it particularly
effective for players reshaping Â industries, and itâs been used to guide
the narratives of major tech firms and Silicon Valley legends.

To use the framework, answer two main questions:

  1. **Zoom Out:** What will your prospectâs market or industry look like in 10 years? In light of that, what kind of company do they need to become to be survive?  
â

  2. **Zoom In:** What project should be implemented inside the next 6 months to start shifting toward that future? And how will progress be measured?  
â

###  
3\. Driver Trees

Creating a clear plan for your buyer requires a deep understanding of how
their business works. What's their problemâs root cause, and what drives the
outcomes theyâre after?

Driver Trees model **the cause-and-effect relationships** behind a companyâs
Â metrics.

By linking âoutcomesâ to a series of âinputâ metrics, Driver Trees
simplify complex goals into their drivers. Just as the name suggests. On the
left side of the Tree, you list the target metric youâd like to influence.
The right side of the model shows you how.

##  
Focus on frameworks, not templates.

Once youâve clarified your thinking, itâs time to organize the broad
strokes of your narrative. This is where frameworks come in. They let you drop
new content into a consistent starting point.

A good framework sits somewhere in the middle of a:

  * **Blank Page**. This forces you to be specific for every buyer, but takes too much effort.
  * **Template**. Itâs fast and easy, but it sacrifices relevance and effectiveness.

Youâll want to develop a set of frameworks for the different roles,
industries, or solutions you sell.

To give you a starting point, hereâs The [1-Page Sales
Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ctvfdHRoRxdH87W7GlfKqQWOn0PbtrMjToHvD0x7DQc/).
It's built in a Google Doc, so you can download and adapt it for your own
pipeline.

Here are a few more pro-tips to use alongside this framework:

  * **Don't list your name as the author.** The point is to help your buyers craft their narrative.
  * **Start with a two-sentence headline.** Summarize your big idea, and create enough interest to compel your reader to keep reading. This also frames up the rest of your content.
  * **Keep it collaborative.** Use a tool like Notion, a simple Google Doc (or [Fluint](http://fluint.io/), of course) to write with your buyers. Involve them, donât write alone.

## How to shape sentences that sell.

With your framework in place, we arrive at the art of what most consider to be
âwriting.â Choosing words, and shaping sentences. Hereâs a shortlist of
practices to help you cook up some tasty content.  
â

### 1\. Use Your Buyerâs Own Words

Communication happens in your readerâs mind. Not yours as the writer. If
your buyers need to translate your jargon into something more familiar,
youâll lose their attention.

**The fast, failsafe approach to creating good content is to let your buyers
do the writing. Record and transcribe your conversations, then highlight
excerpts of**[**their exact words**](https://www.fluint.io/how-it-
works#:~:text=Build%20sales%20content%20with%20%C2%A0your%20buyer%27s%20own%20words.)**.**

If they use a specific word while describing their problem, use it. Especially
if itâs different from what other buyers say, while experiencing the exact
same problem.  
â

### 2\. Blend Ethos, Logos, and Pathos

Persuasive writing combines all three elements of rhetoric. Theyâve been
used for thousands of years to communicate and influence:

  * **Ethos** : credibility and trust. âTrust me, I've closed millions over a decade of experience.â
  * **Logos** : help your audience reach a conclusion before you do. âSuccessful peers have found a way to do, 1, 2, 3. Therefore, you shouldâ¦â
  * **Pathos** : create an emotional appeal. âHundreds of employees could lose their jobs.â  
â

### 3\. Create a masterpiece with visual and musical language.

**Visual language** uses metaphors, similes, or analogies to conjure up a
vivid mental picture:

  * âOur sales will ramp up faster than a Formula 1 driver in second place.â
  * âOur workflow is like trying to chop down a tree with a butter knife.â
  * âOur backlog of support tickets is longer than Apple before an iPhone release.â

**Musical language,** by contrast, uses tools like alliteration, word count,
and punctuation to make the page sing. As if your reader can hear the tone and
pace of your voice.

â

### 4\. Aim for Accuracy, Not Complexity

Use a thesaurus while you write. The goal is to choose words that communicate
your point exactly as youâd like to. Not to choose more sophisticated words.

To repeat: use words everyone knows, that more precisely describe your point.  
â

### 5\. Use headlines, bold, and bullets.

Nobody reads your sales materials from first to last word, in order. We work
our way down the page several different times, going slightly deeper on each
pass by working through:

  1. Headlines
  2. Bold and highlights
  3. Bullets and breakouts
  4. Full sentences in interesting sections
  5. The rest of the content for extra context

Youâve probably read this post this way. So use headers, highlights, bold
and bullets thoughtfully. Spend as much on this part as you do drafting your
content.
