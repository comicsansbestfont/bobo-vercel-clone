In just 60 seconds, I can tell you (with far more accuracy than your
forecasting platform) if your business case (and [therefore,
deal](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-business-case-is-the-sales-process)) is
going to get a decision â or get deleted.

Compared to the typical deal review and QBR conversation?

Thatâs about 59 minutes faster to make a closed-won-or-lost prediction.
Because let's just be honest: the typical deal review, QBR, and forecasting
meeting that forces reps to "defend" their deal is way too long, aimless, and
unproductive.

Now, when people hear me say all this, theyâre thinking something like:

âBut Nate, you donât know our product! You donât know our business!â

**Exactly. Thatâs the whole point.**

Your prospects donât either. So that executive youâre working to engage?
That committee youâre working to sway?

Theyâll spend, at most, 60 seconds entertaining your message. (Assuming it
even makes it to their inbox or meeting agenda.)

## How Hollywood Kills Screenplays (and Executives Kill Deals)

Thousands of screenplays are created every year. They take months and months
to write.

But just seconds to die.

When a new screenplayâs submitted for review â and hopefully, a big
studioâs investment to move into production â theyâll read the first and
last pages first:

  * The first page sets up who the main character is, in the beginning.
  * The last page tells you who theyâve become, at the end.
  * Together, these pages show how much theyâve changed.
  * If thereâs not enough change and contrast, itâs too boring.

_Delete_

The exact same thinking and review process happens inside your deals:

  * Is this character (project) interesting?
  * Is there enough contrast between today (current state, problem) and tomorrow (future state, payoff)?

If notâ¦ _delete_.

## The Universal Structure to Make Your Message Stick

This is the universal structure built into every single framework youâll
ever use.

Whether your prefer something like the [1-Page Business
Case](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-one-page-business-case), a
[Consulting-Style Summary](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-scr-framework),
[Value Story](https://www.fluint.io/resources/value-story-framework), etcâ¦
they all hinge on one big idea:

Creating contrast, to hook your audience. Thatâs what keeps deals from
slipping and stalling. And it keeps your message front and center during [the
buying team's internal conversations](https://www.fluint.io/resource-
content/introducing-sales-process-2-0-rewriting-the-sales-led-gtm-playbook).
(Even if you're not there to tell it.)

Using the language Nancy Duarte popularized in her research behind _Resonate,_
your message needs to outline:

It sucks you in, and keeps you locked in.

Itâs the universal âsparklineâ behind every story that sticks with us:

Now, donât miss this piece:

After you [clarify the difference between what is, and what could
be](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-design-a-value-based-sale-and-drive-
business-impact): âoscillateâ back and forth between these two states.

Thatâs what keeps our goldfish-length attention spans focused.

## The 5-Part Story Framework to Guide Your Next Business Case

Hereâs _how_ to do that. A 5-part story framework:

**1/ In the Beginning:**

Lead with a truth your buyers agree on. A priority theyâre already sold on.

Then, [describe their current reality](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-
build-a-compelling-problem-statement-case-study) in a way that feels crazy
accurate.

One that shows that [you "get it,"](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-ask-
better-questions-a-roadmap-for-more-powerful-discovery) and deeply understand
their context and core values in a way others donât.

**2/ Turning Point # 1**

Start contrasting "what is" vs. "what could be."

Make sure the difference between these is as wide as possible.

Your job is to create desire with an exciting vision of the future, then show
how your ideas fill that desire.

**3/ Middle:**

Your storyline has to raise the stakes here.

Whatâs it all for? Why not just keep living life as it is?

Then continue to alternate what is / could be / is / could be, etc. Constantly
creating and resolving [tension in your
emails](https://www.fluint.io/resources/mid-funnel-email-frameworks), business
cases, wherever youâre delivering your message.

**4/ Turning Point # 2:**

Make a clear call to action. What should people do? Beyond just âsigning the
contract,â whatâs required?

Continue to outline the reward thatâs waiting for them if they do.

**5/ Ending:**

Recap the big idea, and create a sense of calm confidence.

Not all of us see ourselves as [strong
writers](https://www.fluint.io/post/win-in-writing-copywriting-shortcuts-to-
accelerate-enterprise-deals).

So, if you need a little guidance while planning the broad strokes to your
storyline, to guide how you craft the [rest of the narrative behind your
deal](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-in-enterprise-
sales-how-to-craft-internal-narratives), check out this worksheet:

[](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-60-second-deal-review)

Notice how the first 3 bullet points above, the headlines, include each story
element:

  * Beginning (what is)
  * Middle (buying journey)
  * End (what could be)

Also notice how this checklist is based the [Sales Process 2.0
playbook](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/introducing-sales-
process-2-0-rewriting-the-sales-led-gtm-playbook) and
[stages](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-complete-1-sheet-sales-process).
Which lets you test whether:

  1. Youâre aligning your sales process to the buyerâs journey.
  2. Theyâre actually making progress on that journey with you.

## Clues to Look for In Deal Reviews

So, back to deal reviews.

Assuming youâve actually [documented the
narrative](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/introducing-sales-
process-2-0-rewriting-the-sales-led-gtm-playbook#business-cases-are-written-
content-documented) behind your deal â vs. recycling the same template decks
and case studies â then, deal reviews are radically simplified. Sales
leaders, youâre looking for a couple points:

  1. **The Big Idea:**

Do your first and last sentences grab and hold attention? Can you understand
why this matters inside no more than 3 sentences?

Is the big idea vague, unclear, or uninteresting?

  2. **Edits:**

How many edits did our champions make to our messaging? Is this still our
storyline, or _theirs_? Are they [building
ownership](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-build-test-loop-how-to-create-an-
insanely-committed-champion-while-co-creating-business-cases) in the deal?

Look for redlines, comments, and the amount of change between V1 and V2 of the
message. No changes? No comments? Weâre not there yet.

  3. **Value:**

Whatâs the size of the gap between current and future states? Are the stakes
high enough to get above director level? For example:

  * Workflow efficiency = Manager
  * MQLâs Generated = Director
  * Qualified Pipeline = VP
  * CAC = CMO

  4. **Numbers & Dates**

How specific are we going? Are we using the customers own data?

Do we have dates in a go-live plan, and specific numbers inside our problem
and payoff statements?

(Deals with numbers in a problem statement close at 3X the rate of those
without numbers â Fluint data.)

  5. **Unique Language**

Who is this written to sound like? Are we using our language and stuff
straight from a âbrand guideâ or âpersonaâ chart?

Or, is the language so ânativeâ that itâll read as if our champions
wrote it themselves? So specific that itâd be âweirdâ to send this to
another account?

Review enough deals, and you can spot all this inside 60 seconds, with [just a
single page](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/introducing-sales-
process-2-0-rewriting-the-sales-led-gtm-playbook#what-exactly-is-a-business-
case-not). What youâll find, too, is that the seller who hasnâtâ¦

â¦will instead forcing their buyer to do all that work.

And ultimately, they wonât make it out of the 60-second deal review and into
the forecast.

## Itâs About People, not Products

One footnote Iâll add to this structure:

Good stories arenât all âproducts.â Theyâre all people.

They're about who weâre becoming, because what hooks us is always a matter
of _identity_.

Which is what the Heath Brothers describe in their book _Switch._ We all
follow a âidentity decision-making model.â Where we ask ourselves three
questions:

  1. Who am I?
  2. What kind of situation is this?
  3. What would someone like me do in this situation?

Which goes something like this:

  1. Iâm a leader who cares about my people.
  2. Weâre expanding internationally, and acquiring more companies. Creating a clash between cultures and lots of people change.
  3. Listen deeply to employee feedback, directly from our frontline staff.

This third question is where your message comes in with:

  * Less, "send multichannel employee surveys via email, text, and social.â
  * More, "become a caring leader by measuring the human experience."

So, ask yourself:

  * Does your message sound like the first bullet point, or the second?
  * If your deal was a screenplay, would it make it out of the first-page-last-page test? Or would it die, right then, after a 60-second look?
