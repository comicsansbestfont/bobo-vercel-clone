**Most sellers have never been buyers.**

So naturally, how they sell lacks a certain level of "depth."

Which isn't necessarily a _bad_ thing if this is you â itâs just part of
gaining experience.

**On the flip side, when you buy, you gain an edge in how you sell.**

Thereâs a new texture you can _feel_ inside your conversations.

Itâs like the difference between watching someone ski, and actually feeling
how awkward it can be to have a pair of slippery planks stuck to your feet.

A highlight of my year has been working with sales reps who are âskiingâ
for the first time, by championing
[Fluint](https://www.fluint.io/video/fluint-demo-and-product-walkthrough). (We
launched a [product-led motion focused on
AEâs](http://www.fluint.io/pricing) first, then layered in team deals with a
focus on selling to CROâs and VPâs.)

Along the way, I've been asking how theyâll sell differently after buying.

And Iâve saved excerpts from those transcripts with their answers: **what
they said they knew, but didnât _really know,_ about selling.**

Hereâs a summary of the top points they shared:

## **7 Nonobvious Points on Selling from First-Time Buyers**

Sidebar: I wholly appreciate the irony behind _reading_ a post thatâs about
the difference between watching and experiencing something. So if youâve
never led a buying process before, try it.

Define a problem, develop a buying group, join demoâs, etc.

(You can alwaysÂ [start here](https://www.fluint.io/video/fluint-demo-and-
product-walkthrough)... just sayin'.)

Okay. On to the points:  
â

### **1/ Influence and titles are _not_ the same thing.**

> "All our sales trainings talk about selling to buyers above vs. below the
> âpower line.â  
>  
> And I thought this meant if I was talking to a high-level title, I was above
> the line:"

â

> "But now I realize that depending on the company, some individual
> contributors or managers can carry more influence than a director or even a
> VP."

**  
Related, hereâs a message from an AE who**[**changed his companyâs sales
process**](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-business-case-is-the-sales-
process)**:**

**  
The reason?**

A deal he was confident would close got shot down by the exec. (Ever had that
happen to you? Yeah, me too.)

So he turned a, "No, we're not doing that," into a heckâuva quarter, after
building a written business case with his champion.

**Now, his SVP + CRO are having him:**

  * Expand the process to everyone in a revenue org of 75 people
  * Teach other AE's how he did it during their QBRs
  * Repeat the process on higher-value deals

Some reps aren't thrilled by the "extra work" now... so he's anonymous here.

**But if you're a rep who's in the same spot right now, hear this:**

_You_ can be the one to change how your company operates. (Which can also
change the trajectory of your career.)

**2/ âChange managementâ is a real thing.**  
â

> "I spent _way_ more time talking to my own team about how weâll rollout

> features we need.  
>  
> Probably 70% of our conversations were about that. But compared to how I run

###  
**3/ Business âinitiativesâ before all else.**  
â

> "Itâs been interesting to realize how often my own companyâs executives
> repeat the same stuff, over and over again.  
>  
> Like, they only care about a really small number of initiatives and they go

>  
> In my CROâs case, it was his initiative to shift us to âvalue

> was easier than I expected. He even told us to double our budget for extra
> support, because _underinvesting_ was his bigger concern.  
>  
> So now, when I feel like a conversation is too hard â like when Iâm
> getting a lot of pricing pushback â I go back to the initiative. Have I
> found one? Am I selling with that? Or are people focused on other things?"

###  
**4/ Most discovery doesnât advance the deal.  
â**

> âI typically ask questions that donât ruffle any feathers. Theyâre
> easy to answer, and make me feel like weâre âgetting along.â  
>  
> But the questions Iâm most nervous to ask are the ones I appreciated being
> asked. The questions like, âWhy not just table this, and come back to it
> next year?â  
>  
> That helped me step back and think about what I needed to tell others in my
> company to keep the deal moving on the inside.â

###  
**5/ Thereâs a right and wrong order when multithreading.  
â**

> "I always thought multithreading was about adding more contacts into a deal.
> Circling the right contacts on the account map, and then going after them:

â

> "But when I was on the other side, I thought more about the order of who to
> bring in. There was a sequence to who I needed to get buy-in from first,
> because then, it was that much easier to get others looped in."

###  
**6/ Defining a problem is harder than I thought.  
â**

> âWhat I thought was pretty cut and dry was up for all kinds of debate. It
> was wild to hear the people I work with, who all experience the same thing,
> define the problem in so many different ways.  
>  
> Like, âlosing dealsâ is not actually a problem. **Why** we lost deals

>  
> Even measuring how many deals we lost youâd think was black and white. But

7/ Most follow-up puts the work on the buyer.  
â**

> "I realize that when something feels easy for me, Iâm making it harder for
> my buyer.  
>  
> My follow-up emails were all templated before, and I had a page of a bunch
> of product decks, demo recordings, case studies, the works.

> But I realized all Iâm looking for was a short, simple email saying
> âThis is why you should care, and hereâs what Iâm asking.â Attaching
> no more than a page of stuff.

> Because I will literally never use a 40-slide deck in my team meetingsâ¦ so

At the end of the day, âbuyingâ is just selling to your own team.

So if youâve never bought before, pick a problem at your company then go
solve it.

Itâll probably teach you more about selling than the typical SKOâ¦

(Including why a lot of deals end in doing nothing.)
