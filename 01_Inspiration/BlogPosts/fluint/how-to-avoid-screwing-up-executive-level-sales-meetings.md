Executive meetings are high stakes. I mean, have you _really_ sold enterprise
if youâve never sweat through your shirt during an exec-level meeting?****

Itâs rare for an enterprise rep to spend more than an hour or two with an
executive. Yet, every minute together plays an outsized role in the dealâs
outcome.

**This combo of limited time and large influence makes for high anxiety, and
low confidence.**

Iâve screwed up my fair share of those precious minutes with executives. So
hereâs an end-to-end process Iâve developed along the way, to help you
nail your next exec-level meeting.  
â

## The Value of an Executive Minute

First, recognize that each minute you spend with an executive is worth _16X
more_ than the minutes you'll spend with the rest of the buying team.

Hereâs the math behind this, using two different examples.

  * **In the first deal,** the execâs involvement follows the Pareto rule. You spend 20% of your sales time with the person who holds 80% of the decision power.  
â

  * **In the second deal,** the exec is less involved. They spend less time in the deal, and delegate more of the decision to their team.

If you look at the ratio of "influence-to-time" in these examples, hereâs
how it works out:

So, itâs fair to say exec-level interactions are at least 10X more powerful
in closing deals. Often as high as 16X more powerful.

The logical question, then, is how do you make the most of those minutes?

## Five Pre-Meeting Must-Doâs

Fail to plan, plan to fail, as the saying goes. So here are fives steps to
make sure you're ready for your next executive meeting.  
â

### 1/ Build a compelling narrative with your champion.

Executives are in the business of setting a big vision, and seeing it through.
They do this by crafting and communicating [internal
narratives](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-in-
enterprise-sales-how-to-craft-internal-
narratives#:~:text=Internal%20narratives%20create%20and%20close%20deals).

Youâll want to be ready with your own narrative, to speak and operate on
their level. Narratives transcend products to focus on bigger priorities like:

  * Seismic shifts in an industry
  * Looming and existential risks
  * Massive, untapped opportunities

If an executive isnât intrigued by your high-level narrative, they wonât
go deeper on how to operationalize it (with your product). The key here is to
link your narrative to existing stories or â[Trigger
Phrases](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-ask-better-questions-a-roadmap-for-
more-powerful-discovery#:~:text=Identify%20Trigger%20Phrases%3A)â theyâre
already sold on.  
â

### 2/ Compress your narrative into a strategic soundbite.

Enterprise reps become crazy good at distilling lots of information into a few
sentences.

No matter how complex the topic, or short the meeting. They can deliver their
core message in two to three sentences, max.

This helps their message travel. Think of this like compressing a 100 MB file
down to 10 MB. You can send it over email, without losing any context,
quality, or clarity.

The way to do this with your message is creating a âstrategic soundbite.â

This soundbite is the single, most important thing you want the executive to
hear and retain.  
â

### 3/ Follow the 25% rule for material prep.

Any materials youâre creating (re: above) should take roughly 25% of the
meeting time.

For an hourlong meeting, thatâs 15 minutes. Or seven minutes for a standard,
30-minute call.

Thatâs because meetings with executives will likely go off-agenda.
Executives almost always have opinions about where they'd like to take the
conversation once it gets rolling.  
â

### 4/ Lock down the executive whispererâs support.

A small handful of people typically hold a "no-questions-asked" level of trust
with executives.

If they nod âyesâ during your meeting, it gives the executive confidence
to push forward. They'll grow committed to exploring your project more deeply.

If you donât get the nod, well, get ready for an uphill battle.

If the exec whisperer isnât already your champion, meet them ahead of time
to discuss:

> _What area of this project gives you most concern?  
>  
>  If it were to go off the rails, why do you think that would be?_

###  
5/ Attach a short memo to the invite as a pre-read.

I _strongly_ encourage writing down your [business
case](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-one-page-business-case). When an
executive reads your message, youâre judged by your content, not your
charisma or delivery.

An Executive Assistant taught me one of my favorite sales practices for this.
It's helped me win a multi-year deal with a Top 5 insurance SVP.

Here's how it works:

  1. Set the calendar invite to start at :05 after.
  2. Attach your 1-page business case to the invite.
  3. Let the EA know there's a pre-read in the invite.
  4. Join the call at :05 after and dig in together.

The other reason this works?

**Executives are sharp. They think clearly, and process information far faster
than the pace of a typical sales conversation.**

Sharing a pre-read (without expecting any "homework" to be done), tees up the
topic so you can both drive toward what's most important. Not every executive
will be a fan, so ask their assistant or your champion while setting up the
invite.  
â

## A Minute-by-Minute Meeting Breakdown

Iâm a fan of [Kyle Asay's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyleasay/) saying,
âOutcomes, not agendas.â

Overall, you want to ensure each minute of your meeting drives toward a
specific outcome the executive cares about. Here's how to structure your time
together, to move toward that outcome.  
â

### Deliver a Non-Obvious Insight

(**Minutes** :**00 - :05)**

Executives decide whether youâre more or less interesting than the other
topics and priorities on their mind during the first minutes of your meeting.

**This means you need to earn their attention, fast.**

Delivering a different and non-obvious take on a topic they care about is how
youâll do this.

This is first done in your pre-read (step 5 of prep). Itâs also baked into
your narrative (step 1 above). But to be sure you can hold their
attention,**fill in this sentence:  
â**

>  _Most people believe _________, but actually, ___________._

###  
Adapt to Their Quirks

(**Minutes** :**05 - :10)**

Every executive is a little odd in their own way. They develop a certain style
of working over the years. Your job is to understand and adapt to those
quirks.

For example, Iâve had meetings with executives who:

  * **Cut me off, constantly.** A CEO of a large payments platform would show he was engaged by trying to finish my sentences. He wasnât rude. He was excited. So I learned to speak in [short, fast sentences](https://www.fluint.io/post/minimum-viable-sentences-a-framework-for-crazy-productive-sales-conversations) to let him jump in.  
â

  * **Refused to look at slides.** She sat with her back to the screen in the conference room. Eventually, she asked me to shut down the screen share altogether. She was more interested in hearing the heart of my message than seeing any visuals supporting it.  
â

  * **Objected to everything.** Especially the points he agreed with. He was an intellectual, who wanted to explore the boundaries of othersâ opinions. So it was impossible to get through a meeting without feeling like youâd failed, completely.

The next time you feel your discussion is going off the rails, consider that
every meeting with the executive may unfold that way.

If youâre still not sure how to adapt to their style, **try posing a
question to your champion to watch how they interact**. Then follow their
lead.  
â

### Confirm or Correct Your Narrative

(**Minutes :10 - :20)**

At this point, youâre deep enough into the conversation that youâll start
uncovering what the executive thinks. Your goal is to figure out what in your
initial point of view they:

  1. **Confirm.** Whatâs resonating, and what theyâre onboard with.
  2. **Correct.** What they disagree with, and why. 

Either outcome is productive. Create the space for them to voice their take on
your narrative, and youâll move the deal forward.  
â

### Frame Up the Decision Path

(**Minutes :20 - :25)**

At this point, the executive will be considering:

  1. Does this help develop or distract from my goals?
  2. Is it important enough that Iâd replace a current priority with this?
  3. If so, who from my team do I need to delegate this to?

**Executives think in terms of choices and tradeoffs, you see.**

If their goal is to âincrease revenue,â they can do that in a lot of
different ways. The higher level the goal, the more choices that exist:

Which means your competition isnât another vendor.

**Itâs the risk they prioritize an altogether different project over
yours.**

For example, say your product helpsÂ ramp new sales reps. By actively choosing
this path to new revenue, theyâre choosing **not** to invest more time and
budget into the other routes above.

Of course, not everything is a binary, either-or choice. But the point is
this:

**You need to understand if the executive believes the cost of the problem you
solve, and the payoff you can unlock,_is greater than_ the cost or potential
upside of all other priorities.**Â

To discover if youâre truly aligned on priorities, frame up a choice for
them:  
â

>  _How does our conversation compare to the other priorities your teamâs
> already focused on, like expanding revenue from current accounts?  
>  
>  Are there certain projects this discussion will need to take a backseat
> to?_

This phrasing _assumes_ there are higher priorities, and allows the executive
to correct you if itâs not the case.**â**  
â

### Confirm Owners & Outcomes

(**Minutes :25 - :30)**

At this stage, youâll want to confirm if your conversation met the
executiveâs desired outcome. Did you clearly map each minute to the goal
they care about?

**If so, the most likely outcome is an internal referral.**

That referral is worth its weight in gold. It brings priority with it. âDo
this, because it matters.â

The key here is to ensure you have a specific name to work with, not a general
action:

  * **Bad:** âWeâll just need to make sure you pass our security requirements.â
  * **Good:** âJon Clark is our VP of Info Security. I'll need him to send you our evaluation form.â  
â

### Work on a Team, Not an Island

(**Minutes :00 - :30)**

Throughout the meeting, you should be able to answer every question in a way
that creates **intrigue and respect** â but donât expect yourself to do
this alone.

Lean on your own team and champions along the way. Have your own executives in
the room, ready to talk about your narrative. Ask champions to share why they
believe in you.

Your job is to **facilitate the discussion** , not be the main voice in the
room.  
â

## Post-MeetingÂ Strategies that Sustain Momentum

Right after the meeting, youâll want to keep up [your deal's
momentum](https://www.fluint.io/post/measuring-deal-momentum-the-formula-for-
enterprise-sales) with these strategies.  
â

### 1/ Follow Up with a Forwardable Email

An exec-level meeting typically kicks off a new set of [internal
communications](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-map-b2b-decision-makers-
enterprise-account-maps-that-actually-help-win-deals) to the buying team. Help
shape those communications by writing up a forwardable email.

Thatâs an email sent through one person, to reach another. There's a
framework for these,[ here](https://www.fluint.io/resources/the-forward-
worthy-follow-up-guide).  
â

### 2/ Use No-Response-Needed Updates

Keep the executive posted on the latest progress â while minimizing the work
required from them â with updates that don't require a reply. You can
literally say:  
â

>  _< Executive >, weâre continuing to make good progress on X.  
>  
> We also have Y planned for next week, and will update you after.  
>  
> _**_No reply needed_** __**_here_** _â just keeping you in the loop._

Executives like to feel that theyâre in the know, and in control of whatâs
happening.

This type of emails create this sense, and [builds the
trust](https://www.fluint.io/post/trust-based-selling-how-to-manage-this-
hidden-pipeline-metric) that youâre moving the ball forward.

By the way, this isÂ a good question for the end of your meeting. âHow would
you like us to keep you updated?â  
â

### 3/ Build Your Championsâ Internal Reputation

Finally, remember that in this process, youâre stepping into someone
elseâs house. Youâre a short-term guest. But your champions will live with
the executive long after youâve left.

**So your main goal in all of this is to create more internal standing for
them.**

Youâll know youâve done your job if, after your meeting, your champion
shares they're grateful you were part of the conversation.

Just like youâd feel if you went to a wedding, and brought John Legend with
you to sing to the bride and groom. Amazing.
