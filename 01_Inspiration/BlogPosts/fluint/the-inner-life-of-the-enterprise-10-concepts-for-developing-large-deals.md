Whatâs the biggest difference between selling SMB and enterprise deals? Ask
someone whoâs never sold enterprise and theyâll say deal size. Six, seven-
figure contracts.

Ask someone who _has_ sold to the enterprise and youâll hear something
different. The sales cycle.

Whether youâre an AE accepting a promotion, or sales leadership moving your
focus up-market, closing larger deals can take far longer than youâd expect.

This can be frustrating, but thereâs often a lot happening behind the
scenes. Deeply understanding this [inner life of the
enterprise](/resources/the-inner-life-of-enterprise) will let you:

  1. Keep a high level of empathy for the champion youâre building.
  2. Troubleshoot whatâs actually going on when deals stall.
  3. Accelerate the sales cycle with valuable follow-ups.

Hereâs an insiderâs look at 10 corporate concepts you should know as you
develop larger deals.

## 1\. The Law of Large Numbers

A classic error when selling enterprise is focusing on your impact to revenue.
If you you can create $10M in new revenue, that sounds good, right? Can anyone
turn down $10M?

They can â and do all the time. $10M doesnât qualify as a rounding error
for someone like Procter & Gamble, who did $75B dollars in sales last year
($10M is 0.0001% of that).

On the flipside, project management software may sound pretty basic. Itâs
helpful, but not groundbreaking. But if youâre an energy company investing
$20**B** in capital projects each year, project management reducing waste by
1% creates $200M in value.

> **The Takeaway:** The Law of Large Numbers makes it difficult to have a
> meaningful impact on revenue, so donât over-index on this in your
> messaging.

## 2\. Meetings as Forcing Mechanisms

Meetings are a corporate ritual that takes some getting used to. Large
companies have a lot of meetings. A LOT of meetings. Thereâs a purpose to
this â itâs not always the meeting itself thatâs valuable. Itâs that
the meeting becomes a forcing mechanism.

Meetings are a version of corporate deadlines. Theyâre a way of forcing
feedback, decisions, or executing on certain tasks.

> **The Takeaway:** Remember that after an intro meeting, your counterpart
> will likely book an internal meeting to discuss next steps. Itâs a way of
> forcing feedback. Donât expect a second meeting with you until this ritual
> is complete â which relies on points #3 and #4 below.

## 3\. The Game of Calendar Tetris

Even if your first contact happens to be the decision maker (which is
unlikely), itâll cost them relational capital to unilaterally make your deal
happen. Which means theyâll always bring other colleagues into the picture
â lots of them. Each with their own schedule and priorities.

Enter the game of Calendar Tetris. This is where your contact tries to line up
a 30-minute call between 5 different people, with packed schedules, across
different time zones.

> **The Takeaway:** If youâre booking a follow-up and are given a date three
> weeks in the future, donât worry. This doesnât mean theyâre not
> interested. The most likely explanation is they simply couldnât find a
> time that was available sooner.

## 4\. The Art of Internal âLanguagingâ

Every enterprise speaks a different dialect of corporate. Itâs shaped by
executives talking about their goals and needs to business unit leaders, and
how those leaders relay this to their VPâs, and so on.

Using the right language inside a request makes getting buy-in easier. It taps
into a narrative that leadership one level up is already bought into. So,
employees learn to frame requests around key phrases and trigger words that
grab attention.

This practice, âlanguaging,â is typically done in the form of a memo,
deck, or emails that gives their boss something to reference when talking to
âhigher-upsâ in a closed-door meeting.

> **The Takeaway:** Pay attention to the exact words your buyers use. Mirror
> this in your [sales follow-upâs](https://www.fluint.io/post/your-new-
> sales-enablement-job-description). The point is to make it unbelievably easy
> to share about your solution more widely, without forcing your champion to
> re-write and translate your lingo into theirs.

## 5\. Non-Committal Feedback

You wonât always know where you are in the sales cycle. Your prospects
arenât ready to move forward, but they also havenât said no. Which means
you simply donât know where you stand.

Hereâs the thing. Itâs very likely that your champion doesnât know,
either. In some ways, corporate environments are the same as yours â we all
respond to immediate threats first, and push all else down our to-do list. For
example, if your teamâs hiring a new VP of Sales this week, software
probably isnât the first line on the sales team meeting agenda.

> **The Takeaway:** Make sure youâve built [a sharp problem
> statement](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-build-a-compelling-problem-
> statement-case-study) that canât be ignored. Combine this with your
> championâs ability to âlanguageâ your message, and when built into an
> internal meeting agenda (see #2), youâll begin to see movement on your
> deal again.

## 6\. Titles Matter, A Lot

Titles are a powerful tool. Itâs how corporate power is signaled. A Vice
President has more power than a Manager. Thatâs obvious. But the non-obvious
reason why titles matter is you should be cognizant of WHO pitches your idea.
Ideas are not independent of their messenger.

In large corporates, the perception of a new product varies based on who
champions it. An idea suggested by an analyst can be dismissed as
âoutlandish,â but introduced by an SVP as âvisionaryâ.

> **The Takeaway:** While a bottom-up sales approach has its place, one short
> email sent by a high-ranking employee in support of (or against) your deal
> can be the deciding factor. Cultivate support from decision-makers up and
> down the food chain.

## 7\. Mismatched Levels of Urgency

Straight up, large companies will _never_ have the same sense of urgency you
have. Corporate environments are highly-structured and operate in annual
planning cycles. Not the monthly, or even weekly, sprints of smaller
companies.

Whatâs more, your counterpartâs _personal_ financial situation is rarely
linked to your particular deal. So the importance of a sales meeting is
diluted to the enterprise. By contrast, you may only be working a handful of
large deals at any given time, so each one becomes immensely more valuable to
you.

> **The Takeaway:** Frame concerns about slow-downs in your deal around the
> personal benefit to your counterpart. For example:_  
>  
> âYou mentioned better data is part of your VPâs top goals, and sheâd
> love to see proof-of-concept results in Q4, which is right before annual
> reviews start.  
>  
>  If we can have IT share your data this week, youâd be able to showcase
> how youâre proactively moving your VPâs top goals forward in time for Q1
> reviews.â_

## 8\. The Stigma of Failure

Long-standing employees can be incredible allies. They can navigate your deal
through backchannels and closed-door conversations. They often have a higher
level of informal decision-making clout, too.

While a high-growth team may view failure as testing and scaling, corporate
employees recall one thing about deals that didnât work â it failed.
Failure is not well-tolerated in the enterprise, so long-time employees
internalize the art of avoiding failure.

> **The Takeaway:** Early in your discovery, dig deep into whatâs been tried
> in the past. If your company is even remotely similar to a previously-failed
> concept, spend extra time reassuring your counterpart how youâre
> different. It may be worth your time to create an âus vs. themâ chart.

## 9\. Approval Bottlenecks Are Real

Thereâs always a final decision-maker who needs to sign off on your deal.
That person is the one willing to pull the spend for your product from their
budget. Depending on what youâre selling, this person may be a senior
executive. Unfortunately, senior executives donât have much free time.

This leads to bottlenecks where everyone, including your champion, is waiting
on feedback from a single person. Not only for your deal, but tons of
projects. Which makes it easy for your deal to slip down the agenda,
especially when this decision maker lacks context from earlier meetings.

> **Takeaway:** Improve your odds of success by creating [internal
> communications your champion can
> forward](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-1-non-obvious-sales-tool-you-should-
> be-using) after each meeting, throughout the sales cycle. Encourage them to
> plant the seed early with, âFYI,â and âJust keeping you posted,â
> messages throughout the sales cycle.

## 10\. The Top-Down Scramble

Enterprise employees can spend considerable time fielding opportunities from
internal leaders. Some are helpful, many are distracting. For example, a board
member may read an article in the Wall Street Journal, forward it to their
executives, and an executive will forward it to their team to say, âWhat are
we doing about this?â

Answering that email can derail an entire day and delay any progress on other
projects. If youâre not directly tied to this newly-urgent priority,
thereâs a good chance youâll be out of mind for a few days.

> **Takeaway:** Make sure youâre on top of the latest news, comments, and
> statements coming from corporate leadership. Set up Google alerts, read
> 10-Kâs, and sign up for press releases from the companies youâre
> cultivating a deal with to know whatâs top-of-mind.
