I just spent nearly 10 hours reading internal emails and memos that were
leaked from big tech companies. They spanned from the early 90âs to the
present, and were written by execs inside companies like Facebook, Microsoft,
and Tesla.

They were published on sites like [The
Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348082/zuckerberg-facebook-house-
committee-emails-app-development-speed-copying-innovation), and this [goldmine
called techemails.com](http://techemails.com), which are _incredible_ gifts to
sellers who want to:

  1. Land larger and more strategic deals.
  2. Enable champions with a compelling narrative.
  3. Influence a buying team's internal communications.

If youâve read anything on this blog, you know I couldnât put these emails
down.

**Because I hold two, very strong opinions in life:**

  1. Chocolate with less than 80% cacao isnât âdarkâ chocolate.
  2. Enterprise Sales = Internal Communication.

Only the second is relevant here, but theyâre both things you should know.

So Iâll highlight the most interesting excerpts from all my reading in this
post, along with the top takeaways for enterprise sellers.  
â

## 1/ Challenge & Clarify, Donât Just Agree

Iâve never met a ânormalâ enterprise executive. Most have [a very
distinct style](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-avoid-screwing-up-executive-
level-sales-meetings#:~:text=Adapt%20to%20Their%20Quirks). Elon Musk is
Exhibit A, who strikes most people as abrasive.

When interacting with a unique and bold personality, most employees default to
option 3 in this email. Even if they (1)Â donât agree (2) or understand.
Itâs seen as [the safe route](https://www.fluint.io/post/the-inner-life-of-
the-enterprise-10-concepts-for-developing-large-
deals#:~:text=8.%20The%20Stigma%20of%20Failure).

Which means your job as an enterprise seller is to:

Otherwise, youâll never get a deal done.

Youâll continue to hear, âSo sorry for the hold up, weâve just been
really busy,â while teams keep their heads down and execute what their
executives say.

â

## 2/ Discover the Internal Trigger Phrase & Align with an Existing Priority

Hereâs some nuance to the first point: 95% of the time, youâll fail if you
challenge _what_ the executiveâs priority is. Instead, you should challengeÂ
_how_ theyâre going about it.

There are two parts to this practice:

  1. Discover the [unique, internal language](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-ask-better-questions-a-roadmap-for-more-powerful-discovery#:~:text=Identify%20Trigger%20Phrases%3A) the executive uses.
  2. Show that youâre aligned with [the priority theyâre already sold on](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-sell-priorities-not-problems-5-steps-to-shift-your-messaging).

Hereâs how this played out at Facebook. Tom Alison, Head of Facebook, wrote
up an internal memo to spread his primary narrative at the time: Shifting
Facebook into a âDiscovery Engine.â

**Look at the underlined sentences in the memo below (or**[**download a full,
line-by-line breakdown here**](http://www.fluint.io/resources/enterprise-
sales-lessons-inside-a-leaked-facebook-memo)**), and you'll see:**

  1. âThe Discovery Engineâ is a phrase Facebook employees mentally flag as âimportant.â  
â

  2. Alisonâs long-term strategy drives everyoneâs near-term priorities (keepingÂ reading for more on this). So if your champion shares a message that doesnât relate, theyâll be ignored.  
â

â

## 3/ Craft a Narrative With Your Champion & Connect it to an Existing
Narratives

Notice that the starting point for Alisonâs narrative is a **shift**. _â_

 _"Today we see a_** _shift_** _towards social media product serving as..."Â_
which is a massive change that needs a response in _"the current moment.â_

This is exactly why the Strategic Soundbite formula I've written about â a
condensed version of your [1-Page Business
Case](https://www.sellingwith.io/course-preview-1-page-business-case) â
starts with two elements:

  1. A significant change.
  2. The importance of acting now.

Next, notice where Alison says this phrase came from.

â**Itâs shared language created and used by the entire Meta leadership
team:**

Whatâs more, theÂ Discovery Engine narrative is part of an even larger
narrative. One thatâs backed by Zuckerberg, shared with investors, and built
on another shift:

The shift from Facebook to Meta.

Thatâs whyÂ [narratives are like
constellations](https://www.notion.so/9-Must-Read-Sales-Lessons-Inside-the-
Leaked-Internal-Emails-at-Tesla-Facebook-
Microsoft-3e6a2634e579472daae8ea181bd7de43). They gain traction by moving
alongside other narratives inside the company. Verge reporter Alex Heath
[described the link](https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/15/23168887/facebook-
discovery-engine-redesign-tiktok) this way:  
â

> While Instagram has already morphed to look more like TikTok with its focus
> on Reels, executives hope that a similar treatment to Facebook will reverse
> the appâs stagnant growthâ¦ but this time, the stakes are arguably
> higher.  
>  
> Investors are doubting Metaâs ability to navigate challenges to its ads
> business. And with its stock price already battered, the company needs to
> show it can grow if Zuckerberg wants to keep funding his metaverse vision.

If we jump to Metaâs
[Q3](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2022/q3/Meta-Q3-2022-Earnings-
Call-Transcript.pdf) and
[Q4](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/META-Q4-2022-Earnings-
Call-Transcript.pdf) 2022 earnings calls, we see this narrative being shared
over, and over again. **The phrase âdiscovery engineâ is mentioned at 13
different points:  
â**

##  
4/ Frame Problems to Gain Attention

As Alison continues, notice how he talks about the problems in the way of
their priorities.

Short-form video is a gap. Thatâs pretty straightforward. But notice [the
subtle framing](https://www.fluint.io/resource-content/the-enterprise-sales-
playbook#attributes-and-behaviors-of-a-
champion:~:text=Charles%20Muhlbauer.-,Framing%20the%20Problem,-How%20you%20and)
in the next section. He says deciding what content to show their users:

  1. Is _not_ a question of building a better ranking system.
  2. Is a matter of âevaluating billions of pieces of content.â

**Alison is pivoting the issue away from ranking, towards "evaluation," which
defines the solution space theyâre interested in.**

And notice how theyâre actively looking for partners across the business. In
other words, theyâre facing a
[multithreaded](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-multithread-navigate-
dysfunctional-buying-groups-in-enterprise-sales) problem. Which creates the
opening for a âbuild vs. buyâ conversation.

Often, the scales tip to buy instead of build when other teams donât have
the bandwidth to support another internal team.  
â

## 5/ Quantify Outcomes With a Specific, Exec-Level Metric

In the early days of Facebook, Zuckerberg was laser-focused on a single
metric: development speed. It was both [the problem and the
payoff](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-ask-better-questions-a-roadmap-for-
more-powerful-
discovery#:~:text=A%20Roadmap%20for%20Effective%20Questions%20During%20the%20Buyer%E2%80%99s%20Journey)
he was pushing his team on.

Because for him, this was what determined whether their strategy succeeded, or
failed.

The point? If your business case in the year 2008 didnât explicitly link
your project to increased development speed, it was probably ignored.  
â

â

## 6/ When an Exec Writes You a 4,200 Word Email, Nothing Else Matters

Just to hit this point of selling priorities home, look at the way Zuckerberg
concludes an insanely long email. (I pasted the whole thing into
[wordcounter.net](http://wordcounter.net) and found it was 4,262 words long
â 2-3X the average blog post, all written with his thumbs.)

## 7/ Cross-Team Communication is Challenging

Now, let me back up and show you the very first paragraph to that email:

**Zuck calls out a reality that blocks multithreaded projects _constantly:_**

  * New projects often fall âin betweenâ business units.
  * Different business units each hold different budgets & incentives.
  * Uniting multiple business units around a new direction is very hard.

**So hard that the CEO wrote up 4,200 words to get something moving.**

And thatâs exactly why, if youâre not using your account maps to [design
internal communications](https://www.fluint.io/post/how-to-map-b2b-decision-
makers-enterprise-account-maps-that-actually-help-win-deals), your deal is as
good as dead.  
â

## 8/ Sell the Approach Before the Product

Inside that same 4,200-word email, Zuck outlines 4 different ways to get their
Messenger Platform moving in the right direction. Hereâs him teeing up the
different approaches:

And him recapping all four after laying out the details:

Now, notice just how different each of these paths are. Theyâre all rolling
up to the same goal, but theyâre entirely different routes.

**This is a classic mistake enterprise sellers make.**

They hear a goal thatâs aligned to their product, like, âDrive more
revenue,â and they jump right into sharing how their product helps.

But they havenât addressed the higher-level choices and tradeoffs between
approaches. For example, here are all the different inputs to âdriving
revenue.â  
â

So first, sell the approach. Then, sell a product that enables that approach.

## 9/ Weâre All Human, Both Rational & Emotional

Thereâs an interesting duality in this email chain from Bill Gates.

He feels Microsoft is falling far behind in the music business, and emails his
execs with two very different ways of thinking:

  1. **Rational.** At the top of this image, and later on down the email chain (not shown), he asks for [scenarios](https://www.notion.so/9-Must-Read-Sales-Lessons-Inside-the-Leaked-Internal-Emails-at-Tesla-Facebook-Microsoft-3e6a2634e579472daae8ea181bd7de43). Structured ways of predicting the future.  
â

  2. **Emotional.** In the middle, his emotional side comes out. He shares his FOMO, which grows while seeing his friends walking around with iPods.

Here's how the email reads:

The takeaway? Weâre allÂ human. So when youâre building your message,
donât forget to:

Alright. That was a lot, so me let summarize. The jump from selling B2B, to
selling B2E, is less about the [activities that directly involve sales
reps](https://www.fluint.io/post/designing-a-sale-around-buying-behaviors-two-
shifts-that-win-deals) (demos, pitches, etc).

Instead, selling B2E is about influencing the internal debates and decisions
that happen behind closed doors â and determine the outcome of your deal.

Broken down into four major skillsets, selling B2E is about:

> [1] Writing compelling narratives, [2] with an army of champions, while [3]
> designing the flow of internal communications, [4] to influence a large
> number of contacts with conflicting opinions & priorities.
