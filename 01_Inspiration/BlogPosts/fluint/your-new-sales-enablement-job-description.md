"No way," was my first thought when IÂ read this stat from Gartner on B2BÂ
buying.Â

Now, well over 90% of B2B buying happens _without_ sales teams in the room,
and outside of a seller's direct control.

This one stat, and the reality of B2BÂ buying today that it points out, has
created a whole new world for B2B sellers.

## What makes or breaks B2B deals.

The stages in a sales team's pipeline are just a small fraction of a
prospectâs overall buying process. In fact, B2B buyers spend just
[5%](https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/insights/b2b-buying-journey) of their
time talking with an individual sales rep.

This isn't describing "product-led" sales, by the way. It's the reality for
complex, six-figure deals too.

**Which means the most critical moments that make or break a B2B deal happen
during a prospect's internal meetings â not sales meetings.**

This is how the typical deal plays out.

A prospect does their research, talks to other customers, and eventually,
decided they'll talk to a sales rep. That prospect will ideally become the
sales rep's "champion," and pitch the product's value to their team. Then, the
buying team debates their problem-product-fit behind closed doors, and repeat.

Along the way, sales reps donât have much, if any, face time with the true
decision maker(s).

â**Instead, the deal champion manages the seller's message. Not the sales
rep.**

The Fluint team interviewed 290 buyers to figure out _exactly_ how this
process works from the buyer's perspective.

When a champion messages a product's value to their team, they either:Â

  1. Wing their pitch. 
  2. âFrankensteinâ their own meeting materials by patching together snippets of decks, downloads, and demos.

Why? Because they said they wonât send sales templates or marketing
materials to their boss.

If it doesnât sound like them, or speak to their bossâ _exact_ goals, they
wonât risk their decider writing off a product they truly believe is the
answer to their problem.

In the case of an experiencedÂ B2B buyer, whoâs in serious pain without a
solution, theyâll select option #2. They'll invest theirÂ time into the sale
by crafting their own "enablement materials."

But if the buyer is less experienced or committed â and the sales rep
doesnât have an easy way to build custom materials they'll want to use to
guide their message â the deal has a far greater chance of falling apart.

## The rise of _Buyer_ Enablement.

Clearly, this is a problem. So whatâs the solution?

[Buyer Enablement.](https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/insights/buyer-
enablement)

Which, according to Gartner, is the process ofÂ making a buyerâs job as easy
as possible, by crafting specific content just for them âÂ right when they
need it. The outcome of this process is helping the decider make a confident,
low-regret purchase decision.

Sales Enablement tools make a seller's job easier. Sales reps can quickly
search for content, and see analytics on whatâs working. Itâs automation
and insight. But B2B buyers want these things, too, and no sales tech is built
for this.

As a result, each time prospects get a case study or proposal template that
doesn't reflect the conversation they had with a sales rep, they feel that
sales rep is saying:  
â

> Youâre not _that_ different from our other customers. This template should
> work.

> I donât need to _really_ listen. Just enough to know which use case to
> talk about.

> My notes donât need to be _that_ thorough. Just enough to edit my pre-
> built proposal.

**All of which requires the buyer to invest more of their time into the
deal.**

The buyers we interviewed explained how they sift through stacks of follow-up
links, listen to a Gong recording, find the two sentences in each document or
clip thatÂ are relevant, translate it into their internal lingo, cobble
together their own pitch material, lay it all out in a meeting, listen for
their teamâs concerns, troubleshoot....

You get the idea.

Buyers called this the "treasure hunt." However, sales reps who don't want to
send their prospects on a treasure hunt have a difficult choice to make.

The sales rep can either, (1)Â spend time crafting a custom asset their buyer
is confident enough to share â ensuring they shape their product's message;
or (2) use the easy, pre-built marketing templates they're given.

This is what costs today's sales team winnable deals. Enablement thatâs
overly focused on the seller's process, not the buyer's internal sales
process.

## Sales Enablement's new job description.

This is why Enablers are embracing a new paradigm. Theyâre both the Seller
_and Buyer_ Enablement team.

This shift in thinking has led to a new Sales Enablement job description, and
two parallel shifts along with it:

### Sellers donât sell solutions.

Itâs common for sellers to call their products, âsolutions.â Thatâs a
misnomer, though.

A solution is far more than a product. Itâs a product plus all the legwork
of crafting internal narratives, aligning divergent opinions, navigating the
corporate power hierarchy, planning an implementation, and so on. Most of
which is orchestrated by the buyer, not a sales rep.

This, packaged together, is a solution. (Youâve probably felt this if
you'veÂ ever pitched a piece of software to your own team.)

### Sales reps donât close deals. Buyers do.

Most sellers bristle at this idea. But if you've read this far, you probably
see it now. The enablement job description goes one level deeper, **beyond the
interactions of sellers and buyers, and into all the related, internal jobs
that buyers lead as they interact with their own team.**

This â creating and enabling champions for every deal in a sales pipeline
â is how sales teams are increasing the revenue they generate by tenfold.

When sales teams make this shift, they start to notice a few things:  
â

> Prospects canât wait to get a follow-up call on the books.

> Theyâre open to bringing their VP into their calls with them.

> Their forthcoming with concerns, and eager for input.

Why?

Because sales reps are no longer selling _to_ them. Their selling _with_ them,
by enabling their buyer __ to message the solution _they_ created.

Who better to help a buyer sell than a professional sales enabler?
