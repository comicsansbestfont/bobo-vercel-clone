##### **📜 DEEP DIVE**

Sales at an early-stage startup often feel like wandering in the dark with a
flashlight that barely works. You hear a lot of vague advice: “Just hustle,”
or “Go get ‘em!” But when you’re the founder or first salesperson trying to
land those critical first customers, what you need are tactics, not
motivational quotes.

I came across an interesting post shared by [Whitney
Sales](https://www.linkedin.com/in/whitneysales/), founder of ThoughtForge,
creator of The Sales Method, and one of the sharpest sales minds. She shared
three powerful sales frameworks that I believe every founder should know and
use.

So I’m sharing some key points, along with my thoughts on them:

**Why?** Because at this stage, you are the first customer.

According to Whitney, “The inception of any company is inevitably linked to
the challenge the founder first faced and addressed. This part of the
narrative is too often forgotten, and it’s key to connecting with a customer.”

Before you’ve got fancy logos and metrics, you’ve got your pain and your
reason for building the product. Use it.

**The Exercise:** Use this simple story-building template to craft a value-
based founder narrative:

> “[SUBJECT] [ONCE UPON A TIME], [SITUATION] [CUSTOMER PROBLEM]. [CUSTOMER]
> and realized [FEATURES OF PROBLEM]. [COST]. [SUBJECT] learned [IDEATION
> PROCESS]. As a result, [SOLUTION].”

This isn’t fluff. It’s how you relate, build trust, and show the human reason
behind your product.

Example: The TalentIQ founder started his first company and lost time and
money because a recruiter couldn’t send qualified candidates fast enough. He
saw the chaos of 50 tabs open across scattered data sources, and realised
recruiters lacked one clean source of truth. That pain led to the product.

You’ve already told this story to yourself, your early hires, and maybe
investors. Tell it again, but now to your customers.

**Why?** Because the founder’s story won’t always resonate with every buyer.

Whitney says, “If you only have one customer, extract the elements of their
use case that are most relatable to your prospect. A beta customer’s story can
be as valuable as a paid customer’s story.”

This is where your product’s _real-world_ value starts to come through. It
builds credibility and defuses objections.

**→ The Exercise:** Here’s Whitney’s customer story framework:

> “One of my clients, [CUSTOMER NAME], who is in the same [QUALIFICATION
> CRITERIA], was having the same problem. When I met with their [TITLE], they
> mentioned that [CUSTOMER PAIN POINT]. [DETAIL]. We implemented [FEATURE],
> and enabled them to [BENEFIT]. They saw [RESULT].”

📌 Example: A client had onboarding emails that weren’t working users dropped
off. Whitney’s team implemented behaviour-based emails that matched user
activity. The result? 63% more conversions. $4.2M in revenue unlocked.

Even if you have just one beta user, document their story. Get specific. Then
build a bank of these stories, segmented by company size, pain point,
industry, or tech stack.

**Why?** Because stories make people open up.

Early sales aren’t about pitching features. It’s about using founder and
customer stories to get a prospect to start talking. Whitney emphasises: “The
best sign a pitch is working? The customer starts asking you questions.”

**The Structure:** Here’s her proven sales conversation flow:

  1. **Start human (5–10 min):** Crack a joke. Be real. Show you’re not a robot.

  2. **Assert the agenda (2 min):** “I’d love to understand how you do ___ today, then share how we might help.”

  3. **Ask value-based questions (5–10 min):** Learn their pain points. What’s costing them time or money?

  4. **Tell a customer story (2–3 min):** Match their pain to a real use case. Share what worked.

  5. **Go deeper into ROI (5–10 min):** Tie their pain to your product’s benefits. Use their own words to frame the solution.

  6. **Decide or qualify (10+ min):** Ask about their budget, timeline, and who else needs to be involved (a.k.a. the classic BANT framework).

  7. **Lock next steps (5 min):** Don’t end the call on “we’ll be in touch.” Schedule the next meeting now.

If you’re an early-stage founder, your sales pitch is not your deck. Your real
pitch is your **founding story** and your **first customer win**.

Before you have a product that sells itself, you need stories that _speak_ for
it.

Whitney puts it best:

> “The first sale founders make with these stories is with themselves. Then
> they use them to hire, raise money, and attract beta users. Scale happens
> when these stories are passed on to your salespeople.”

If you’re starting from zero, these three frameworks will get you your first
few wins. And those first few wins? They’re what unlock everything else.

##### **📄 QUICK WIN**

I’ve seen posts claiming that VCs will ask you 250+ questions in a pitch
meeting. That’s nonsense. No investor is sitting there running through a
checklist that long. (If you know one, let me know—I’d love to meet them.)

Instead, here’s a list of key questions you’re likely to face. These are the
ones I used to ask while working with VC firms, and I’ve also gathered
insights from leading investors to curate this list.:

  * Tell me a bit about your background and your co-founder(s)’s background.

  * How do you all know each other?

  * Why is your team uniquely motivated to solve this problem?

  * Why did you pick your co-founder?

  * Who do you need to hire during the next 18 months to be successful?

  * When was the last time you had disagreed on a business issue? How did you resolve it?

  * Do the founders have the knowledge to build the technology or would they need outside help?

  * What does the cap table look like? (equity distribution across founders)

  * How are people solving this problem today?

  * Describe your solution to this problem.

  * What effort/timing is required to switch from a different solution to yours?

  * (For deeptech) What is unique about the tech? (Do you have any patents / IP / trademarks?)

  * What is your product roadmap for the next 6-12 months?

> _With the help of leading investors and founders, we’ve**prepared a detailed
> guide that shares important questions investors** will ask and how to answer
> them. You can check [it out here.](https://theventurecrew.gumroad.com/l/vc-
> questions-kit)_

  * Why now?

  * How big is this specific market?

  * What is your unfair advantage?

  * Who would you see as your key competitor at the moment? Why?

  * Who is your customer persona?

  * How much are people paying today? (range?)

  * How are you currently getting users / customers? (what customer acq channel(s)?)

  * How do you think you will get users / customers in the future?

  * How much does it cost you currently to get a user? And in which channel?

  * How much does your solution/product cost (COGs)?

  * Why do people buy / use your solution?

  * What is the sales cycle to-date?

  * How does the product team interact with current and potential customers? If so, how and how often?

  * What differentiates your solution from other alternatives?

  * Who are you more afraid of: Google or another startup?

  * What happens if a Google (or equiv) does this?

  * Who are the major players?

  * What is your moat?

  * When did you start the company?

  * How many customers do you have to date?

  * How much revenue have you generated to date?

  * Any notable customers?

  * What does retention or churn look like? (if you know)

  * What does engagement look like?

  * Any upsells?

  * When will your company break even in terms of profitability and cash flow?

  * How much have you raised to date?

  * How much are you looking to raise?

  * Where are you in your round?

  * What is your burn rate?

  * What is your top priority for the next 3-6 months?

  * What are your capital costs? (if capital intensive, like hardware/e-commerce)

  * Have you secured a lead investor for the round? If so, who and how much is the lead investing?

That’s it. You don’t need to prepare for 250+ questions. Some questions might
even feel frustrating, like “What if Google builds this?” or “How does this
become a billion-dollar company?” I know many founders get stuck on these and
struggle to answer them.

With the help of leading investors and founders, we’ve **prepared a detailed
guide that shares important questions investors** will ask and how to answer
them. You can check [it out here.](https://theventurecrew.gumroad.com/l/vc-
questions-kit)

Chris posted **[this
framework](https://x.com/frantzfries/status/1488195684121530370)** in January
of 2022.

Since then, he’s founded a [YC-backed startup](https://loops.so/) that makes
it incredibly simple and easy to send transactional emails and sequences for
any company, with a revenue growth chart that looks like this:

Here’s the framework:

  1. Pick a customer you enjoy talking to

  2. Talk to 15 of them to be sure you do (and can get in touch with them)

  3. Ask them to tell you a problem that’s more important than an 8 on a scale of 1-10

  4. If that problem is generalizable, make the smallest MVP you can (no code required, if possible)

  5. Ask the 15 people if they’d pay for what you built, or would pay if you prioritised a certain feature they ask for

  6. Repeat, with 50 new people. If the feature requests you’re getting are too varied, you may be solving the wrong problem.

Super practical and simple, but true! If you can’t find people to pay for your
product, you likely don’t have a product that can turn into a business. Click
