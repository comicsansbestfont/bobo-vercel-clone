As founders, we're always on this quest – where do those killer startup ideas
come from? Is it from solving our problems, fixing someone else's issues, or
just scouting for a hot market and then figuring out the problem later? Well,
surprise – it's none of the above. Yeah, you heard it right.

Now, check out the cool stories of Stripe, Airbnb, and Coinbase. They're not
just great startups; they share some key vibes that set them apart. It's not
just about building a killer product; it's about the unique journeys they
took, from crafting their product to scoring big from top-notch venture
capitalists. That's what makes them the real deal.

And the first thing that you find common between this startup is -

  1. **TIMING:**

Airbnb, Coinbase, and Stripe didn't have it easy when they started.  

There were **already big players in the game, kind of like the cool kids on
the block.** But what made these startups stand out was that they didn't
chicken out just because there were competitors.

See, the thing is, these founders didn't look at the existing products and
say, "Oh well, someone's already doing this. Let's find something else." No
way.

`They saw an opportunity to do it way, way better – like 10 times better. It's
like going from a flip phone to the latest smartphone – a whole different
level.`

Now, here's the funny part. A lot of wannabe founders, when they see a
competitor, get all scared and think, "Oh, they're already doing it. Let's not
bother." But these guys, they looked at the competition and said,

> **"We can do this way better. Let's go for it."**

And you know what? That's the secret sauce. Instead of giving up, they saw a
chance to make something amazing, something that would blow the existing stuff
out of the water. So, the next time someone tells you there's already a big
player in the game, just remember – that's not a roadblock; it's a challenge
to make something 10 times cooler. It's like turning competition into
inspiration.

  2. **IDEAS:**

So, these founders had these wild ideas, right? And pretty much everyone –
including some big-shot investors – thought these ideas were terrible. Why?
Either they seemed impossible to pull off or just sounded bad.

But here's the twist – the founders didn't give a second thought to all the
naysayers. Why? Because they were on a mission to make something 10 times
better than what was already out there. So, when the experts said, "This won't
work," the founders just shrugged and said, "Watch us make it awesome."

It's like turning doubt into a challenge. They knew they were onto something
big, and expert opinions weren't gonna stop them

  3. **MARKET:**

So, when the brains behind Stripe, Airbnb, and Coinbase first looked at their
opportunities, they thought, "Meh, it's kinda small." But here's the kicker –
these opportunities ended up being way, way bigger than they ever imagined.
Like, surprise!

Now, let's dive into Stripe and Airbnb, and see how these genius ideas came to
life.

So, before Airbnb became the big thing, there were already some similar
platforms like **[VRBO](https://www.vrbo.com/)
**and**[Couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/)**[
](https://www.couchsurfing.com/)around.

VRBO was cool for vacation rentals, but it had this annoying issue – paying
for your stay was like a whole ordeal. You had to figure out cash, checks, or
wire transfers. Not the smoothest process. Plus, they charged hosts to list
their places, which wasn't making it easy for people to join in.

Then there was Couchsurfing, the freebie in the group. You could crash at
someone's place for free. Sounds good, right? Well, not for everyone. Staying
in a stranger's house, especially if they were there, didn't sit well with
everyone. Couchsurfing had this whole vibe of being non-commercial, so making
money from it wasn't the cool thing to do.

> Both of these exisitng startup in the same industry had the major issue and
> that’s where Airbnb entre to make this experince 10X better……

**Now, enter Joe and Nate, the brains behind Airbnb.** They stumbled upon this
idea when they needed rent money and rented out part of their place during a
conference. Lightbulb moment!

They realized there was a way to help others make money from their spaces.

**They noticed two big problems with the existing players.**

  * First, the payment system was a mess. Airbnb fixed that by making payments easy and secure. No more awkward cash exchanges. 

  * Second, VRBO was charging hosts upfront, which didn't make sense to Airbnb. They decided not to charge hosts to list, making it way more attractive for people to jump on board.

**The timing** was on Airbnb's side too. They kicked off when folks were
looking for extra cash after the economy took a hit. And get this, the
founders were solving their problem – not being able to pay rent. Real-life
stuff.

But, convincing people wasn't a walk in the park. Staying at someone's house,
especially with them there, didn't sound like a vacation to many. And were
they making money from a community-driven thing? Nah, not cool, said the
general vibe.

Looking back, Airbnb's success is like a mix of challenging the norm, fixing
actual problems, and creating a platform that just worked better. They didn't
follow the usual "get big first, make money later" advice, and well, it paid
off. Airbnb became this global disruptor in how we think about finding a place
to crash.

> And if you look carefully, you will find that - Airbnb matches with the
> above three themes - timing, idea & market.

So, before Stripe came along, dealing with **online payments was a bit of a
headache,** Like - setting up credit card payments for companies back in the
early 2000s, and it was like applying for a mortgage. Lots of paperwork,
faxing, and personal guarantees. Not a walk in the park, to say the least.

The cool thing about Stripe was that it solved a real problem. Stripe’s
Founders saw their friends in Y Combinator struggling with other payment
systems, and they decided to make something better. And boy, did they!

**What set Stripe apart was how it treated developers.**

> Most payment systems were built for business people, not the folks writing
> the code. But Stripe went all out to make their documentation and website
> super developer-friendly.
>
> It was like the Apple of payment processing. They even made it the most
> expensive option in the market, and people still wanted it.

But of course, not everyone was on board initially. People were sceptical.  
`Why - Two teenagers, 19 years old wanting to dive into the banking space?
That sounded like a crazy idea. And there were questions about regulations and
getting a deal with a big bank like Wells Fargo. Plus, PayPal was already a
big player, making it seem like a crowded market.`

But here's the thing – all these founders, whether it's Airbnb, Stripe, or
others, had real problems they were solving. They had experience and insights
that most people didn't get. And yeah, most folks thought they were a bit
nuts. But they executed. They built products that handled tons of money, and
they did it well.

So, the takeaway? Don't be scared of existing products in the market.

`“If people hate it and you know how to make it better, go for it. Don't worry
if the so-called experts tell you it's a dumb idea. And be careful about
sizing up your market too early – sometimes you discover new possibilities
once you've got a killer product out there.”`

In a nutshell, just because everyone else thinks you're crazy doesn't mean you
can't build something amazing.
