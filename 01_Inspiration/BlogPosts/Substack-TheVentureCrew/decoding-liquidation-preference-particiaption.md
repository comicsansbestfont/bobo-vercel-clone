Imagine this scenario: You're buzzing with excitement over your brilliant
startup idea, and a venture capitalist shows interest in funding your venture.
But hold on a second, there's a crucial hurdle to overcome: term sheets.
Suddenly, terms like "1x participation" and "non-participation" start popping
up, and you're left scratching your head, wondering, "Do I really need to
understand all this legal jargon as a founder?"

Fear not, because I've got your back! Let's demystify these terms together and
make sure you're well-equipped to navigate the complex world of startup
financing. So grab a cup of coffee, get cosy, and let's get started!

Let’s deep dive into it:

I hope you are aware of what is a term sheet. - If not then in the simplest
word.

**A term sheet** is a non-binding legal agreement (non-disclosure and non-
sharing) between the founders & investors that shows the investor’s interest
in that startup.

Understanding clauses like 1x liquidation participation or non-participation
is crucial for both investors and founders in order to protect and maintain
the value of their investments during a liquidation event. It is essential for
founders to grasp these concepts and make informed decisions about whether a
1X or 2X liquidation preference is the right choice for their circumstances.

**Let’s understand this with a simple example:**

Consider a startup that got the term sheets from PQR Fund including the
**investment aspects as follows:**

  * $ Invested: $4M

  * Pre-Money Valuation: $8M

  * Post-Money Valuation: $12M

  * Employee Stock Option Pool: 15%

  * Liquidation Preference: Let’s take two cases:

I hope you are aware of the terms like Pre-money, Post money valuation or
option pool. If not then I must say to read our previous writeup on this -[

If you see the last row, you will find that term called Liquidation
Preference. So let’s understand this term first.

**Liquidation Preference** :

It is the priority that investors have in receiving proceeds (money) from the
sale or liquidation of a company. In layman's terms, it means that the
investors with a liquidation preference have the first right to get their
money back before any proceeds are distributed to other shareholders.

For example,

if an investor has a liquidation preference of 1x, they would get their
initial investment back before any proceeds are distributed to other
shareholders. If the investor has a liquidation preference of 2x, they would
get twice their initial investment before any proceeds are distributed to
other shareholders. Here In this term sheet, you can see VC fund PQR have 1X
liquidation preference. It means in case of liquidation of the company, funds
PQR first received the initial invested amount back before any proceeds are
distributed to other shareholders.

There are two other terms also involved in it - **participation and non-
participation liquidation preference.** Let’s understand both the terms,
participation, and non-participation liquidation preference.

**Non-Participation Liquidation Preference:**

Upon liquidation, non-participating investors have the choice of receiving
their funds in one of two ways: either based on a 1X preference or according
to their stake in the company. Investors typically compare the potential
returns from each option and select the one that would provide the most
benefit for them.

**Ex -** Suppose for fund PQR - if in liquidation (sale) of a company valued
at $10 M. let’s calculate the return for investors from both ways:

1\. 1X liquidation means investors get 1X of the investment amount - so $4M OR

2\. Based on the percentage of stake - 33% * $10M (Valuation) - $3.3M.

So after calculation, it’s clear that option 1 - 1X liquidation preference
gives more return to the investor hence he will choose the 1X option and get a
return of $4M. And the rest amount of $6M ($10M - $4M) will distribute to
other shareholders.

**Participation Liquidation Preference:**

During the liquidation of a company, investors with a participation
liquidation preference are entitled to receive their funds through both
methods - a 1X preference and a percentage of their stake in the company.

**Ex -**

Let’s take the same example as above if the fund PQR took the 1X participation
liquidation preference then the calculation would be the same - but investors
will get a return from both ways so 1X liquidation preference = $4M and Based
on percentage stake = $3.3M. So total return for the investor = $4M + $3.3M =
$7.3M and the rest amount of $2.7 ($10M - $7M) will be distributed to another
stakeholder.

As a founder, if your company is liquidated and there is a participation
liquidation preference in place, your returns will be minimal. Therefore, it's
advantageous to have a 1X non-participation liquidation preference in the term
sheet. Additionally, most venture funds typically use a 1X non-participation
liquidation preference as it aligns the interests of investors and other
stakeholders in the event of company liquidation.

I hope this write-up will help you to understand these clauses.

If you had invested in every YC startup at Demo Day since the accelerator’s
founding in 2005, you would have made a whopping 176% average annual return
net of dilution² (practically speaking this would be impossible, but more on
that later).

This is far greater than other asset classes and even top-decile venture
capital funds:

Below are overall seed-stage YC startup investment returns broken down by
year. Even ‘modest’ years like 2010–2011 produced 70–80% average annual
returns, and the stronger years like 2012–2013 saw 300%+ average annual
returns………. Read More here
