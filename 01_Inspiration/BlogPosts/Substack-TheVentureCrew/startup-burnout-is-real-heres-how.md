##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

I spoke with a founder recently. He’s been building full-time for over two
years. And he’s not the kind of person who complains easily.

But this time, he opened up.

> “I feel like I’m stuck in something I can’t leave. I’m exhausted. I still
> believe in the idea, but I don’t feel anything anymore. Just pressure.”

He wasn’t looking for advice. He just needed someone to get it.

And I did. Because I’ve been there.  
Most founders have. We just don’t say it out loud.

On the outside, startup life looks like product launches, fundraising wins,
and hiring announcements. Scroll through your feed and you’ll see a highlight
reel.

But behind the scenes? It’s often a very different story.

  * The launch underperforms

  * The team doesn’t fully buy in

  * The burn rate keeps creeping up

  * The motivation starts slipping

It builds slowly, but then it hits hard: That quiet feeling of isolation. Of
wondering if you're the only one struggling.

The deeper truth is this: If you’re building something truly new, you will
feel misunderstood.

You’re the one carrying the vision. You’re asking others to see a future that
doesn’t exist yet. And when no one fully gets it, you start to question your
judgment.

> Am I wrong?  
> Is this just a bad idea?  
> Should I quit?

This is what makes the middle of the journey so hard. Being early feels
exactly like being wrong until it finally clicks.

When the pressure builds, the first thing to go is your physical health.

It seems like a small thing, just a few habits slipping. But over time, this
turns into a fog that affects everything: your thinking, your decisions, your
ability to lead.

If you’re feeling that way, don’t overthink it. Start small. Take 30 minutes
today.

Eat a real meal without multitasking. Go for a walk. Sit in silence. That’s
not “taking a break.” That’s maintenance. It’s how you stay in the game.

One of the most valuable habits I’ve seen from high-performing founders is
strategic distance.

[Tara Viswanathan (founder of Rupa Health)
](https://www.taraviswanathan.com/fun)takes solo retreats every quarter. No
team, no partner, no notifications. Just space to think.

You don’t need to disappear to a cabin in the woods. But you do need to build
in space to zoom out.

A long weekend. A solo day each month. Even a few screen-free hours on Sunday
to reset.

If you never step back, you’ll always feel like the house is on fire, even if
it isn’t.

We’re finally in a world where coaching and therapy aren’t seen as weaknesses.
They’re tools.

The best founders I know invest in support. Not because they’re fragile.
Because they know this journey is brutal without a sounding board.

Whether it’s a coach, a therapist, or a mentor, it changes everything when you
have someone helping you zoom out, reflect, and grow.

And if money is tight, don’t overcomplicate it. Reach out to other founders
who’ve been through it. You’d be surprised how many are willing to talk if
you’re honest about what you’re struggling with.

There’s no version of building something real that doesn’t come with moments
of despair. The difference between those who make it and those who burn out
isn’t grit, it’s support.

So here’s what I’ll leave you with:

  * Check in on your basics: food, sleep, movement

  * Build space to think - quarterly, monthly, weekly

  * Get help sooner rather than later, even if it’s just a conversation

  * Talk to founders who’ve seen the same darkness

Because if you’re here, if you’re still trying, if the fire hasn’t gone out
completely—  
You’re not done.

And the world still needs what you’re building.

Also, burnout sometimes happens due to a very overlooked reason we shared in
our [previous
articles..](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/165325043/hours-later-what-
does-startup-life-look-like)

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

We’re living through a historic technology shift with AI.

But here’s the catch: while product-building has changed dramatically in the
last two years, distribution hasn’t kept up.

[Brian Balfour](https://substack.com/@brianbalfour) recently published one of
the most important essays I’ve read, and I couldn’t stop thinking about it. So
I’m summarising key ideas here, plus adding a few takeaways and warnings for
founders, builders, and operators.

We’re building AI-powered products in 2025 using the same playbooks from 2015.

SEO traffic is collapsing. Social platforms are walled gardens. Discovery is
dying.

The old growth channels (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn) are no longer reliable.
And the new ones haven’t fully emerged. That’s the dangerous gap we’re sitting
in.

> “AI is actively destroying the distribution channels we’ve relied on for
> decades.”

Every major platform follows the same 3-step cycle:

  1. **Identify the moat** : What makes the platform defensible? (For Facebook, it was the social graph. For Google, it was search data. For Apple, it was the app ecosystem.)

  2. **Open the gates** : Make it easy for developers/creators to build on top. Offer viral mechanics, generous APIs, and monetisation splits.

  3. **Close and monetise** : Once escape velocity is reached, the platform tightens control. Growth tools disappear. Fees rise. Organic reach vanishes.

This isn’t theory. It’s a repeating, predictable pattern:

  * Apple let anyone build on the App Store, then absorbed top apps and enforced a 30% cut

  * Google gave free SEO traffic, then filled SERPs with ads and scraped answers

If you're building on a platform and not preparing for this cycle, you're
walking straight into a trap.

Brian believes the next distribution platform will be ChatGPT (OpenAI) and
that we’re already in Step 2: Opening the gates.

Here’s why:

  * ChatGPT has 700M+ users and is showing elite retention

  * OpenAI is actively launching connectors (HubSpot, Box, GitHub)

  * They're hiring a dedicated Agent Platform team

  * They’re laying the foundation to become the new interface, not just an app, but an OS layer for work

> Their moat? Context + memory.

Not just answering prompts, but remembering who you are, what you’ve done,
what you want next.

Once you feed your data, workflows, and habits into their ecosystem… switching
becomes extremely hard.

> Past platform shifts played out slowly:

With AI? The timeline might be even shorter. Developers are already racing to
integrate. Users are building muscle memory. The window to get early
advantages is now.

If you’re late, you’ll still have to integrate, but you’ll miss the upside and
enter just in time for the platform taxes.

  1. **Integrate early, but not blindly**  
Ride the wave to acquire users, get visibility, and stay competitive. But
don’t hand over your entire value chain.

  2. **Build a moat inside your product**  
Own your data. Build community. Create differentiation that’s not tied to
OpenAI’s API.

  3. **Assume the gate will close**  
Have a plan for when distribution gets taxed, APIs get limited, or ChatGPT
launches a feature that replaces your app.

  4. **Diversify your channels**  
Use the distribution while it lasts, but don't depend on it. Keep building
your brand, email list, or independent acquisition loops.

> “Use ChatGPT’s distribution, but don’t let ChatGPT become your product.”

If you’re building SaaS, AI tools, or content products, this shift affects you
now, whether you realise it or not.

The winners of the AI era won’t just build with better tech. They’ll see the
distribution shift coming and position themselves before the herd arrives.

Every platform looks friendly in the beginning. That’s by design.

The smartest founders? They partner with the platform, profit during the
“open” phase, and prepare for the “closed” one.

Don’t be caught off guard. The next great distribution shift isn’t coming.
It’s here.

**[Patrick Campbell](https://x.com/Patticus)** sold his startup, Profitwell,
for $200 million last year — and it was entirely bootstrapped.

Since then, he’s started sharing a lot of primary research he’s commissioned
into topics where there isn’t a lot of ground truth data on. Most recently, he
shared his **[competitive research
playbook](https://patticus.com/2023/12/16/competitive-research-playbook/)**
and shared this framework — the market command matrix:

The y-axis represents how much of a competitor’s resources they’re piling into
your market, and the x-axis represents how aware customers in your market are
of the competitor.

The big text in each quadrant is what you should do in response. While the
placements on the matrix aren’t exact (for example, a “big VC bet” could have
dramatically more or less mindshare depending on what stage they’re in),
Patrick’s recommendations are good.

Note that he only recommends you take action against the two quadrants on the
right — the competitors who your target and/or existing customers are likely
to be aware of.

Another note: “all-out attack” may mean exploring partnerships when you both
have leverage in different parts of the market — it doesn’t mean burning all
your money on paid ads.

He also includes free playbooks on how to handle competitors in each quadrant
— the **[full article](https://patticus.com/2023/12/16/competitive-research-
playbook/)** is worth a read.

A cap table, or capitalisation table, is a chart typically used by startups to
show ownership stakes in the business. It lists your company's securities
(i.e., stock, options, warrants, etc.), how much investors paid for them, and
each investor's percentage of ownership in the company.

You can obtain a stockholder ledger from your lawyer, which lists all
stockholders and shows how many shares or options they hold. However, I don't
consider this document a comprehensive cap table. In this, I am sharing a cap
table template that is used by various leading VC firms’ partners.

> **[Click here to download the Excel
> sheet.](https://theventurecrew.gumroad.com/l/captabletemplate)**

The basic outlines of this cap table are:

  1. It shows all the major stockholders of the company listed on the left side. It also shows the major option holders and buckets of option holders

  2. It shows all of the classes of stock and how much was paid for them across the top of the columns

  3. For each investor, you show how much of each class was bought and how many shares of that class they own as a result

  4. You total up the cost and shares and then calculate ownerships on a fully diluted basis (which means you include the options, whether issued or non-issued or vested or non-vested).

I like this presentation for its simplicity and because it shows the
progression of financing activity. It also has the benefit of showing how much
each investor has put in on a cost basis, which many cap tables leave out.

If you want to make a cap table for your company, feel free to replicate this
format. If you have angel investors, put them in the angel section. I would
include the largest ones and bucket all the rest into “other angels.”
