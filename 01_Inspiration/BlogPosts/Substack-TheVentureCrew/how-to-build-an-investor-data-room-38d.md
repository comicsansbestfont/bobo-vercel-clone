##### **INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU**

Spotted something interesting this week that got me digging deeper. **[Lettuce
Grow](https://www.lettucegrow.com/invest) is changing how we get fresh
produce**—starting with home hydroponics and now making its way to grocery
aisles.

**Why I’m paying attention:**

The founding team is stacked—Jacob Pechenik (MIT grad with a major NYSE exit),
Greg Campbell (built 4 successful ventures), and Zooey Deschanel (who sold
HelloGiggles to Time Inc.).

**The numbers? They’re crushing it:**

  * **$10M+ revenue** , ranked #11 on Inc. 5000 in California

  * **11x LTV/CAC ratio**(fellow investors, you know how rare that is)

  * **And here’s the big news** : They just **landed a[major retail deal with Costco](https://insider.fitt.co/press-release/lettuce-grow-announces-new-product-and-retail-distribution-with-costco-wholesale/)**, bringing their fresh, hydroponic produce into one of the most trusted retailers in the U.S. It’s a huge validation of their market potential and signals that demand for better, fresher food is only growing.

**With Collaborative Fund and top VCs already in** , they’re now **raising
$7.9M** on **[WeFunder](https://www.lettucegrow.com/invest)** to fuel
expansion.

##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

As a first-time founder, you might find yourself in this situation - excited
about a positive response from a potential investor, but suddenly faced with
an unfamiliar term: 'data room.'

A data room is essentially a secure, organized collection of documents that
provides detailed information about your company. It's a tool for due
diligence, allowing potential investors to examine your business's financials,
operations, and potential in depth.

But before diving into how to build an investor data room, let me share an
important insight: Don't send all your data to investors too early in the
process.

Just because investors request data room access doesn't necessarily mean
you're making progress. Many founders make the mistake of sending all their
information at once (even before the first investor call) and end up getting
ghosted by VCs. The best way to avoid this is to create a two-stage data room
approach:

  1. A pre-term sheet data room

  2. A post-term sheet data room

This structured approach helps protect your sensitive information while
maintaining investor engagement throughout the fundraising process.

**Stage 1: Pre-Term Sheet**

At this point, investors typically have limited information about the company,
relying mainly on the pitch deck, website, and publicly available data. They
request access to a preliminary data room to perform a quick spot check and
gather material for internal discussions with their partners.

This Stage 1 data room helps investors validate their initial interest and
prepare for more in-depth conversations about the potential investment.

Here’s a list of the 5 sections and types of content you’ll want to include in
your stage 1 data room:

  1. **Business Summary / Company Overview**

  2. **Traction / Product Market Fit**

  3. **Financials**

  * Purpose: provide a financial overview of your business from the day you started to the present day with forward-facing projections. If you don’t have a financial model built, I highly recommend you check out Sturppy. Sturppy’s is used by 4,000+ startups and allows founders to build an investor-ready financial model without being an expert on finance or financial modelling.

  * Docs to include:

    * P&L / Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cashflow Statement, Financial Projections 1-3 years in the future

  4. **Team & Roles**

  5. **Cap Table**

After receiving and negotiating a term sheet, you enter Stage 2 of the data
room process.

**Stage 2: Post-Term Sheet**

This stage is crucial for streamlining due diligence before any final
agreements are signed. It's wise to create a separate, more detailed data room
for this phase, rather than just expanding your Stage 1 room. This approach
gives you better control and flexibility, especially when dealing with
multiple investors at different stages.

Here’s a list of additional sections and content you’ll want to include:

  1. **Entity Formation Documents**

  * Purpose: These documents are mostly needed by the legal team and are the set of documents used to certify your business’s good standings. These docs are going to fluctuate based on where your business is incorporated and the type of business entity you’ve chosen. If you’re a startup in the US, 9/10 if you’re raising venture, you’re going to be established as a Delaware C-Corp

  * Docs to include:

    * Shareholder certificate documents

    * Local/state/federal business licenses/letters of good standing

    * Articles of incorporation

    * Bylaws, Tax ID number, Operating agreement between founders, Shareholder meeting minutes/board minutes, Annual meeting notes/minutes

  2. **Customer & Partner Contracts**

  3. **Proof of Intellectual Property**

  * Purpose: If your company has IP and that was part of the pitch, you’re going to have to show proof of that IP. This includes patents, trademarks, copyrights, design

  * Docs to include:

  4. **Full cap table documents**

  5. **Tax Filings**

  * Purpose: Proof that your company is in good standing with the IRS

  * Docs to include: Tax History, Previous filings, Previous audit statements and any third-party financial evaluations

  6. **Information on Any Outstanding Litigation**

Just remember - unless you’ve received a term sheet and you’re asked to share
(and you will be asked if you’ve received a term sheet and decide to move
forward) don’t share (Stage 2 data room data) it until it’s requested.

Also, many founders ask about what solution to use to create and store all
this data. Let me address that:

If you're a founder on a budget, Google Drive works perfectly fine as your
data room. There's no need to spend money on fancy solutions. Some of you
might worry about privacy, security, analytics, and tracking - but honestly,
at your early stage, these aren't critical concerns.

Google Drive is secure enough, costs nothing, and most importantly - investors
are already familiar with it. Save your money for things that actually move
your business forward. That’s it.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

There is an article titled 'The Durability Formula' by NFX. I feel many
founders overlook building companies that last. I'm sharing some key points
and my thoughts on this.

Remember most of the real value in tech companies isn't created in those
exciting early days but in the long run. The catch? You can only capture the
value in the long term if you **design for durability from day one**.

**What’s the Secret of Lasting Companies?**

Think of durability like a recipe with five key ingredients:

  * Network Effects (making your product more valuable as more people use it)

  * Economies of Scale (getting stronger as you get bigger)

  * Brand Power (building emotional connections)

  * Embedding (becoming essential to your customers' operations)

  * Intellectual Property (protecting your innovations)

Let's break these down and explore the questions you should be asking
yourself.

**Network Effects: Making Your Product Sticky**

Remember this golden rule: a "multiplayer game" beats a "single-player game"
every time. Think about it - isn't Facebook more valuable because all your
friends are there? Here are some key things to consider:

  1. Does your product get better when more people join?

  2. Have you solved the chicken-and-egg problem of getting those first users?

  3. Where's your "white-hot centre" - that core group of super-active users?

Watch out for potential pitfalls too. Can users easily switch between your
platform and competitors (like drivers do with Uber and Lyft)? Are users
trying to bypass your platform for direct deals (like happens with freelance
marketplaces)?

**Economies of Scale: The Beauty of Getting Bigger**

This is where math becomes your friend. As you grow:

  * Can you negotiate better deals with suppliers?

  * Do your costs per unit go down?

  * Can you outspend competitors on marketing because your economics work better?

Think Amazon - they can offer lower prices while still making money, which
makes it really hard for others to compete.

**Brand: The Emotional Moat**

Here's where human psychology comes into play. Apple users don't just buy
phones - they buy into an identity. Ask yourself:

  * Do people feel like they're part of something special using your product?

  * Would users feel like they're "downgrading" if they switched to a competitor?

  * Does your brand carry social proof that makes decisions easier for customers?

**Embedding: Making Yourself Indispensable**

This is particularly powerful for B2B companies. Once Workday or Salesforce is
integrated into a company's operations, good luck trying to rip it out.
Consider:

  * How painful would it be for customers to switch away from you?

  * Are you becoming their "system of record"?

  * How many of your products are they using?

**Intellectual Property: Your Technical Moat**

While software patents might not be super effective (things move too fast),
this becomes crucial in bio and tech. If you're in these spaces, you need to
think about:

**Building for the Long Haul**

Here's what it all comes down to the real value in tech companies comes from
compound growth over many years. But you can only capture that value if you
build durability into your company's DNA from the start.

Think of it like building a house - you need to lay a solid foundation before
you can add all the fancy stuff. The most successful founders I know spend
serious time thinking about these durability factors early on. They know that
as their companies grow, these factors make them increasingly difficult to
compete with.

Remember: You're not just building for today or next year - you're building
something that should get stronger over time. Start with durability in mind,
and you'll be setting yourself up to capture the kind of compound value growth
that creates truly exceptional companies.

Jeff Bezos says he hires people only if they pass 3 separate bars:

  1. Can the person do exceptional things?

  2. Does he admire them?

  3. Will the person raise the effectiveness of the team?

You can get answers to all three of these questions in a single, 30-minute
interview if you ask the right questions.

I would highly recommend reading - Smart Management by Jochen Reb to learn
more about it.
