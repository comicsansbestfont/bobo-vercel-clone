##### **START WITH**

Two and a half years into AI’s consumer wave, the market is stabilising. The
latest Top 100 Gen AI Consumer Apps list shows where usage is shifting:

  1. **The big platforms are consolidating**

     * ChatGPT still leads, but Google’s Gemini has surged to #2 (12% of ChatGPT’s web traffic, nearly half its MAUs on mobile).

     * Google added four new entries (AI Studio in the top 10, NotebookLM #13, Google Labs #39).

     * Grok (X) is growing fast: #4 on web and 20M+ MAUs on mobile after launching Grok 4 and companion avatars in July.

     * Meta AI debuted but is lagging, #46 on web, missed the mobile cut.

  2. **China’s ecosystem is strong**

     * Quark (#9), Doubao (#12, #4 on mobile), and Kimi (#17) dominate locally due to restricted access to ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude.

     * Chinese-developed apps now make up nearly half of the mobile list, especially in video and photo editing (e.g., Meitu with 5 entries).

  3. **Vibe coding is sticking**

     * Lovable (#22) and Replit entered the list, showing real user retention and spend.

     * Supabase and other “vibe coding stack” tools are riding this wave.

  4. **The “All Stars” are emerging**

     * Fourteen companies have appeared on every list, including ChatGPT, Midjourney, Perplexity, Character AI, Leonardo, Photoroom, HuggingFace, and Eleven Labs.

     * Half run on their own models, the rest leverage APIs or open source.

The AI consumer market is no longer a free-for-all. General assistants
(ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Claude), regional champions (China-first products),
and niche verticals (image/video editing, vibe coding) are defining the
landscape.

If you’re building in AI, the lesson is clear: find your durable edge, global
reach, regional moat, or specialised use case and scale from there. ([Read
full report here](https://a16z.com/100-gen-ai-apps-5/))

Most founders hit a point where shipping velocity slows, and the default
reaction is: hire more engineers. However, adding headcount also introduces
complexity — including culture shifts, coordination overhead, and increased
burn. An alternative that’s starting to look real: treat AI agents like junior
hires.

That’s exactly what Linktree did. Going into 2025 planning, they [faced
pressure to scale their engineering
team](https://www.firstround.com/ai/linktree) beyond 100 people. Instead, they
froze hiring at ~190 total employees and leaned hard into AI. Here’s what they
found:

  * **Where it delivered value**

    * **Repetitive engineering tasks:** Their AI agent (Devin) now contributes ~2 PRs per engineer per week, especially for dependency upgrades, bug fixes, and debugging.

    * **Faster prototyping:** Engineers use it to quickly spike new features or test fixes — not production-ready, but good for grounding discussions and estimation.

    * **Security scanning:** AI helps detect and patch vulnerabilities across repos, saving the small security team countless hours.

  * **Where it failed**

    * **Complex or messy systems:** Inconsistent schemas and tech debt confused the AI, making outputs worse. The team had to clean up naming conventions, event schemas, and APIs first.

    * **Over-ambitious projects:** Attempts to auto-generate pixel-perfect pages failed. AI is powerful, but not a replacement for high-craft work.

  * **The real cost**  
AI adoption didn’t “just happen.” The CTO tracked usage dashboards, nudged
laggards, reframed AI as a junior teammate to manage, and created social
pressure (AI demo meetings, “Wins and Whoopsies” Slack channel).

**The takeaway:** Hiring an AI agent _is worth it_ — but only if you:

  1. Point it at repetitive, low-leverage work.

  2. Clean your tech debt so it has good patterns to learn from.

  3. Actively drive adoption across the team.

For Linktree, the payoff was clear: more launches without more hires, 25x
cheaper moderation, and customer support scaling 80% with AI. For most
startups, that’s a strong case to at least experiment with “hiring” an AI
teammate. ([Read detailed report
here](https://www.firstround.com/ai/linktree))

Despite a slower dealmaking environment, valuations in Europe are trending up.
According to [PitchBook’s Q2 2025
report](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/bigger-checks-higher-price-tags-
vc-valuations-rise-in-europe):

  * **Median pre-money hit a decade high:** €8.6M (~$10M), up 15.6% YoY. Series E+ companies led the surge, with median valuations reaching €1.2B as investors backed profitable, stable-revenue businesses.

  * **AI is driving the bump:** Early-stage AI startups are seeing the biggest jumps. Median valuations in AI rose ~19% to €8.7M, signalling investor appetite for “AI-native” companies rather than incumbents bolting on AI features.

  * **Bigger checks, fewer down rounds:** Median deal size rose 23% to €2.5M. Only 15% of European deals were down rounds in H1 (one of the lowest shares this decade), though Q2 showed some uptick.

**Examples to note:**

  * Cato Networks hit $4.8B with a $359M Series G.

  * TravelPerk nearly doubled to $2.7B with a $200M raise.

  * Synthesia ($2.1B Series D) and Tines ($1.1B Series C) cemented AI/no-code momentum.

If you’re early-stage, especially in AI or fintech, valuations are trending
higher, but investor selectivity is too. Big checks are flowing, but mainly
into clear category leaders or tech with defensibility. If you’re raising,
expect deeper scrutiny but better pricing if you stand out.

##### **SOMETHING MORE**

Most founders confuse surveys with validation. But real validation only
happens when people pay. Tom’s [simple 3-step framework
](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tombilyeu_the-fastest-way-to-go-broke-build-
something-activity-7365005097946238977-61-a/)helps you test demand before
investing time or money:

  1. **Write a 1-sentence offer**

     * Who it’s for

     * The promised outcome

     * Timeframe

     * Price

     * Guarantee (removes risk)

Example: “I help burned-out executives build $10K/month side businesses in 90
days or you don’t pay.”

  2. **Make it buyable within 24 hours**

     * Simple checkout (Stripe link works)

     * 10-line DM script → pitch outcome, price, guarantee, and share the link

  3. **Test with real money**

     * Send 25–50 targeted DMs + 1 public post

     * Track clicks, replies, and payments

**Rule:** If people pay → build. If they don’t → change one thing and retest.

Every successful consumer business grows the same way: like a racecar. To move
fast, you need the right engine, fuel, boosts, and lubrication. Here’s how the
[reforge breaks](https://www.reforge.com/blog/racecar-growth-framework) it
down:

  1. **Growth engine**

The self-sustaining loop that drives most of your growth. There are four core
engines: performance marketing, virality, content, and sales.

Breakout companies usually rely heavily on just one engine at the start—Zoom
grew through virality and sales, Airbnb through virality and performance
marketing, Salesforce through sales. Over time, the biggest companies layer on
multiple engines.

  2. **Turbo boosts**

Short-term accelerators like PR, brand campaigns, and events. They can
kickstart growth, but don’t sustain it. Many early startups lean on these to
spark traction, but the mistake is mistaking a one-off boost for a repeatable
engine.

  3. **Lubricants**

Optimisations that make your growth engine run more efficiently—conversion
improvements, smoother onboarding, and better retention. Retention is the most
important because if customers keep coming back, every other investment in
growth compounds.

  4. **Fuel**

What your engine needs to run. Paid engines need capital to fund ads or sales
teams. Content engines need a steady flow of new content. Viral engines need
users who invite more users. Without the right fuel, even the best engine
won’t run.

So identify your primary growth engine early, commit resources to it, and use
boosts, lubricants, and fuel to make it faster and more durable. Most growth
mistakes happen when teams optimise too early, confuse one-off boosts for
engines, or fail to align everyone around the same model.

A landing page isn’t just design — it’s a sales machine. Mark [breaks
down](https://x.com/MarkKnd/status/1861735434969120885) the must-have elements
that turn visitors into paying users:

  1. **Hero section** → Call out the core problem + short subheadline with solution + clear CTA (demo/signup).

  2. **Benefits section** → Highlight 3 key benefits with icons or visuals for quick comprehension.

  3. **Target audience & use cases** → Show who it’s for and how they use it (avatars + 1–2 lines each).

  4. **Social proof** → Testimonials, logos, or metrics to build instant trust.

  5. **Pricing** → Keep it transparent with differences highlighted + obvious CTA on each plan.

  6. **Tools & integrations** → Display logos of platforms you work with (the bigger the partner, the stronger the trust).

  7. **FAQ** → Answer 3–5 real objections directly, not fluff.

A good SaaS landing page is structured storytelling → problem, solution,
proof, price, and trust.

Apple’s App Store was the last big platform shift. LLMs are the next ones —
and they require new principles for building. [Lenny’s
newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/why-your-ai-product-needs-a-
different) recently highlighted the **Continuous Calibration / Continuous
Development (CC/CD) framework** , which replaces “production readiness” with
an ongoing loop of agency vs control.

How it works:

  1. **Development side**

     * Scope capabilities by levels of agency (suggest → resolve).

     * Build a minimal app with logging, human overrides, and guardrails.

     * Design evals tied to your chosen metrics.

  2. **Calibration side**

     * Launch to a small group of users.

     * Run evals, watch user behaviour, and identify errors.

     * Fix, then cycle back into development.

**I** nstead of chasing a finished product, treat LLM apps as a continuous
6-stage loop of building → testing → fixing. That’s how you reduce
unpredictability and build user trust.

Micro-SaaS = a focused SaaS product with pointy features for a very specific
customer. Pat [studied
dozens](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18sH0AV_s0vR_kbFGhWLCkgua6xcMwqCM9qU1UmjZbN4/edit?tab=t.0)
of case studies and found common patterns behind the winners:

  1. **Ride trends or shifts**

     * Growing trend → e.g. waitlist software (ReferralHero, $18K MRR).

     * Missed opportunity → Amazon FBA tools (Gorilla ROI, $40K MRR).

     * Change in the world → rise of personal brands → Tweet Hunter ($220K MRR & acquired).

  2. **Build on large platforms**

     * Shopify (2M merchants), Amazon FBA (1.5M sellers), Twitter (100M+ businesses).

     * Example: WideBundle, a Shopify plugin for product bundling, $55K MRR.

  3. **Pointy solutions**

     * Do one thing extremely well → not an all-in-one.

     * Example: Testimonial → embed video testimonials, $83K MRR.

  4. **Serve a narrow customer base**

     * CyberLeads: only digital agencies targeting VC-backed startups ($40K MRR).

     * Gorilla ROI: not all FBA sellers, only spreadsheet/data-heavy ones.

  5. **Solve painful business problems**

$1M micro-SaaS ideas aren’t random — they win because they’re simple, built on
big platforms, serve specific customers, and solve money/time problems. Start
small, ship fast, and let the pointy feature lead you to growth.
