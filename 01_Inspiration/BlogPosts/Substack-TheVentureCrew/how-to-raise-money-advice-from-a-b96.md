##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

The probability of success for a high-growth company is predicated on your
ability to raise capital. As a leader, you will never achieve your maximum
entrepreneurial potential without being able to raise capital quickly and
successfully.

Capital is the lifeblood of any high-growth company. It has to be treated as a
key priority. It can never be outsourced or downgraded to a second priority.

[Brett Adcock](https://x.com/adcock_brett), **the founder and CEO of Figure
AI,** secured $70 million in its Series A funding round in 2023. Also his
previous ventures, Adcock has successfully raised significant capital: Vettery
was acquired for $110 million, Archer Aviation went public with a valuation of
$2.7 billion and raised over $1 billion.

He shared the framework for founders to raise capital. So read along -

“Remember - Investors are looking for certain traits. Without these, you have
little chance of raising a single dollar. Let's talk about how you can use the
formula to build a repeatable process for raising capital.

**Fundraising Formula:**

You need to maximise the number of shots on goal in fundraising. Aim to get as
many meeting attempts with investors as possible. The above formula for
capital raising is a combination of -

  1. The number of qualified investors you are targeting, combined with

  2. The company's idea & overall branding.

**The first step in the fundraising process is defining success**.

The ultimate goal is to raise capital successfully. If you work backwards from
there, getting to a lead investor's[ "term
sheet"](https://theventurecrew.gumroad.com/l/termsheetguide) is the next clear
milestone. And if you work backwards once more, the goal is to maximise the
number of unique investor meetings.

The Fundraising Formula is a way to compute how to maximise the number of
qualified investor meetings. Fundraising is about talking to 200 investors and
finding the 1 person who will take a bet on you. I've always experienced low
conversion rates in these efforts - it's never been easy for me to raise
capital. And that's quite normal.

**Here is the sensitivity to each part of the formula:**

  1. **Qualified investors** : You want to drive this number as high as possible. I speak to so many founders who are "waiting for referrals". This inevitably means this number is too low. You want to identify every possible investor on the planet, or else your equation will point to low odds of success.

  2. **Outreach:** This is your outreach process to investors. I gauge this as a percentage conversion rate. This will be really sensitive to the way you are reaching out (referral vs. cold email) and the messaging associated with the reach-out process (e.g. subject and body of a cold email). There is an art to this. The percentage conversion rate can greatly increase if you treat it as a recursive project to get better.

  3. **Idea:** This is the company's idea, and it's fixed. There is very little you can do besides pivot your company to a new idea. The idea will instantly either A) resonate or B) turn off investors based on their industry focus or their internal thesis of the market/industry.

  4. **Branding:** This is how well-branded or attractive your company is at first glance. You have a limited time to impress an investor enough for them to commit to a meeting. There are many ways to drive this up, including a nice investor deck. But ultimately, that's a small lever, so don't stress too much over this.

  5. **Investor Meetings:** This is the output of all your hard work. The goal is to drive up the number of qualified investor meetings as high as possible. You want to do 50-200 of these meetings. The more qualified investor meetings, the higher your odds of raising capital.

**Building the Fundraising Machine:**

I believe in building and executing on a highly structured "machine" for
fundraising processes. This machine is something you can wash, rinse, and
repeat. This should be similar to how you would run a sales or marketing team.

I track this process in a Google sheet, similar to how you track items in a
CRM. Let's break down the key elements of the formula so you can go out and
execute it yourself.

**Key Elements of a Fundraising Machine:**

  1. **Qualified List of Investors:** This is a list of investors who are tailored specifically to your company. Start with investment groups that match well with your company sector. Research to find an investment partner who covers your specific industry and maturity. Ideally, you have found 100% of every investor on the planet that you think could give you a term sheet.

  2. **Outreach Process:** Reach out to investors to set up a meeting. Try to get as many referrals as possible, then move to outbound for the rest.

  3. **Pitching:** Your first interaction with the investor includes them previewing the deck. Optimise the conversion rate from the first meeting to the term sheet.

  4. **Term Sheet:** Receiving a term sheet is the ultimate goal for the first leg of capital raising. Negotiate quickly and fairly to get the lead investor signed up.

**The entire process from start to finish will take at least 3 months**.

Spend 30 days preparing the investor deck, data room, mapping out investors,
and your cold email template.

The next 30-60 days are for investor outreach and meetings. Once you have a
term sheet, it generally takes <10 days to negotiate and sign, and you usually
close in 30 days.

**Additional Capital Raising Insights:**

  1. **Show metrics and customers** that can potentially correlate to long-term success for early investors to understand your product's potential.

  2. Understand **VC mandates** and match them to your industry to avoid spinning your wheels.

  3. **Showcase your "Championship Team"** \- there's no way you're building a great product without a #1 team.

  4. Aim for **80% of investor pitches** to come from outbound processes (cold calls or emails) and 20% from inbound processes (referrals).

  5. **Build a well-branded investor deck** as it's often the first impression investors have.

  6. **Recognise that interested investors move quickly**. If they're not hurrying, it's likely a sign you don't have a deal.

  7. Focus on **finding a "lead" investor** who can give you a term sheet and lead your round.

  8. Balance fundraising time with product development, as fundraising can be distracting for founders.

Remember, fundraising is a competitive process. Once the round is complete,
put your attention back to the product and get building.

I suggest setting up a quarterly "nurture" sequence to keep investors
updated.”

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

If your AI product isn’t seeing adoption, the issue might not be the tech; it
might be how confident users feel using it.

Most teams building AI products obsess over model accuracy. They test
precision, tune parameters, and improve performance. But after watching dozens
of launches and failures, product leaders like [Assaf
Elovic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/assafe/) (Head of AI at Monday)
[realised](https://medium.com/@assafelovic/the-hidden-metric-that-determines-
ai-product-success-799a98fd57aa) something strange:

> Some AI products with mediocre models gain traction fast. Others with great
> accuracy completely flop.

So what’s going on?

The answer lies in a concept called **CAIR - Confidence in AI Results**. It’s
a simple but powerful idea: People don’t adopt what they don’t trust.

And trust isn't just emotional, it's designable, measurable, and improvable.
CAIR gives teams a framework for doing exactly that.

**What is CAIR?**

At its core, CAIR is a score that reflects how confident a user feels in the
AI's output.

> The formula is: CAIR = Value ÷ (Risk × Correction Effort)

Here’s what each variable means:

  * **Value** : How helpful the AI is when it works.

  * **Risk** : What goes wrong if it makes a mistake?

  * **Correction** : How much effort does it take to fix a bad result?

> If an AI tool saves you time and is easy to undo if it fails, CAIR is high.
>
> If a mistake has big consequences and is hard to fix, CAIR drops fast.

This metric explains why even good AI gets ignored and how to fix that.

**Example: Why Cursor’s AI coding tool took off**

Cursor, the AI-powered code editor, became a favourite among developers. But
coding is risky; what if the AI writes buggy code?

Let’s break it down:

  * **Risk** : Low — the AI runs in a local editor, far from production.

  * **Correction** : Low — devs can delete or overwrite code instantly.

  * **Value** : High — saves hours on repetitive coding tasks.

**Result: High CAIR -** Developers trust it. They feel in control. They adopt
it.

Now, imagine Cursor's auto-deployed code to production servers. The Risk jumps
to High, even if Correction stays manageable.

**New CAIR = Much lower -** Adoption would likely suffer, even with the same
model accuracy.

**What about AI tools like Monday.com?**

Monday AI can automate workflows instantly. That’s powerful, but also risky.
What if it triggers the wrong action across a business-critical board?

  * **Risk** : Medium — real data, real impact.

  * **Correction** : Medium — complex to undo across systems.

  * **Value** : High — major time savings.

**CAIR: Moderate.**

Here’s the insight: Adding a preview screen could change everything. If users
see what the AI will do before it’s deployed, the **Risk** drops from Medium
to Low.

**Result: Higher CAIR → More adoption.**

This shows how product design, not just model tuning, can dramatically
increase AI success.

Some fields, like **finance and healthcare** , have built-in limitations:

Take tax software, for example.

But [TurboTax](https://turbotax.intuit.com/) uses a human-in-the-loop system.
The AI suggests optimisations. A human approves. Confidence rises.

Same with [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/) and healthcare
diagnostics: AI does pattern recognition, humans stay in charge of math and
decisions.

Designing around limitations beats waiting for perfect models. So, how to
improve CAIT ( Confidence in AI Results)

Here are 5 quick ways to boost your AI product’s CAIR, without changing the
model:

  * **Strategic human-in-the-loop** : Add human checks only at key decision points to prevent major errors without slowing things down.

  * **Reversibility** : Make every AI action easy to undo to reduce anxiety and build trust.

  * **Consequence isolation** : Let users test AI safely with drafts, previews, or sandboxes before going live.

  * **Transparency** : Explain why the AI decided so that users can trust, verify, and fix when needed.

  * **Control gradients** : Start with low-risk features and gradually offer more power as user confidence grows.

**Why this matters for product builders**

Here’s the mindset shift:

> Instead of asking, “Is the AI good enough?”, start asking, “Do users feel
> confident enough to use it?”

Because a well-designed, medium-accuracy AI can outperform a high-accuracy
system with poor UX.

Your product’s success doesn’t hinge on a 99% model. It hinges on:

And most importantly: How confident the user feels hitting that first button.

As a first-time founder, you might find yourself in a similar situation -
excited about a positive response from a potential investor, but suddenly
faced with an unfamiliar term: "data room."

A data room is essentially a secure, organised collection of documents that
provides detailed information about your company. It's a tool for due
diligence, allowing potential investors to dive deep into your business's
financials, operations, and potential.

In early-stage venture deals, data rooms play a crucial role at **two distinct
stages of the investment process.**

**Stage 1: Pre-Term Sheet**

At this point, investors typically have limited information about the company,
relying mainly on the pitch deck, website, and publicly available data. They
request access to a preliminary data room to perform a quick spot check and
gather material for internal discussions with their partners.

This Stage 1 data room helps investors validate their initial interest.

Here’s a list of the 5 sections and types of content you’ll want to include in
your stage 1 data room:

  1. **Business Summary / Company Overview**

  2. **Traction / Product Market Fit**

  3. **Financials**

  4. **Team & Roles**

  5. **Cap Table**

**Stage 2: Post-Term Sheet**

After receiving and negotiating a term sheet, you enter Stage 2 of the data
room process. This stage is crucial for streamlining due diligence before any
final agreements are signed.

It's wise to create a separate, more detailed data room for this phase, rather
than just expanding your Stage 1 room.

This approach gives you better control and flexibility, especially when
dealing with multiple investors at different stages.

Here’s a list of additional sections and content you’ll want to include:

  1. **Entity Formation Documents**

  2. **Customer & Partner Contracts**

  3. **Proof of Intellectual Property**

  * Purpose: If your company has IP and that was part of the pitch, you’re going to have to show proof of that IP. This includes patents, trademarks, copyright, and design

  * Docs to include:

  4. **Full cap table documents**

  5. **Tax Filings**

  * Purpose: Proof that your company is in good standing with the IRS

  * Docs to include: Tax History, Previous filings, Previous audit statements and any third-party financial evaluations

  6. **Information on Any Outstanding Litigation**

Also, we have created a detailed guide and included all relevant templates
that you need for your data room. All these curated with the help of startups
attorneys, VCs. You can access it here:
