After reading this title you might be thinking it’s clickbait, right? VCs do
care about Life time value (LTV) / Customer Acquition Cost (CAC)? OR CAC <
LTV. Actually they don’t care about this ratio. What! Why? Let’s deep dive
into this.

A business is an engine that attracts customers, delivers something of value
to them, and then extracts that value in the form of profits. That’s what a
business is. Thus it logically follows that _the cost of attracting a new
customer needs to be less than the value we can extract from that customer._
If it costs us $15 in advertising to get a customer, and we can only make $7
from them then Houston, we have a problem. But if it costs $15 to get them,
and then once they are a customer they make a bunch of repeat purchases that
yield $75 in profit, then we are happy. Ultimately every venture of every kind
has to have a Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) that is less than the Lifetime
Value (LTV) of a customer. It’s a simple, self-evident concept.

`Yet it’s a leading cause of startup death.`

A high percentage of startups die because their cost of getting customers
turns out to be higher than they can make from them. Partly this is just
because we’re all optimists — we all think our startup is so awesome that
people will flock to become customers and they will remain customers forever.
But eventually, that optimism fades as we realize that marketing is expensive
and no customer stays forever. The immutable laws of economics set in, and at
some point, many startup founders find that their LTV/CAC ratio is slowly
draining their bank account.

> To paraphrase [Ernest Hemingway,](https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-
> hemingway-gradually-suddenly-zeitgeist/) Startups go broke two ways:
> gradually, and then suddenly.

`Investors tend to obsess over the LTV/CAC ratio.`

Obviously, investors care about your LTV/CAC ratio because it’s the essence of
a successful business. But it’s also a proxy for the potential ROI of their
investment. If you have proof that you can spend $1 on customer acquisition
activities and get $5 in value back (an LTV/CAC ratio of 5.0), investors will
want to shovel as much money as possible into that engine. Most of the VCs
look for ‘just-add-money opportunity.’ Having a business with an LTV/CAC ratio
of over 5.0 looks like a “just-add-money opportunity” to investors.

`But it’s a blunt tool that is better if sharpened.`

Let’s say that during the quarter we spent $10,000 on sales and marketing and
got 1,000 new customers — a CAC of $10. But probably some of those customers
came through word-of-mouth, some came as referrals, some came from our PR
efforts, and some came from paid advertising. So we had a blended CAC of $10,
but that doesn’t tell us anything about the relative effectiveness of each of
our different customer acquisition efforts. Which leads me to the next point:

`Not all customers are created equal.`

With every business I’ve ever run, I’ve realized at some point that 80% of our
profits were coming from 20% of our customers. It’s amazing how this tends to
be true with almost all businesses. So if we look at the LTV (Lifetime Value)
of our entire universe of customers, we’ll probably see that 20% of them have
a much higher individual LTV than the rest. Wouldn’t we want to focus our CAC
efforts on getting more of the high-LTV customers? Yes, we would.

> Therefore, [cohorts matter.](https://www.appcues.com/blog/cohort-analysis)

The two points above would indicate we really want to track the LTV/CAC ratio
by customer cohort. For example, what’s the ratio of customers acquired
through Facebook advertising vs those acquired through Google advertising?
Knowing that would tell us a lot about how we should allocate advertising
dollars. What’s the LTV/CAC ratio for customers acquired through our referral
program? Knowing that would tell us how much we can afford to offer in a
referral fee. Knowing your company’s blended LTV/CAC tells you the health of
the overall engine, but it doesn’t tell you how to optimize the engine’s
performance for the next quarter. Tracking customer cohorts tells you that.

**Also, velocity matters.**

> `But do you know? - most of the VC don’t care about the LTV/CAC ratio, what
> they cares about is the velocity with which invested CAC comes back in the
> form of LTV. `

They Generally used CACD than CAC — the D is for “doubled”. CACD answers the
question, “If we spend $12 in customer acquisition activities, how long does
it take for us to get $24 back?” As an investor, he wants to see a business
with a CACD of less than eight months. This formula gets to the heart of an
inherent flaw in the LTV/CAC ratio: it doesn’t include a time factor. A
business with an LTV/CAC ratio over 5.0 might seem good at first, but if you
have to service a customer for 10 years before you make back the money you
spent getting him, then it doesn’t seem so good, right?

_**Velocity matters.**_ So think about how you can measure CACD for your
business. Putting $12 somewhere where it returns with a high velocity will
accelerate your engine of growth.

That’s it! So, from now it’s not LTV or CAC it’s LTV & CACD.

Recently I came across an article on “How can founder maximize their chance of
getting funded” by [Henrik Wetter Sanchez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrik-
wetter-sanchez/), Partner at Playfair Capital. It’s one of the goldmine
articles I read that include more practical approaches. So sharing a summary
and key points that I think you can follow to secure the funding:

_Source:[Medium Article Page](https://medium.com/playfair-capital-blog/ama-
series-hacking-the-vc-process-or-how-to-maximise-your-chance-of-getting-
funded-dc5eaee35603)_

The first important thing in this is to **secure a call with the investor**.
LinkedIn is your secret weapon. You can use it to find investors that match
your startup like a missing puzzle piece. And here’s the trick – personalized
messages. Forget those generic emails! Craft each message with care,
mentioning their past investments and why your startup aligns with their
vision. It's like making a tailored suit – fits perfectly!

Events are like treasure troves of opportunities. Attend as many as you can.
You never know which connection might lead to your pot of gold. And angel
investors? They're not just funding sources; they are your backstage pass to
the VC world. They not only invest but also introduce you to the big players.
Priceless, right?

Now, let’s talk **about those nerve-racking calls.** Picture it like a heart-
to-heart chat. Your story? It's your magic spell. Paint a vivid picture of
your startup’s future, and sprinkle it with real achievements. Investors love
a good story backed up by solid proof.

And here’s the secret handshake: speak their language. VCs have their own
lingo, and if you talk the talk, they’ll know you mean business. Understand
their processes, from the first hello to the final handshake. Knowledge is
power, my friend.

But ah, the red flags! VCs dream big, so when you talk numbers, think
galaxies, not ponds. And when you pitch, be clear and crisp. No rambling –
think elevator pitch, not a novel. And honesty? It’s your best policy. If
you’re honest from the get-go, trust me, it goes a long way.

Now, the million-dollar question: what if you face rejection? It stings, but
here’s the thing – it’s not always about you or your idea. Sometimes, it’s
just not the right fit, like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Brush
it off, learn from it, and keep moving forward.
