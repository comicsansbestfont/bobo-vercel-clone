##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

Top Founders know that fundraising is a critical skill that’s much harder than
meets the eye. But what’s rarely discussed is “**Fundraising is a learned
skill**.” And VCs almost always have the upper hand because they deal with it
all day, every day.

In reality, knowing what to expect from VCs – the negotiation dynamics
Founders are likely to encounter – is half the battle.

Before you start talking with VCs, take the time to learn how to detect and
manage these little-known fundraising dynamics. Let’s dig in. ( We are sharing
this in a more conversational format….)

  1. **The Portfolio Trap**

**VC:** "I'd like you to meet with one of our portfolio companies in your
space. They can provide valuable insights, and we'd appreciate their
perspective on your venture."

This request often puts founders in a tricky position. Sharing your plans with
a potential competitor can be risky, and the existing portfolio company has
little incentive to endorse your startup. They may tell the VC they're
planning to expand into your area, making it challenging for the investor to
back you. While VCs might have good intentions, this practice can sometimes
backfire or be used to gather intelligence for their existing investments.

**Founder’s Reply:** If the suggested company is too close to your business,
politely decline:

"I appreciate the offer and value your network. However, given the significant
overlap between our business and this portfolio company, I'm not comfortable
sharing our strategic plans. Perhaps we could meet with other industry experts
who aren't directly in our space?"

If the portfolio company isn't a direct competitor, consider accepting:

"Thank you for the introduction. I'd be happy to meet with them. It would be
valuable to hear about their experience working with your firm and get their
industry insights."

Remember, your goal is to protect your business interests while maintaining a
positive relationship with the potential investor. If you do meet, use it as
an opportunity to learn about the VC's support and working style from an
existing portfolio founder's perspective.

  2. **The Valuation Conversation**

**VC:** "What valuation are you looking for in this round?" or "What's your
target price for the company?"

This question is a common tactic used by VCs to gauge your expectations and
potentially anchor negotiations at a lower point. While it's a legitimate
inquiry, it can be a pitfall for founders who, in an attempt to appear
reasonable, might suggest a valuation below their company's true worth.
Remember, any figure you mention could become the ceiling, not the floor, for
further discussion.

**Founder’s Reply:** Unless you're dealing with a priced extension round or a
convertible note with predetermined terms, it's wise to defer to market
dynamics. A tactful response might be:

"We're open to letting the market determine our valuation. We're more focused
on finding the right partners who can add value beyond just capital."

If you've had a previous funding round, you can provide context without
committing to a specific number:

"Our last round valued the company at $X million post-money. Since then, we've
achieved significant milestones, including [brief mention of key metrics or
achievements]. We believe these developments have substantially increased our
value, but we're eager to hear the market's perspective."

This approach demonstrates confidence in your company's progress while leaving
room for negotiation and avoiding the trap of undervaluing your startup
prematurely.

  3. **Turn Into Home Run**

**VC:** "Based on our analysis, we'd like to offer you $X million at a
valuation of $Y million."

This initial offer might seem disappointingly low. It's a common strategy in
VC negotiations, often serving as a starting point rather than a final stance.
Inexperienced founders sometimes react emotionally, potentially derailing a
deal that could have been salvaged with the right approach.

**Founder’s Reply:** The key is to remain composed and professional. A
strategic response might look like this:

"Thank you for your offer. We appreciate your interest in our company. While
this valuation is considerably below our expectations, we'd like to take some
time to review it in detail. We'll get back to you soon with our thoughts."

This response acknowledges the offer without accepting or rejecting it
outright. It buys you time to explore other options and potentially leverage
them.

If you receive more attractive offers later, you can circle back:

"We've had some time to consider your offer and explore the market. We've
received interest at significantly higher valuations that better align with
our growth trajectory and potential. We value our relationship and wanted to
allow you to revisit your offer if you're interested. If not, we completely
understand and hope to stay in touch for future opportunities."

This approach keeps the door open while signalling that you have other
options. It gives the VC a chance to improve its offer without burning
bridges. Remember, maintaining positive relationships in the VC world can be
beneficial for future funding rounds or networking opportunities.

  4. **Deflect the Friendly Lowball**

**VC:** After a warm, engaging meeting filled with enthusiasm and positive
feedback, the VC follows up with a surprisingly low offer. This unexpected
contrast between their friendly demeanour and the underwhelming valuation can
catch founders off guard.

This scenario often leads founders to doubt their judgment or feel pressured
to accept a subpar offer due to the perceived rapport. It's a subtle tactic
that leverages the positive connection established during the meeting.

**Founder’s Reply:** The key is to maintain your composure and separate your
emotions from the business decision at hand. A balanced response might look
like this:

"Thank you for the offer. We truly enjoyed our meeting and appreciate your
enthusiasm for our vision. However, the proposed valuation is significantly
lower than what we believe reflects our company's current value and potential.
We'd like to take some time to carefully consider this offer in the context of
our market research and growth projections. We'll get back to you soon with
our thoughts on how we might bridge this gap."

If the VC doesn't adjust their offer, you can follow up with:

"We've given your offer careful consideration. While we greatly value the
potential of working together, we feel that this valuation doesn't align with
our company's trajectory and the current market. We're open to further
discussion if there's room for adjustment. If not, we hope to keep the door
open for future opportunities as our company grows."

This approach maintains a positive relationship while firmly asserting your
company's value. It leaves room for negotiation without committing to an
undervalued deal. Remember, a good partnership should be mutually beneficial,
balancing enthusiasm with fair terms.

  5. **Focus on Pre-Money Valuation**

**VC:** "We're looking at investing $2M at an $8M post-money valuation."

VCs often frame discussions in post-money terms, which can lead to confusion
and potentially reduced founder ownership if the round size changes.

**Founder’s Reply:** "Thank you for the offer. To ensure we're on the same
page, let's discuss this in terms of pre-money valuation. Based on your
proposal, we're looking at a $6M pre-money valuation. Is that correct? We
prefer to focus on pre-money valuation as our fundraising target may adjust."

  6. **ESOP Negotiations**

**VC:** "We'd like to see a 20% ESOP allocation before the round."

VCs often push for large ESOP pools to reduce their future dilution. They may
request excessive allocations, sometimes up to 20% or more, which can
significantly impact founder ownership.

**Founder’s Reply:** "We've analyzed our hiring needs until the next funding
round. Based on our projections, a 10% post-round ESOP pool should suffice.
This includes 2% for a key hire we've identified and 5% for additional team
members over the next 18 months. This aligns with market standards for seed
rounds and ensures we have enough to attract top talent without over-diluting
existing shareholders. We're open to discussing specific concerns you may have
about our hiring plan."

  7. **Distinguish Genuine Interest**

**VC:** "We're interested in investing, but we'd need you to find a lead
investor first," or "We'd like to commit, contingent on you raising the rest
of the round."

VCs often use these tactics to keep their options open without fully
committing. They're expressing interest but aren't ready to take the lead or
make a firm commitment.

**Founder’s Reply:** "We appreciate your interest in our company. We're
currently focusing on investors who are ready to commit without contingencies.
Once we secure our lead investor, we'll reach out if there's still room in the
round. In the meantime, would you be open to introducing us to any potential
lead investors in your network?"

This response politely acknowledges their interest while prioritizing more
committed investors. It also leaves the door open for future participation and
potentially leverages their network.

That’s it.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Starting a company is exciting, but many founders overlook the legal
side—until it’s too late. Whether it’s splitting equity, raising funds, or
hiring your first team member, having the right legal documents in place from
day one can save you from serious issues down the road.

**Why These Documents Are Critical**

Legal paperwork isn’t just about compliance—it protects your business, your
team, and your investors. Proper documentation ensures:

  * Founders are aligned on ownership, roles, and responsibilities.

  * Investors trust your startup, making fundraising smoother.

  * Employees and contractors don’t walk away with your IP.

  * Your company doesn’t collapse due to a legal dispute.

Many early-stage startups raise funds or start hiring without any legal
foundation, creating problems that can kill deals or cause internal conflicts
later.

**Common Mistakes Founders Make**

  1. Skipping Founder Agreements  
Many co-founders start with a handshake deal. Without a Founders' Agreement or
Restricted Stock Agreement, things get messy if someone leaves or equity
splits aren’t clear.

  2. Not Incorporating Properly  
Choosing the wrong structure (e.g., LLC instead of C-Corp) can make it harder
to raise VC funding. Investors prefer Delaware C-Corps because of standard
protections and tax advantages.

  3. No Vesting Schedule for Founders  
Without a vesting schedule, a founder who leaves early keeps all their
shares—even if they stop contributing. A 4-year vesting with a 1-year cliff is
the standard setup to prevent this.

  4. Fundraising Without Proper Documents  
Raising money without a SAFE note, convertible note, or term sheet can lead to
legal disputes, unexpected dilution, or even losing control of your startup.

  5. Not Securing Intellectual Property (IP)  
If employees or contractors build your product without signing an IP
Assignment Agreement, they own the IP, not your company. This mistake has
killed acquisition deals and lawsuits have followed.

  6. Forgetting Data & Privacy Compliance  
If you collect customer data, you need a Privacy Policy and Terms of
Service—especially if you serve users in California (CCPA) or the EU (GDPR).
Failing to do so can lead to heavy fines.

To avoid these mistakes, you need the right legal documents in place from day
one. The Startup Legal Document Pack was created with input from experienced
startup attorneys, legal associates, and venture capital firms to make sure
you’re using up-to-date, investor-approved templates.

You can access all the essential templates—from incorporation docs to
fundraising agreements—in our **[Startup Legal Document
Pack](https://theventurecrew.gumroad.com/l/startuplegaldocuments)**.

Raising money is tough for both founders and VCs, but it’s even harder for
VCs. They must persuade limited partners (LPs) to invest in their venture
capital funds.

I've analyzed how successful VCs craft pitch decks that help them raise
massive amounts of capital. Here's what I learned.

Think of fund managers as salespeople. Their pitch deck (or memo) is their
most powerful sales tool. It needs to do two things really well: hook LPs
enough to get that crucial first meeting, and serve as a compelling narrative
during and after the pitch.  

Here are four main takeaways to consider when creating a deck for LPs:

  1. The purpose of your pitch deck is to convince LPs of your ability to make outlier investments. Show how you access, make sound decisions on, and win exceptional deals.

  2. Your pitch deck should tell a clear, concise, and convincing version of your fund's story.

  3. Show, don't tell, using examples, numbers, and visuals to add credibility.

  4. Let others speak to your strengths with quotes from founders, testimonials from references, and committed LPs to establish social credibility.

But what Goes Into a $500M+ Fund Deck? Here's the winning structure I've seen
work:

  * Title: So, what's this fund called? Which fund is it?

  * Team: Who is the GP? Who else is on the team?

  * Access: How do you get access to high-quality investment opportunities? What's your advantage?

  * Ability to win: How will you win competitive deals? What's your value-add to founders?

  * Investment Focus: What are you investing in? Why? Do you have a unique insight into that focus?

  * Track record: Do you have investment experience? What's your past track record? What are your most impressive investments?

  * Fund structure: What's the size of the fund, the stage you're investing in, the number of expected investments, and other details on the fund structure?

  * Network: Who's in your orbit? Which founders, investors, and others do you collaborate with and can you show examples?

I was discussing customer discovery with an investor, and one thing became
clear—most founders don’t approach it the right way. Many believe they need a
million-dollar revenue sheet or a long list of customers to impress investors.
But what early-stage investors actually want to see is proof that you’ve done
the work to deeply understand your market.

Investors aren’t expecting you to have all the answers, but they do expect you
to have tested your assumptions. **Customer discovery isn’t just about
validating your idea—it’s about refining your understanding of who your
customers are** , what their pain points are, and how they’re currently
solving those problems.

In the early days, your vision of the problem and the ideal customer is
blurry. You might start with a hypothesis like:

> “I think our customer is a typical business with 50 employees, spending
> $100k annually on solving X type of problem in X sector.”

Through customer discovery, you sharpen that image into something like:

> “Our ideal customer is a fast-growing tech company with 100-250 employees,
> spending $250,000-$500,000 annually on this problem, and considers it a top
> 3 priority to solve in the next 6 months.”

That level of clarity is what investors want to see—not just numbers, but a
clear, well-researched understanding of your target audience and how you
arrived at that insight.

The biggest mistake founders make in customer discovery is **falling into
confirmation bias.** This happens when you unconsciously ask leading questions
that reinforce what you want to hear rather than uncovering the truth.

If you only seek validation, you risk:

  * Overestimating demand for your solution

  * Misunderstanding customer priorities

  * Building a product the market doesn’t actually need

To avoid this, focus on asking open-ended questions that challenge your
assumptions, such as:

  * How painful is this problem for you?

  * Is this problem in your top three priorities to solve in the next 12 months?

  * What results would you need to see from a solution to justify paying for it?

  * If I explained my solution, would you be ready to pay for it immediately, or would you need more information?

Customer discovery might lead you to an unexpected realization: your initial
target audience isn’t actually the best fit. That’s not a failure—it’s a
breakthrough.

Investors love when founders can say, “We initially thought our customer was
X, but after deep customer discovery, we realized it’s actually Y.” This shows
adaptability and a willingness to pivot based on real data rather than
stubbornly sticking to initial assumptions.

Another common outcome of customer discovery is recognizing that some of your
early customers aren’t the right long-term fit. For example, you might find
that selling to 10-person teams takes just as much effort as selling to
100-person teams, but the larger teams generate significantly more revenue.
Recognizing this allows you to focus on the most profitable customer segments
instead of spreading yourself thin.

What investors really want to see is that you:

  * Know exactly who your ideal customer is and why

  * Have tested and validated your assumptions through direct conversations

  * Are willing to adapt based on real market insights

  * Can prioritize the most profitable opportunities

Customer discovery isn’t just a checkbox—it’s a strategic advantage. The
founders who master it are the ones who attract investment and, more
importantly, build sustainable businesses.
