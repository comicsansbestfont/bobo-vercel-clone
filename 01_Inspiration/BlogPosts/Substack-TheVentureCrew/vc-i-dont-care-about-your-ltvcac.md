##### **TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

“I don't care about LTV/CAC ratio, what I care about is the velocity with
which invested CAC comes back in the form of LTV which I called CACD.” Says
Venture Capitalist.

So, over the weekend, I had a chat with VC. We got into talking about the
LTV/CAC ratio, and he dropped that quote I mentioned earlier. Now, you might
be curious about what this CACD thing is all about. What's up with the 'D'?
Let's break it down and find out.

> LTV: Life Time Value ; CAC : Customer Acquision Cost ; CACD: ?

A business is an engine that attracts customers, delivers something of value
to them, and then extracts that value in the form of profits. That’s what a
business is. Thus it logically follows that _the cost of attracting a new
customer needs to be less than the value we can extract from that customer._
If it costs us $15 in advertising to get a customer, and we can only make $7
from them then Houston, we have a problem. But if it costs $15 to get them,
and then once they are a customer they make a bunch of repeat purchases that
yield $75 in profit, then we are happy. Ultimately every venture of every kind
has to have a Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) that is less than the Lifetime
Value (LTV) of a customer. It’s a simple, self-evident concept.

`Yet it’s a leading cause of startup death.`

A high percentage of startups die because their cost of getting customers
turns out to be higher than they can make from them. Partly this is just
because we’re all optimists — we all think our startup is so awesome that
people will flock to become customers and they will remain customers forever.
But eventually, that optimism fades as we realize that marketing is expensive
and no customer stays forever. The immutable laws of economics set in, and at
some point, many startup founders find that their LTV/CAC ratio is slowly
draining their bank account.

> To paraphrase [Ernest Hemingway,](https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-
> hemingway-gradually-suddenly-zeitgeist/) Startups go broke two ways:
> gradually, and then suddenly.

`Investors tend to obsess over the LTV/CAC ratio.`

Investors care about your LTV/CAC ratio because it’s the essence of a
successful business. But it’s also a proxy for the potential ROI of their
investment. If you have proof that you can spend $1 on customer acquisition
activities and get $5 in value back (an LTV/CAC ratio of 5.0), investors will
want to shovel as much money as possible into that engine. Most of the VCs
look for ‘just-add-money opportunities.’ Having a business with an LTV/CAC
ratio of over 5.0 looks like a “just-add-money opportunity” to investors.

`But it’s a blunt tool that is better if sharpened.`

Let’s say that during the quarter we spent $10,000 on sales and marketing and
got 1,000 new customers — a CAC of $10. But probably some of those customers
came through word-of-mouth, some came as referrals, some came from our PR
efforts, and some came from paid advertising. So we had a blended CAC of $10,
but that doesn’t tell us anything about the relative effectiveness of each of
our different customer acquisition efforts. Which leads me to the next point:

`Not all customers are created equal.`

With every business I’ve ever run, I’ve realized at some point that 80% of our
profits were coming from 20% of our customers. It’s amazing how this tends to
be true with almost all businesses. So if we look at the LTV (Lifetime Value)
of our entire universe of customers, we’ll probably see that 20% of them have
a much higher individual LTV than the rest. Wouldn’t we want to focus our CAC
efforts on getting more of the high-LTV customers? Yes, we would.

> Therefore, [cohorts matter.](https://www.appcues.com/blog/cohort-analysis)

The two points above would indicate we want to track the LTV/CAC ratio by
customer cohort. For example, what’s the ratio of customers acquired through
Facebook advertising vs those acquired through Google advertising? Knowing
that would tell us a lot about how we should allocate advertising dollars.
What’s the LTV/CAC ratio for customers acquired through our referral program?
Knowing that would tell us how much we can afford to offer in a referral fee.
Knowing your company’s blended LTV/CAC tells you the health of the overall
engine, but it doesn’t tell you how to optimize the engine’s performance for
the next quarter. Tracking customer cohorts tells you that.

**Also, velocity matters.**

> `But do you know? - most of the VC don’t care about the LTV/CAC ratio, what
> they cares about is the velocity with which invested CAC comes back in the
> form of LTV.`

They generally used CACD rather than CAC — the D is for “doubled”. CACD
answers the question, “If we spend $12 in customer acquisition activities, how
long does it take for us to get $24 back?” As an investor, he wants to see a
business with a CACD of less than eight months. This formula gets to the heart
of an inherent flaw in the LTV/CAC ratio: it doesn’t include a time factor. A
business with an LTV/CAC ratio over 5.0 might seem good at first, but if you
have to service a customer for 10 years before you make back the money you
spent getting him, then it doesn’t seem so good, right?

_**Velocity matters.**_ So think about how you can measure CACD for your
business. Putting $12 somewhere where it returns with a high velocity will
accelerate your engine of growth.

That’s it! So, from now it’s not LTV or CAC it’s LTV & CACD.

##### **TODAY’S QUICK DIVE**

  * In 2023, major asset managers spent less on GP stakes due to market uncertainty and fundraising concerns.

  * GP stake deals involving minority ownership dropped to 17.2% of total deal value, down from 84% in 2019.

  * Petershill Partners is now preparing to deploy capital from its $5 billion fund after a cautious approach in 2023.

  * Bonaccord Capital Partners and Hunter Point Capital were the most active, completing three GP stake deals each in 2023.

  * Blue Owl Capital closed its fifth GP stakes fund at $12.9 billion in January 2023 and started raising for its sixth fund.

  * Blackstone reduced its fundraising target for its Blackstone Capital Partners IX fund from $26 billion to $20 billion.

  * Q4 of 2023 saw a rebound in overall GP stake deals, with 26 announced, but a shift towards majority control transactions.

  * In 2024, industry players anticipate more add-on acquisitions and minority stake sales, with a decrease in massive strategic deals

A study by Carta shows that as of Q3 2023, the "deep tech" sectors such as
Energy, Hardware, Medical Devices, and Biotech are experiencing notable
growth, with consistent positive headcount trends since 2019.

The chart reveals a decline in overall startup headcount growth, especially in
industries like SaaS, where hiring failed to match departures in recent
quarters. Early 2021 saw peak growth across various sectors, with Biotech
leading at 5.5 hires for every departure. In contrast, Edtech and Gaming
currently face the lowest headcount growth, with only 0.7 new hires for each
departure. The data also emphasizes the ongoing deep tech revival in venture
capital. [More
