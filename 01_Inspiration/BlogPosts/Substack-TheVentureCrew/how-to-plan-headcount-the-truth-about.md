##### **FROM OUR PARTNER - ROCKET**

**[Rocket](https://www.rocket.new/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=venturedailydigest&utm_campaign=23rdsep)
, based in India, has secured $15 million in seed funding** co-led by
Salesforce Ventures and Accel, along with Together Fund.

In just 15 weeks from launch the platform has gained over 400,000 users across
180+ countries who have produced more than 500,000 apps.

Unlike first-generation vibe coding tools focused on mockups and prototypes,
**[Rocket](https://www.rocket.new/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=venturedailydigest&utm_campaign=23rdsep)
calls itself the first true “vibe solutioning” platform**, solving not only
Day 1 startup problems but also Day 0 (problem framing and context) and Day 2
(iterating, integrating, deploying).

By generating production-grade apps with backend logic, enterprise-scale
architecture, and real integrations, Rocket tackles tech debt and makes AI-
native development practical.

##### **START WITH**

US tech giants — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia — earned
nearly **$2T in revenue in 2024** (up 15% YoY). Together, they’re now worth
more than **3x the entire unicorn ecosystem**. After a wave of layoffs, hiring
is back (+7% average headcount growth in 2024). The next chapter of their
growth story? AI.

  * **Capex surge** : Amazon, Microsoft, and Google each plan to spend $75B–$100B in 2025 on AI-driven data centers. Scale itself is becoming a strategic advantage.

  * **Cloud + AI demand** : Azure grew 31% last quarter (13 points from AI). Google Cloud is struggling to keep pace as compute demand outstrips supply.

  * **M &A comeback**: Alphabet’s $33B Wiz acquisition signals that AI will fuel the next big wave of deals. Nvidia, meanwhile, is hoovering up startups to lock in chip demand.

  * **Physical AI bets** : Humanoid robotics pilots (Apptronik, Agility, Figure) show how deep pockets let incumbents test entire new categories.

  * **Agent race** : Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are embedding AI agents into workflows, where distribution + infra advantage ensures they dominate early use cases.

AI isn’t leveling the playing field — it’s reinforcing the moat. Big tech can
pour hundreds of billions into infra, scoop up talent and startups, and expand
into frontier bets like humanoids. For startups, the play isn’t to outspend
them, but to find niches they can’t (or won’t) move fast enough to own. (Read

Carta’s new 2025
[guide](https://carta.com/uk/en/learn/startups/compensation/headcount-
planning/) frames headcount planning as more than a budget exercise — it’s one
of the clearest signals to investors about whether a startup is disciplined or
reckless.

  * **Equity and ownership impact** : Every hire costs cash _and_ equity. Carta stresses that each grant reshapes your cap table, so sloppy hiring can compound dilution quickly.

  * **Retention and alignment** : By March 2025, only 65% of employees hired in 2023 were still in-role. That stat underlines why roles must tie directly to clear milestones (product launches, ARR targets, compliance) instead of “we’ll figure it out later.”

  * **Forecasting the true cost** : The strongest startups forecast 12–18 months ahead and model not just salaries, but the ownership cost of each hire. Carta’s tools now let founders see dilution in real time — useful for board reviews and investor conversations.

A headcount plan isn’t just ops hygiene. It’s a strategic roadmap linking
hiring, ownership, and outcomes. Founders who tie every role to a milestone
and model dilution avoid costly, reactive mistakes — and build far more
investor confidence.

For decades, Stanford, Harvard, and Wharton MBAs were a near-guarantee to
break into venture. But PitchBook’s recent
[analysis](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/is-an-mba-still-worth-it-if-
you-want-to-make-it-in-v) shows that the advantage is fading fast.

  * **The numbers** : Around 50 Harvard MBAs and 30 Stanford MBAs joined VC firms last year, with a median starting salary of $177,500. Yet the share of new VCs with MBAs has dropped from 44% in the early 2000s to ~32% today.

  * **The shift** : Firms now prize “builders” from places like OpenAI, SpaceX, and Palantir over B-school résumés. These hires bring direct operating experience and strong founder networks.

  * **Still a signal** : Certain schools (Stanford, Harvard, Wharton, LBS, Columbia, Kellogg) show a statistical boost in investment performance, according to new research. Alumni networks also continue to drive deal flow.

  * **The tradeoff** : An MBA can still open doors, but it comes with a ~$200K opportunity cost. Meanwhile, AI is replacing many junior VC tasks, narrowing entry-level roles.

The MBA badge is no longer the default path into venture. It may help at
specific firms and networks, but increasingly, operating at a breakout startup
is the stronger credential.

##### **SOMETHING MORE**

In six months, Cluely grew to 150k followers and hundreds of millions of
views. Roy Lee shared what he’s learned about virality — how it really works,
when it matters, and why hype alone won’t build a company.

**1\. The law of X virality**

  * A tweet that deserves to go viral will go viral, if it crosses the threshold of a few thousand views.

  * Follower count beyond ~10k matters less than you think; the algorithm is ruthlessly content-dependent.

  * Virality sense doesn’t turn bad content into good. It only takes a good post from 200k views to 2M+.

Focus on creating content worth sharing — virality is an amplifier, not a
crutch.

**2\. Virality ≠ growth**

  * Cluely saw memes rack up 50M+ views with fewer than 100 downloads.

  * Virality only matters if it converts: top-of-funnel is useful for testing, user feedback, and brand awareness — but product quality drives retention.

  * If your product isn’t close to the best in its category, mindshare won’t save you.

Don’t confuse reach with traction. Measure conversions, not views.

**3\. When virality helps — and when it doesn’t**

Virality accelerates a solid product — it doesn’t replace one.

**4\. The Cluely playbook in action**

  * Cluely is post-PMF in some segments (interviews, enterprise workflows), but still iterating for broader consumer markets.

  * The goal: create _magic moments_ across all user types, not just niche use cases.

  * Virality is a lever to test markets quickly, but their long-term bet is product-led growth.

Use virality as a spark — but make sure your product can sustain the fire.

For 20+ years, if you wanted people to find your company online, you learned
the rules of SEO: keywords, backlinks, rankings. You played the Google game.
And that worked, until now.

In 2025, the game is changing. Fast.

Search isn’t happening on browsers the way it used to. It’s happening inside
models. People are asking ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity instead of Google.
Apple is baking AI-native search into Safari. That’s a tectonic shift.

And with it comes a new playbook: Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO).

> SEO helped you rank.  
> GEO helps you get remembered.

Classic SEO was about getting on the first page of search results. GEO is
about getting mentioned in the answer itself, the paragraph ChatGPT gives your
potential customer when they ask, “What’s the best waterproof winter jacket?”

In that response, is your brand even mentioned? If not, you’re invisible.

Where SEO is optimised for Google’s algorithm, GEO is optimised for how LLMs
think, how they synthesise, cite, and share information from across the
internet.

**LLMs don’t list. They reason. They remember. They compress.** So instead of
fighting to rank on page one, you’re now fighting to become part of the
model’s memory.

**GEO ≠ Gaming the system**

This isn’t about hacks or stuffing keywords. It’s about building content and
presence that earns you a place in the AI layer.

And here’s where the model era is different:

  * LLMs are paywalled, not ad-driven.

  * They’re personalised, not one-size-fits-all.

  * They summarise, not paginate.

That means brands need to think differently. You’re not bidding for ad slots
or traffic. You’re trying to become a trusted reference, something the model
brings up organically because you’re seen as legit.

**So what matters in GEO?**

You want to be cited by the model. That means:

  * Creating dense, well-structured content that models can parse.

  * Using summary formats, bullet points, and context-rich explanations.

  * Being referenced in authoritative sources and public knowledge bases.

This is about model relevance, not search rank.

We’re seeing the rise of platforms like Profound, Daydream, and Goodie that
help brands understand how they’re showing up in model outputs and why.

Some startups are even fine-tuning their own mini-LLMs to simulate how major
models think, allowing them to test prompts at scale and adjust content
strategy accordingly.

Canada Goose did this. They weren’t just looking at traffic. They wanted to
know:

> “Does the model think of us when someone asks about premium winter jackets?”

That’s the new game: unaided model awareness.

**From clicks to citations**

You don’t need 10 blue links anymore. You need one line in the AI’s answer.

New metrics are emerging:

  * Reference Rate: how often you’re cited by LLMs.

  * Sentiment Memory: how you’re framed in model outputs.

  * Competitive Share of Voice in AI-generated responses.

This is SEO 2.0 but deeper, more dynamic, and closer to the conversion moment.

**Early-stage? This is your edge.**

For founders and growth teams, GEO is a first-mover opportunity.

Just like Adwords in 2003 or Facebook targeting in 2013, this is a new
channel. The difference? The channel is the model.

And the model is becoming the new front door to commerce. If your startup
isn’t present there, if the model doesn’t remember you, you’re not just
missing traffic. You’re missing trust.

The startups that win will:

  * Understand how to create GEO-friendly content

  * Use new tools to monitor model perception

  * Adapt quickly as LLM behaviour evolves

GEO isn’t static. Every model update may change the rules. Just like Google
updates used to wreck SEO rankings overnight, you’ll need to keep testing,
tracking, and iterating.

This isn’t just about visibility. GEO is a wedge into something bigger:

  * Real-time brand management inside LLMs

  * Autonomous marketing loops that optimise messaging daily

  * Full-stack platforms that own the loop from monitoring to creation to response

The companies that get this right won’t just sell insights. They’ll become the
channel itself.

Just like Shopify became more than a tool for e-commerce, the GEO winners will
become the system of record for _brand-model interaction_.

In a world where AI answers everything, the real question for your startup is:
“Will the model remember you?”

Because if it doesn’t, your next customer might not either. Read the original
article [here.](https://a16z.com/geo-over-seo/)

Most ideas, especially in B2C, get validated in one of four ways:

**[This framework](https://www.consumerstartups.com/p/idea-validation-
framework-backed)** defines the differences between each path to validation.

  1. **Signal Aggregation**

Founders should test an idea’s viability through small experiments that
provide evidence (signals) of potential success before building a full
product.

Common signals include landing page sign-ups, social media engagement, ad
click-through rates, and customer interview feedback.

  2. **Strong Beta**

Achieving strong early traction with a beta product is another popular
validation approach for founders. Success metrics vary across industries,
e.g., high user numbers and retention for consumer social apps, and healthy
revenue for B2C marketplaces.

The process typically starts with a hypothesis for solving a problem. The
founder builds a basic version to test the hypothesis. Beta products are often
rudimentary, lacking polish, due to the emphasis on speed over perfection.
This approach aligns with the lean methodology of launching quickly and
iterating based on feedback.

  3. **True Fans**

This approach is similar to the Strong Beta approach, as it involves launching
a beta product. However, instead of focusing on significant traction metrics
like revenue or user acquisition, the founder seeks to identify a small group
of fanatic users who deeply love the product despite its limited features. The
key is finding 20-50 users who would be disappointed if the product were to go
away. These passionate fans, rather than large user numbers, serve as the
validation signal.

  4. **Visionary**

This approach is the least common among the founders interviewed, as it
requires a clear vision and plan for the product from the outset. Typically,
the founder has a close personal connection to the problem being solved and a
strong understanding of what needs to be done to address it.

Founders often struggle with pricing their products correctly early on. Many
make the mistake of setting prices based on their costs, especially in non-
software startups. While this might seem logical, it’s not the best approach.
Here’s why you should consider “unreasonable” pricing instead:

**The Problem with Cost-Based Pricing**

  1. It doesn’t account for the value you’re providing to customers.

  2. It can limit your growth potential and ability to invest in improving your product.

  3. It may attract price-sensitive customers who aren’t your ideal target market.

**The Benefits of “Unreasonable” Pricing**

  1. **Identifying Your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**

     * High initial prices help you quickly identify customers who feel the pain point most acutely.

     * These customers are willing to pay more for a solution, even if it’s not perfect yet.

  2. **Validating Market Demand**

     * If people are willing to pay a premium, it confirms there’s a strong need for your product.

     * This validation can save weeks of experiments and help you focus on the right target audience.

  3. **Accelerating Product Development**

     * Higher initial revenue allows you to invest more in improving your product faster.

     * You can build specifically for your ICP, ensuring product-market fit.

**Real-World Example**

I see a lot of founders launch a website, with:

Also, set the initial price on the higher end. Despite this - they have seen
good outcomes of getting a few people onboard 5-6, why? They felt the pain
point so strongly that they wanted it solved at all costs.

**The Inverse Relationship**

There’s an inverse relationship between how painful a problem is and how
“perfect” the product needs to be:

**When to Launch**

Once your product is 70-80% ready for your ICP, they will likely convert. If
not, it may indicate that the problem isn’t worth investing more time into, as
the product will be hard to grow.

**Long-Term Strategy**

While starting with “unreasonable” pricing can be beneficial, it’s important
to note that this approach isn’t permanent. As you grow and expand your
market, you may need to adjust your pricing strategy. However, the initial
high pricing helps validate the market, identify your ICP, and provide capital
leverage for faster growth.

Remember, don’t let perfect be the enemy of good. If you’re solving a truly
painful problem, **your early adopters will be willing to pay a premium for an
imperfect solution.**

Even in one of the previous writeups, we have shared **[5
frameworks](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/161364764/how-to-price-your-
product)** that can help you to find the best pricing strategy for your
startup.

Deciding whether to offer a freemium model is a common dilemma for founders.
Many try out freemium strategies, but not all SaaS companies can replicate the
success of Dropbox or Typeform.

Done wrong, freemium can end up cannibalizing your paid user base while also
draining your company’s precious engineering and customer support resources.

So how can you determine if it’s the right move for your company?

The most reliable way to find out is through A/B testing. However, getting
solid results can take a long time, especially if you’re looking at the impact
on virality and your viral cycle is six months or longer.

If you can’t wait that long or aren’t set up for a full A/B test, consider
these “Three Factors for Freemium Strategy”:

  1. **Does your paid plan have a gross margin of 80–90%?**  
If you have a lower gross margin — for example because your product is not
fully self-service, requires extensive customer support or is extremely costly
in terms of tech infrastructure — freemium will probably not work for you.

  2. **Does your free plan attract the right audience?**  
If your free users are too different from your paying users, your free-to-
paying conversion will be low — and you’ll risk developing your product for
the wrong audience.

  3. **Is your product inherently viral?**  
If your answer is no, that doesn’t make it a complete no-go, but it does mean
that it’s much less likely that freemium is right for you.

In the end, freemium only makes sense if a certain percentage of your free
users do one of three things:

  * Eventually, convert to paid,

  * Refer paying customers, or

  * Provide the kind of valuable feedback that will improve your product.

A freemium product that fails to achieve any of these effects will merely
saddle you with extra costs and distract you from servicing your most
important users.

Also, check out this interesting article on [why companies fail with
freemium](https://medium.com/swlh/why-do-companies-fail-with-
freemium-600e6b607127). I highly recommend it — definitely worth a read.
