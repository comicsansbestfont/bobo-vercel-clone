# Pitch Deck Storytelling Template: Tell the Right Story to Investors

Every founder believes they have an awesome team and technology; the question is, what will investors think? In fundraising, most founders are tempted to jump straight into PowerPoint to get started.

**Don't do it!** Remember "It's not about the slides; it's about the story."

So how do you tell a compelling story? First, figure out which type of story you should be telling.

Next, use your problem and solution statements to emotionally and intellectually engage your audience, and be sure to adequately address all the expected areas in the deck.

With all that in mind, you'll be ready to follow simple steps to craft your winning deck.

## The Four Pitch Narratives

The first and most important thing to decide about your pitch is which story you should be telling. Fiction may have seven plot archetypes, but pitches tend to fall into one of four narratives, listed here in order of strength:

### 1. Traction
This is the story you want to be telling. Maybe your revenue or user base is growing really fast (>20% month-over-month), or you've closed deals with major customers or partners. If you have traction that will impress investors, then tell a traction story.

### 2. Team
Maybe you don't have wow-factor traction yet, but you and your cofounders are successful second-time founders or have a management team with impressive pedigree. In that case, tell a people story.

### 3. Technology
Or perhaps you don't have strong traction but have created a technological breakthrough in an important field. Then you could tell a technology story.

### 4. Vision
This is the story of last resort. If you don't have impressive traction, a highly regarded team, or a technological breakthrough, then you have to fall back on a vision story of how you want to change the world.

**Be realistic in your self-analysis of what qualifies as "impressive."** Every founder thinks they have an awesome team and technology; the question is, what will investors think? If you're not sure which story you should tell, then get some feedback from investors or other founders.

## The Pixar Storytelling Framework for Pitch Decks

A while ago, the writers at Pixar shared their 22 Rules of Storytelling. Among them was the arc of a successful Pixar story:

> *"Once upon a time there was ___. Every day, ___. One day ___. Because of that, ___. Because of that, ___. Until finally ___."*

Creating an investor pitch is all about telling a good story. Though it's tempting to get pulled in, remember that your pitch isn't a series of individual slides. Before you get caught up in visuals and design, use this template that follows the classic arc to help you build your own story.

Take time to reflect on your audience, the impression you want to make, and the story that will leave a lasting impact. Consider each section and write down your thoughts *before* you create slides. Read through several times and tweak to make sure the story flows (and leaves investors begging to be part of your company!).

Once you've created your outline, then move on to designing your pitch deck.
