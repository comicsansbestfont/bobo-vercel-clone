##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

If you're a founder raising capital at the earliest stages, chances are you've
heard the question: "What traction do you have?"

And maybe your honest answer is: "None yet." Maybe your product isn’t live.
Maybe it’s half-built. Maybe you’re still figuring out your first users.

That’s okay. At the pre-seed stage, investors know that full traction is rare.
But what they do want to see is something else something just as important.

> **Investors don’t just look for traction they look for a plan to get it**

Recently, I spoke with a VC fund partner who explained how he thinks about
traction when evaluating pre-seed startups: he’s forgiving about the numbers,
but not about the thinking behind them.

Yes, pilots, early sales, or case studies help. But more critical is your
thesis for how traction will come. Not guesses. Not buzzwords. A clear,
reasoned plan.

Because here’s the truth:

> A project isn’t a business, until it makes money.

You can build the coolest product in the world, but unless it brings in more
money than it costs, it’s not a business. It’s a side project. A prototype. A
dream. Investors want to know how you’ll cross that line.

**Your GTM plan** is your logic map for how your startup goes from zero to
something real. It shows that you know who your customers are, how to reach
them, and how to keep them.

The worst answer is:

> “The product will be so good it’ll grow virally.”

That’s not a plan. That’s hope.

Instead, think like this:

  * “We’re a B2B SaaS startup targeting HR teams at 50–500 person companies. We’ll start by hiring two AEs to outbound prospects in healthcare and manufacturing, where we already have warm intros.”

  * “Our initial users are hobbyist photographers. We’ll partner with 5 large YouTube creators in the space to drive our first 10,000 signups.”

See the difference? That’s a thesis. It shows you understand your market and
the path to traction even if you haven’t walked it yet.

**Founders need to show they’re building a business, not just a product**

Investors don’t expect everything to be figured out. But they do expect you to
show a clear plan to get there. They need to know you’re not just obsessed
with building but equally serious about selling.

If you can show that, you don’t need traction yet. You just need the
conviction, logic, and strategy that will lead to it.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Crafting the perfect pitch deck is only half the battle. The real challenge?
Getting it in front of the right investors.

Many founders build great stories but stumble when it comes to actually
finding investors who are a good fit. Here’s a clear, step-by-step guide to
building a targeted investor list that increases your chances of getting a
“yes.”

**1\. Define your “investor strike zone”**

Before looking for investors, figure out what kind of investor you're looking
for. This helps you avoid wasting time on people who’ll never say yes.

Ask yourself:

  * **Where are you based?** Many investors have geographic preferences. If your team is 70% in Europe but you're a Delaware C-corp with a U.S.-based CEO, call yourself a U.S. startup.

  * **Do you have any founder affinity?** Some investors focus on specific groups—like underrepresented founders, alumni from specific schools, or founders with niche backgrounds.

  * **What’s your industry?** Be clear and honest. Don’t call a fintech play a healthcare startup just because it touches healthcare. It’s fintech.

  * **What’s your business model?** Are you DTC? SaaS? Marketplace? Investors often specialize in a few models. Knowing your model helps you find the ones who get it.

  * **What stage are you at?**

    * Pre-seed: Building the product, likely no revenue. Raises of $200K–$3M.

    * Seed: The product is working, with some early traction. Raises of $1M–$15M.

    * Series A: Significant traction, scaling. Typically $10M and up.

  * **How much are you raising?** Be specific. Investors want to know you have a plan and know what it’ll cost

**2\. Build your investor list**

Let’s say you’re building a dev tools SaaS company based in NYC and raising
$2M. Here’s how to create a list of relevant investors:

**Step 1: List similar companies**

Find 15–20 startups similar to yours, not identical, just playing in the same
arena. If you’re Lyft, don’t look at Uber’s investors. Look at those in the
broader “mobility” or “sharing economy” space.

- list of similar companies

Use TechCrunch, Crunchbase, etc., to find them. Even you can check out our
[investor’s database. ](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/35-investor-
contact-databases-and)

**Step 2: Find their investors**

For each company, look up:

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NJtt!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-
post-
media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57555bca-7ccc-4053-83f6-ac7d42a2c5a0_963x370.jpeg)Some
of the investors that invested in Earthly Technologies.

This gives you a solid top-of-funnel list.

**Step 3: Use “Similar Companies” tools**

Crunchbase shows “similar companies” for each startup. Use that to discover
more companies, then repeat step 2 to expand your investor list.

**Step 4: Expand by investor**

Once you’ve got ~50 startups and 200 investors on your list, start noticing
patterns. Some investor names will show up again and again. These are your
power players.

Look up these investors on Crunchbase. See who else they’ve invested in, and
who they often co-invest with. Add those names to your list too.

**Step 5: Prioritize your outreach**

You now have a working list. Time to sort and prioritize:

  * Who are the most active investors in your space?

  * Who has the best reputation among founders?

  * Who’s most aligned with your model and stage?

Ask other founders, reach out at events, and do your homework. The most
talked-about investors are usually the ones worth starting with.

**Step 6: Use Crunchbase “Hubs”**

Some Crunchbase lists are gold. For example: “Developer tools companies with
fewer than 1,000 employees.” Use these as sanity checks to make sure you
haven’t missed any relevant players.

**Final step: Qualify your list**

Now cross-check everything.

  * Do these investors still actively invest?

  * Do they back your stage, geography, and business model?

  * Do they lead rounds or just follow?

  * Is there a specific partner at the firm who’s the best fit?

Overlay this data with your “strike zone” criteria and narrow it down to a
high-priority list.

And don’t forget: sometimes investors make exceptions. If you’ve got a strong
referral or a unique angle, even someone who _technically_ doesn’t match your
profile might still be open.

**Yes, it’s work—but it’s worth it**

Spend an afternoon doing this well, and you’ll not only build a quality
investor pipeline, but you’ll also sharpen your understanding of the space
you’re operating in.

Chris posted **[this
framework](https://x.com/frantzfries/status/1488195684121530370)** in January
of 2022.

Since then, he’s founded a [YC-backed startup](https://loops.so/) that makes
it incredibly simple and easy to send transactional emails and sequences for
any company, with a revenue growth chart that looks like this:

Here’s the framework:

  1. Pick a customer you enjoy talking to

  2. Talk to 15 of them to be sure you do (and can get in touch with them)

  3. Ask them to tell you a problem that’s more important than an 8 on a scale of 1-10

  4. If that problem is generalizable, make the smallest MVP you can (no code required, if possible)

  5. Ask the 15 people if they’d pay for what you built, or would pay if you prioritized a certain feature they ask for

  6. Repeat, with 50 new people. If the feature requests you’re getting are too varied, you may be solving the wrong problem.

Super practical and simple, but true! If you can’t find people to pay for your
product, you likely don’t have a product that can turn into a business. Click

If you're a founder with less than ~12 months of runway going into 2024, you
have to re-read Paul Graham’s [The Fatal
Pinch.](https://paulgraham.com/pinch.html) Assume you will NOT get a bridge
round, and figure out what other options you have ASAP.

Let me share a key point that every founder should consider while considering
their burn rate -

“The "fatal pinch" that happens to a lot of startups. It's when they've got
some cash in the bank, but they're bleeding money every month and not growing.
They think they'll be fine 'cause they'll just raise more money from
investors. Big mistake.

The problem is, that **founders often kid themselves about how easy it'll be
to get more funding.** It's way harder the second time around because:

  1. The company's burning through cash faster now

  2. Investors expect a lot more from companies that have already raised money

  3. The startup is starting to look like a failure

This whole situation is like a nasty feedback loop. Founders think they'll
easily raise more money, so they don't try hard enough to become profitable,
which makes it even harder to raise money.

To avoid this mess, YC tells founders to act like the money they raise is the
last they'll ever get. If you're already in the fatal pinch, you've got three
options: shut down, make more money, or spend less (which usually means firing
people).

If you decide to keep going, you need to focus on making more money ASAP. This
might mean changing what you're selling or doing more consulting-type work.
Just be careful not to slide too far into pure consulting.

The good news is, that lots of successful startups have had near-death
experiences and survived. You just gotta realize you're in trouble before it's
too late. If you're in the fatal pinch, you are.”
