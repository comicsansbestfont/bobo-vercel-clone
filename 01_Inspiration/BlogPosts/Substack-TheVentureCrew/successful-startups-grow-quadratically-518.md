##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

>
> _— Jason Cohen_

[In his [long and mathematical]
essay](https://longform.asmartbear.com/exponential-growth/index.html), Jason
suggests an alternate model for how fast-growing companies grow. I like his
thesis, so I’m going to do my best to synthesize it for you today.

Because, in his own words: **…understanding the model is useful not only for
predicting growth but also because understanding the foundational drivers of
growth allows us to take smarter actions to create growth in our own
companies.**

First, he dispels the notion of “exponential” by looking at some popular
companies that grew rapidly, and who often get dubbed as examples of this
growth model.

Let’s take a look.

It’s been a minute since high school math…

  * **Exponential growth** = growing by a **multiple**. For example: In year 1 you grow by 10, in year 2 by 100, in year 3 by 1000.

  * **Quadratic growth =** growing by adding a **constant**. For example: Growing in year 1 by 10, then in year 2 by 20, in year 3 by 30.

In both, growth is clearly still _accelerating_ , just at wildly _different_
_rates_. To drive the point home:

**Facebook** is the definition of hyper-growth—getting to $50B in revenue
[faster](http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/how-facebook-became-one-of-the-fastest-
growing-companies-in-u-s-
history-1.1213047?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_medium=post)
than any company in history. The product is “viral”—friends bring other
friends—which theoretically leads to “exponential growth.” But Facebook didn’t
grow exponentially in the number of monthly active users:

Essentially linear for nearly twenty years, only exponential in the first four
years.

> **Slack** was [the fastest-growing enterprise software company
> ever](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2018/11/30/how-slack-became-
> the-fastest-growing-enterprise-software-
> ever?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_medium=post),
> going from $0 to $10M ARR in their first 10 months, and 0 to 10,000,000
> active users in just five years. It’s also a “viral” product—organizations
> invite their members, who then create their own Slack-groups and invite
> others. So surely Slack has exponential growth?

> Slack’s [own data](https://slack.com/blog/news/work-is-fueled-by-true-
> engagement?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_medium=post)
> shows initial quadratic growth, followed by years of linear growth.
>
> _— Jason Cohen_

So, given there’s no proof of an exponential growth model in startups — even
looking at real-world data from the fastest growing companies (he also
investigated HubSpot and Dropbox) — Jason points out that in fact… **hyper-
growth is quadratic.**

It’s not enough to just say that growth in real life is quadratic. We have to
be able to know _why_ this model makes sense, as this will give us a better
understanding of the growth drivers in our own companies.

Luckily, Jason gives us a **first-principles explanation** so we have that
insight, using the life-cycle of a marketing campaign as an example.

In my experience, marketing campaigns follow this pattern:

At the foot of the curve, we’ve launched a new campaign, but it’s ineffective;
we haven’t figured out the best design and messaging and calls-to-action for
this new medium and audience. Sometimes we never figure it out, and abandon
the effort.

But in the case that we unlock the secret of efficacy, the campaign rapidly
reaches a natural level of contribution; in this example, a number of “sales
per week.” The specific level depends on many things: ad inventory, our
budget, audience receptivity, and the consonance between the audience and our
target market. Next, we enter the optimization phase.

We A/B Test our way to incrementally better results. Also, we enjoy the result
of multiple exposures—most people need to see the ad more than once before
they act.

Finally, we enter a phase of decline. There are various causes, all
instructive:

  * **The audience is saturated.** Everyone in the channel has seen the ad more times than is required to act; it’s now falling on deaf ears. Even if the audience is growing, the number of new people is small compared to the number of people who were new to us when we began the campaign

  * **The channel declines.** A popular media site loses readers through over-monetization. An event that was well-attended loses favour. A newsletter that is frequent and insightful becomes less frequent or other writers take over. A podcast moves to a closed platform and loses many listeners.

  * **The auction becomes uneconomical.** For auction-based systems like Google and Facebook advertisements, or other zero-sum programs like affiliates or limited-inventory spots on newsletters or podcasts, the winner is the one who will pay the most. What is cost-effective for one bidder will be laughably overpriced for another, due to better conversion rates, higher revenue per customer, higher profitability per customer, or due to categorization as a “loss leader” or other way of ascribing value beyond immediate pay-back.

In my experience, marketing campaigns follow this pattern:

He calls this…

Whether it’s a marketing campaign or a new product release, growth initially
accelerates as early issues are solved, then grows roughly linearly as things
are optimized, and then starts dipping over time. That slowdown/decay is
natural as things scale.

But, we don’t do single campaigns or releases, do we…we add new ones. Some end
up being bigger than others, some can be better optimized, or decline sooner,
and some decay more steeply than others.

**So, companies that want to continue growing quickly after their first
product reaches scale, must launch new products into new markets.**

This leads to a variety of Elephant Curves across time —which, if plotted
together — look very quadratic.

The consequence of knowing that the growth we encounter at work is quadratic
is important, as we’re all trying to understand (and likely change) growth
drivers. So, “getting the right language, and the right model, will lead to
correct analysis, and right action.”

**And to leave you with something more actionable here:**

  * It’s great to add a feature to an existing product, but significant additional growth comes from increasing carrying capacity or creating a new avenue of growth. Early on you should focus on winning market share in one space, creating the first Elephant Curve, but after the product matures, something more drastic is required: Wholly new products, or updates significant enough to address new markets.

  * It’s well-known that companies need to add additional products to continue fast growth after achieving scale. However, the second product is highly unlikely to achieve the same market share and monetary scale as the first, so there needs to be multiple, not just one. This requires serious investment, parallel efforts, and the chutzpah to kill off the ideas that aren’t working.

  * Because word-of-mouth-driven growth is so much more effective than marketing-driven growth (both in cost-per-customer and in that unlike direct advertising it grows automatically as the company grows), it is worth a great deal of time trying to figure out how to build that into the product, rather than relying only on the marketing team.

##### **STARTUP INVESTMENT WORTH EXPLORING**

**What got my attention** : **[PowerBox
Technology](https://wefunder.com/powerbox.technology)** is tackling a massive,
costly problem for industrial manufacturers—grid instability, high energy
costs, and inefficient renewable integration. Instead of relying on expensive
and unreliable backup systems, their modular hardware and AI-driven software
work together to prevent disruptions, lower energy bills, and make renewable
energy seamless for factories.

**Why it matters:**

  * Grid instability causes millions in lost productivity for manufacturers.

  * Smart energy management lowers costs while improving efficiency.

  * Seamless renewable integration moves industries toward sustainability.

**Why I’m watching:**

  * Three active pilots, including a packaging factory losing 1-2% of sales due to grid instability.

  * Backed by the University of Illinois, NASA, NSF, and top industry advisors.

  * Equity crowdfunding campaign nearing $55K, with additional investment commitments.

They’re raising $500K to scale their solution and bring PowerBlock to market
in 2025.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

 _Today's deep dive is a bit different—I’m answering FAQs straight from your
DMs and emails! Got a question? Reply here or shoot me[an
email](mailto:sahil.venturecrew@gmail.com)._

This is one of the most common question I received in my DMs. So here’s the
answer - don't raise so much money from investors.

I know, I know. How do a bunch of VCs get away with suggesting to founders
that they should be raising LESS VC money? Who do we think we are, anyway?

Most people in the tech startup ecosystem have been conditioned to believe
that VC funding is the golden ticket to startup success.

But here's the kicker: many wildly successful companies either didn't raise VC
money, waited to raise, or barely touched what they raised. Yes, really. For
example, way back in the day...

**The Microsoft Model**

When Microsoft launched in 1975, founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen opted not
to raise VC funding. When they finally took their first (and only) VC
investment 5 years later, it wasn't because they needed the money.

They took the investment because the lead investor was a friend and advisor.
As of 2014, that investment was still in Microsoft's bank.

They never spent it.

"Ok, ok," I can hear you think. "That was like 100 years ago. No way you could
build a massive company without tons of VC funding today."

Well...

**What about Babylist?**

Babylist started as baby registry in 2012. And now, 14 years later, the brand
includes a growing media business, a thriving content marketing machine, a
showroom that’s become a destination for expecting celebrities and
influencers, and a health and wellness platform.

And founder Natalie Gordon basically bootstrapped the biz until 2021, when she
raised a $40m Series C round.

For the first 11 years of the business, Babylist's strategy was
straightforward:

  1. build something her users truly needed

  2. ship quickly

  3. earn revenue

  4. re-invest the revenue back into the business

Since she didn't have a bunch of investors hounding her to hit outrageous
growth milestones, Natalie was able to prioritize profitability and user-
experience.

Because Babylist's growth depended on their revenue – not outside funding –
hiring was slower than at VC-backed competitors. And that allowed Natalie to
ensure that every employee on the team was aligned to the same mission: build
for the customer.

And ultimately, this was her moat.

Plus, Natalie could take her time determining how to take the business from a
baby registry into the empire it is today.

And when Natalie was finally ready to raise the big Series C round, she didn't
suddenly get diluted out of her own company.

Pretty cool, right?

Then there's same case for Tuft + Needle

**VC Money Comes with Strings**

Let's get real about VC money.

When you take VC money, you're not just getting cash; you're selling a piece
of your company.

It can also lead to:

  1. Pressure to achieve rapid growth at all costs.

  2. Misaligned incentives between founders and investors.

  3. A focus on vanity metrics rather than sustainable business practices.

It's like trying to turn your startup into a race car... when maybe what you
really need is a good 'ole minivan.

**So, what's the move?**

Many of you reading this might think that your only course of action is to
raise from VCs. But that may not be the case.

Here are some tips to keep your startup lean:

  1. Focus on unit economics from day one. Understand your costs and revenue at a granular level.

  2. Wait to hit certain revenue milestones before hiring additional teammates.

  3. Explore alternative funding sources like revenue-based financing, crowdfunding, or bank loans.

  4. If you do need to raise VC money, approach it strategically. Raise what you need, not what you can get.

It's highly plausible that having a lean mindset mentality will force you to
grow without outside capital. And when you don't need capital, that's when the
investors come running.

That is a powerful place to be, indeed.

**Harsh Truth: 3 out of 5 startups would never find their PMF, and would
fail.**

**How to determine if you have the Product/Market Fit?**

People often say funnily, "Product-market Fit is like porn...when you see it,
you just know." In qualitative terms ...

[](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/)Image Source: David Rusenko, Weebly

"When the customers aren’t quite getting much value out of the
product/service, word of mouth isn’t spreading, usage isn’t growing that fast
(spikes in the months where you advertise), press reviews are kind of “blah”,
the sales cycle takes too long, and most of the deals never close" - [Marc
Andreessen](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html).

Most startups that have raised ($5-$10 Mn) Series A funding, assume they’ve
got a product-market fit, just because they’ve raised funding. They're wrong,
why do you think 70% of startups that raised Series A still fail, because the
no.1 reason was lack of PMF!

**You have it ...**

On a high level, you've found product market fit when you can repeatably
acquire customers for a lower cost (CAC) than what they are worth (LTV) to
you.

\- Elizabeth Yin

“You can always feel when Product/Market Fit is happening. The customers are
buying the product just as fast as you can make it - or usage is growing just
as fast as you can add more servers. Money from customers is piling up in your
company's account.

[](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/)Image Source: David Rusenko, Weebly

You’re hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can. Reporters
are calling because they’ve heard about your hot new thing and they want to
talk to you about it.” - [Marc
Andreessen](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html)

When product-market fit occurs something magical happens, all of a sudden your
customers become your salespeople i.e. they sell for you. - Josh Porter.

Few days back, one of founder send me DM asking what can fundraising founders
do to increase their chances of getting a meeting? Here are 4 things you can
follow to increase your odds of landing a meeting with a VC:

**1\. Keep it short**

Most investors are constantly on the go, checking email on their phone between
meetings.  

They likely won’t have time to read a 5-paragraph essay that outlines your
company’s mission, business model, value prop, fundraising goals, and
traction.  

My recommendations:

  * Include one sentence about the problem you're solving + your solution

  * Use a few bullet points to indicate the value prop, pilots, and/or traction

  * End with a clear call to action, like “Do you have time for a 15-minute call to talk about fundraising?”

**2\. Get a warm intro**

Investors are 93% more likely to take a meeting with someone who has been  
recommended to them.  

But not everyone has a second-degree connection to an investor. So, how do you
make a warm intro out of thin air?  

One tactic is to reach out to one of the investor’s portfolio company CEOs.  

Start by introducing yourself to the CEO and asking for their advice on
something startup-related (see #1 for tips on getting a response).  

Then, once you’ve developed a relationship with her, ask the CEO for an intro
to their investors.  

When an investor gets an introduction to an emerging startup from one of their
star CEOs, they’re more likely to take you seriously.

**3\. Do your research**

VCs often tailor their investments around a certain type of business. Their
focus could be an industry (VR vs. marketplaces), founder profile (female
founders vs. founders in a specific region), or size (pre-seed vs. Series A).  

Many VCs won’t take the time to respond to emails from startups that aren’t in
their sweet spot, let alone take a meeting with them.  

As one investor told me, “I’m far more likely to book a meeting from a cold
email that seems like it could be a good fit for my firm’s mandate than I am
to book a meeting from a warm intro to a company that isn’t a fit.”

**4\. Reduce Your Red Flags**

VCs assess startups quickly to decide if a meeting is worth their time.
Certain red flags can make them pass instantly:

  * The founder isn’t working on the business full-time.

  * The revenue model relies entirely on ads.

  * The team appears distracted by multiple projects instead of focusing on the core business.

  * A similar company is already in their portfolio.

  * The startup requires massive funding just to launch an MVP.

  * The valuation is unrealistically high.

These red flags vary from fund to fund. Do your research (see tip #3) to
understand what different VCs consider deal breakers.

##### **THIS WEEK’S NEWS RECAP**

  * President Trump urged Republican lawmakers [to eliminate](https://venturedailydigest.beehiiv.com/p/openai-s-ex-cto-mira-murati-hires-openai-cofounder-apple-s-new-iphone-se-might-be-announced-next-wee-0062#:~:text=Trump%20pushes%20to%20end%20carried%20interest%20tax%20break%2C%20VC%20industry%20pushes%20back%3A)**[](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/carried-interest-repeal-could-stifle-investments-in-startups-nvca-says/)** the carried interest tax break, which allows private equity and venture fund managers to pay lower capital gains tax rates on investment earnings.
