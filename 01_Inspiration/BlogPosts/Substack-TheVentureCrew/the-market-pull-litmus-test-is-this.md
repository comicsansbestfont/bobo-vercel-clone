##### **📜 DEEP DIVE**

A startup can look like it’s working long before it is.

You launch a product. You get 500 signups. A few people say they “love it.”
One person even tweets about it. It feels like validation. But is it?

The hard truth is: [most early signs of traction are
noise](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/168843611/the-startup-metrics-
that-fool-everyone). Not because they’re fake, but because they don’t always
mean what we think they do.

As a founder, your job isn’t just to build something and get it in front of
people. It’s to listen for pull, to spot when the market is pulling you
forward, not just reacting politely.

Because founders who chase pull build real companies. Founders who chase hype?
They burn out.

**Market pull vs. market push: why it matters**

  * **Push** is when you have to constantly follow up, pitch, explain, and convince people to try your product. Most of the energy is coming from you.

  * **Pull** is when people ask to try your product. They return without reminders. They want to pay before you’re even ready. They show up because the problem is real, and the solution clicks.

> A pull-based startup feels like the market is helping you build. People
> complain when you ship slowly. They send feedback without you asking.
>
> They invite others. And the product spreads, even when it’s rough around the
> edges.

If you’re in push mode for too long, you’re likely building something nice-to-
have, not need-to-have.

**What does pull look like in the real world**

You know you’re seeing pull when:

  * People keep using your product even when it’s broken.

  * New users who signed up that you didn’t directly pitch or advertise to.

  * Users are coming back unprompted, no email reminders needed.

  * People ask when they can start paying.

  * Customers are actively referring it to teammates or friends.

Push is fueled by effort. Pull is fueled by pain. If the pain is real, people
will chase your solution even when it's imperfect.

**Examples of pull-driven companies**

**Loom’s** breakout came from a simple screen recorder Chrome extension. It
didn’t need explanation.

It immediately solved the pain of communicating async in remote teams. That’s
why 3,000 people signed up on Day 1, with no marketing spend.

**Figma** Designers were already frustrated with offline tools and messy
handoffs. Figma made collaboration real-time. That was the unlock. Product
teams adopted it naturally, without paid growth. It spread because it was the
solution people had been waiting for.

**Notion** didn’t just build a note-taking app. It gave power users building
blocks. Those users started creating templates, building a community, and
sharing them widely. Users didn’t just use the product; they amplified it.

**The Market Pull Validation Ladder:**

Here’s a 6-step framework to assess how close you are to real market pull:

  1. **Are people complaining about this problem without being prompted?**

Check Reddit, Slack groups, forums, and support tickets. If the pain is
visible already, that’s a green light.

  2. **Do people lean in when you describe the product?**

The right idea feels instantly obvious to the right person. No need for 3
slides and 4 metaphors. If they say, “That’s interesting,” it’s not enough.
You want, “Oh wow, I need this.”

  3. **Are users coming back without you reminding them?**

This is one of the strongest signals. If retention is organic, not driven by
drip emails and coupons, you’ve built something sticky.

  5. **Will users pay even when the product is rough?**

Put up a paywall. Add a $10 plan. Watch what happens. If people pay early, it
means the value is clear. Pricing is a forcing function.

  6. **Are people bringing others in without being told to?**

Referrals, invites, and organic sharing are the ultimate signs of product-
market fit. That’s not marketing. That’s pull.

The more you climb this ladder, the clearer it becomes whether you’re building
a product or a business.

  * **What to do if you’re not seeing pull yet -** It doesn’t mean the idea is bad. It just means you’re not there yet. So here’s what to do:

  * **Talk to your users again, but better**. Ask about what they currently use, where they’re frustrated, and what they’ve already tried to fix it.

  * **Go narrower**. Focus on the highest-pain segment. Find your 100 true fans, not the next 10,000.

  * **Rework your positioning**. Is your landing page confusing? Is your product solving what it says it solves?

  * **Charge early**. Money changes behaviour. Free users might tinker. Paid users give you sharper feedback.

  * **Change the use case, not the product**. Sometimes, the solution is right, but you’re aiming it at the wrong pain.

I often see founders focus on:

  * Viral videos

  * Waitlists from giveaways

  * Social media impressions

But investors, advisors, and smart operators know to focus on:

  * Day 7 and Day 30 retention

  * Actual usage of core features

  * Organic growth and repeat usage

  * Willingness to pay

##### **TOOL FOR FOUNDERS**

frameworks.

your startup’s worth and talk numbers with confidence.

**✅ What’s inside:**

  * 7 proven valuation methods (VC Method, Scorecard, DCF & more)

  * A step-by-step framework to pick the right one

  * Real investor benchmarks + Excel templates

  * How to present your valuation in your pitch deck

Built by VCs and founders who’ve raised money. No jargon. No fluff. Just
clarity.

##### **📄 QUICK WIN**

Why do people check Duolingo daily? Why can’t we stop scrolling TikTok? It's
not magic, it’s design.

Nir Eyal’s Hook Model shows how the best products turn casual users into loyal
ones by building habit loops into the core experience. If you are looking to
build such a product, you can practically apply this model intro your product
and see great results.

> Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment

Here’s how it works and how real startups apply it:

  * **Trigger** : A notification, emotion, or itch that brings users back. (Think: Duolingo’s daily reminder or TikTok’s FOMO-driven alerts.)

  * **Action** : The simplest behaviour in anticipation of a reward. Open app, swipe, tap. The easier, the better.

  * **Variable reward** : Keep it fresh. Offer social validation (likes), content discovery (TikTok), or surprise deals (shopping apps). Unpredictability builds curiosity.

  * **Investment** : Users put something in, time, effort, content, and data. That makes them more likely to come back. Every pin saved, playlist created, or streak maintained increases their emotional “buy-in.”

A few real-world examples:

  * **Netflix** : Personalised recommendations → 1-click play → binge-worthy content → more watch history = better suggestions.

  * **Flo Health** : Daily tracking → quick log action → personalised cycle insights → builds trust through stored health data.

  * **Duolingo** : Push notification → lesson tap → XP + streaks → user keeps coming back to avoid breaking progress.

Why this matters:

  * Great founders don’t just build features. They design behaviour.

  * If your product has high retention and repeat usage baked in, growth gets easier and CAC gets lower.

  * And here’s the kicker: internal triggers (like boredom or anxiety) eventually replace the external ones, and users come back on their own.

That’s the real power of the Hook Model: it helps you design products that
people want to return to, not because of hacks or tricks, but because it
becomes part of their routine.

But it’s not just about engagement for engagement’s sake. The best products
that use this model solve real problems and create real value, again and
again.

If you're building something people should use daily, build the loop that
makes it stick.

Founders often celebrate new MRR. But here’s the harsh truth: Your company
will stop growing sooner than you think.

Even if you’re consistently adding new revenue each month, you’ll eventually
hit a ceiling, and most don’t realise it until they stall out. That ceiling is
predicted by a powerful, underrated metric:

> → Max MRR = New MRR ÷ Churn Rate

Let’s say you’re adding $1,000 in new MRR each month, and your churn is 5%.

Your Max MRR is: $1,000 ÷ 0.05 = $20,000.

That means, even with a steady stream of new customers, your revenue will
flatline at $20K MRR.

Why? Because churn grows with your base. At 5%, the bigger your MRR gets, the
more you lose each month, until it cancels out your gains.

**Why it matters:**

  * It’s predictive. Max MRR tells you where your revenue is headed, not where it is.

  * It’s visceral. Unlike Quick Ratio or NRR, this gives you a hard cap to aim at or break through.

  * It explains stagnation. If you’re adding new customers but not growing? This is why.

**Case study: Buffer**

([Buffer](https://buffer.com/) \- A popular social media queuing tool)

Buffer’s public data showed this clearly:

  * Even during flat or declining revenue periods, they were still adding new MRR.

  * But because churn was too high (6–8%), that growth was cancelled out.

  * Only when they improved retention and reset pricing did their Max MRR curve spike, and revenue followed.

**What you should do:**

  1. Calculate your Max MRR monthly. It's as simple as:  
`Max MRR = New MRR this month ÷ current churn rate`

  2. Track how it changes. If it's not rising, you're not building a scalable engine.

  3. Fix churn first. Cutting churn from 6% to 3% doubles your growth ceiling.

  4. Then layer on growth. With churn low, more of your new MRR compounds.

This one metric can change how you prioritise everything, from roadmap to
pricing to onboarding.
