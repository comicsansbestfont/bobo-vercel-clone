##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

**Our controversial take:** A great fundraising process is only 20% about
pitching.

The other 80% is all about organization.

Yep, you heard that right.

Your pitch, the thing you’ve spent weeks refining and rehearsing, is only a
small part of successful fundraising.

_“What the heck do y’all mean by the organization?”_ \- you, probably

If you’re talking to dozens (or even hundreds) of investors, keeping track of
who they are, what stage they’re at, and what you last discussed is impossible
to do from memory. That’s where an investor CRM (Customer Relationship
Management) system comes in.

Some founders use tools like HubSpot, Salesforce, or Pipedrive, but you don’t
need fancy software. A simple Google Sheet can do the job. What matters is
that it helps you track key details, follow-ups, and next steps—so no
potential investor falls through the cracks.

**Walking through an investor CRM**

This spreadsheet may look like a lot at first. But a CRM is way simpler than
you might think.

**Basic contact info**

To kick things off, add the names and email addresses of the investors that
you already know.

Then add the names and email addresses of prospective investors that you would
like to build stronger relationships with.

**Type of Investor**

In the next column, label what type of investor they are (angel investor,
venture fund, etc). This will help you tailor your messaging accordingly.

**Referrer**

The **referrer** is the person who introduced you to the investor listed in
your CRM.

So if ABC sent an email to introduce me to an investor, ABC is the referrer in
this example?  

This is crucial because your team can see where your leads are coming from.
Plus if the introduction is a mutually beneficial one, we get a chance to
reach out to the referrer again to say thanks.

Add their names in the next column and let’s keep moving.

**Stage**

What stage are they at in terms of considering an investment in your company?

These stages can be customized to your situation… but for simplicity, let’s
define the stages that most funds used during our fundraising process.

  * **Lead** – When someone offers to refer somebody new to you but you haven’t made contact yet.

  * **First Contact** – This stage is the first time you both have been able to officially engage. Someone might have sent an email introduction and they may have reciprocated back saying, _“Yes, let’s meet!”_

  * **First Pitch** – This is the first meeting you have with them to pitch your company. 

  * **Due Diligence** – This comes after the pitch when they’re considering investing. It’s normal for investors to ask to see more materials to help them make a decision.

  * **Soft Commit** – This is when they are interested in investing and have given you a dollar amount they want to put towards your company. This is purely a verbal commitment, nothing official, but a positive sign to move them into the next stage.

  * **Signed** – This is when the confetti drops from the ceiling because you have received a full commitment from this investor. Whooot!!! 🎊 

  * **Rejected and Ghosted** – These are the stages where they reject your pitch or never return your messages. But remember, it’s not over yet. There’s still an opportunity to maintain the relationship or even invite them to your [biweekly/monthly investors update](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/152011320/how-to-write-monthlybi-weekly-investors-updates-email-template). They may convert into investors down the road.

**Committed**

If they have given you a verbal commitment of a certain amount they want to
invest, include this number in the **Committed** column.

Above, you can see three investors committing a combined total of $300,000 as
an example.

**Notes**

The **Notes** section is the most critical part of the CRM.

It summarizes what you talked about during your calls or emails. Add as many
notes as you can along with the dates of each interaction.

These notes are crucial because fundraising is a team sport.

Tracking everything helps your team understand the context of the
relationship. So when they interact with this person, they know where each
investor is in the process, and can pick up right where their teammate left
off.

**Closed and Next Contact**

Next, we have a **Closed** column to show how much money you have closed.  

This is your time to celebrate your hard work being paid off. Launch the
confetti. Take out a bottle of champagne. You deserve it.  

Ok, time to get back to work. The last part of the CRM is a **Next Contact**
column. This is a reminder for yourself on when you should reach out to this
person again.  

So if you're still in the due diligence or soft commit phases, set a clear
date here on when you should follow up.  

If people have committed, we recommend getting aggressive and following up
every two or three days. This shows that you’re committed to making this work
and are certain you have given them all the materials they need to feel
unblocked on making a decision.  

For the people who have rejected or ghosted you, you should keep reaching out.  

Remember a rejection is never truly a rejection until you get a hard “no”.

So your investor CRM is a critical tool for successful fundraising.

  * All your contacts are in one place with detailed information

  * All the interactions your team has had with each person are tracked so everyone is on the same page

  * It tracks where everyone is in the fundraising process and gives reminders on when to follow up.

Start your investor CRM as soon as possible. Like, now.

There are paid CRM tools out there to track opens and clicks on emails. But to
keep things simple, we recommend starting with a basic spreadsheet.

Here’s [a template](https://theventurecrew.gumroad.com/l/investorcrm) you can
use for your fundraising journey.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Recently came across a [LinkedIn
post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mercedesbent_why-do-founders-get-ghosted-
by-vcs-generally-
activity-7282409128738570240-_5B3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADSZgeABxlwMnuq8n-_LND05e9NXan-
Jdvo) from LightSpeed Venture Partner on the same topic as the title. So
thought I to share some insights and how to handle this situation as a
founder.

**Why VCs Ghost Founders**

  1. Time Constraints – Investors prioritize high-potential startups. Writing rejections takes effort, so many don’t bother.

  2. Overload of Pitches – With thousands of pitches, some VCs use automation, while others ignore cold outreach altogether.

  3. Busy Schedules – Fundraising, portfolio support, and industry events often push deal responses down the priority list.

**Red Flags That Lead to Rejection**

  * Lack of Market Awareness – Investors expect founders to acknowledge risks and competitors.

  * Unrealistic Claims – Overpromising without proof turns off investors.

  * Weak Team Dynamics – Founding team tension or missing key skills raises concerns.

  * Dishonesty – Misrepresenting metrics or partnerships will get you blacklisted.

  * Negative Attitude – Speaking poorly of past investors or competitors is a red flag.

**How Founders Should Respond**

  * Follow Up Once or Twice, Then Move On – No response means no interest.

  * Seek Feedback Elsewhere – Other investors might provide clarity.

  * Build Real Relationships – Warm intros work better than cold emails.

  * Refine Your Pitch – If ghosting is frequent, rethink your positioning. You can even check out [Marc Andreessen's framework](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/marc-andreessen-when-vcs-say-no-and) on things to do when VCs say no. 

VC ghosting isn’t personal—it’s how the industry operates. Instead of chasing
silence, focus on building, networking, and finding investors who truly see
your vision.

Also if you are struggling to find the right investors, my team has built a
verified investor contact database covering the US, India, Africa, Australia,
and UK investors. You can check[ it out

deck storytelling, you can explore [our all-in-one guide

Most ideas, especially in B2C, get validated in one of four ways:

**[This framework](https://www.consumerstartups.com/p/idea-validation-
framework-backed?utm_source=houck.news&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=start-
with-a-small-market)** defines the differences between each path to
validation.

  1. **Signal Aggregation**

Founders should test an idea's viability through small experiments that
provide evidence (signals) of potential success before building a full
product. Common signals include landing page sign-ups, social media
engagement, ad click-through rates, and customer interview feedback.

  2. **Strong Beta**

Achieving strong early traction with a beta product is another popular
validation approach for founders. Success metrics vary across industries,
e.g., high user numbers and retention for consumer social apps, and healthy
revenue for B2C marketplaces.

The process typically starts with a hypothesis for solving a problem. The
founder builds a basic version to test the hypothesis. Beta products are often
rudimentary, lacking polish, due to the emphasis on speed over perfection.
This approach aligns with the lean methodology of launching quickly and
iterating based on feedback.

  3. **True Fans**

This approach is similar to the Strong Beta approach, as it involves launching
a beta product. However, instead of focusing on significant traction metrics
like revenue or user acquisition, the founder seeks to identify a small group
of fanatic users who deeply love the product despite its limited features. The
key is finding 20-50 users who would be disappointed if the product were to go
away. These passionate fans, rather than large user numbers, serve as the
validation signal.

  4. **Visionary**

This approach is the least common among the founders interviewed, as it
requires a clear vision and plan for the product from the outset. Typically,
the founder has a close personal connection to the problem being solved and a
strong understanding of what needs to be done to address it.

Yesterday, I received an email from a founder asking about equity
distribution. He is working full time, while his co-founder is only part-time,
and he wanted to know the best way to split equity in this situation.

I figured some of you might be in a similar position, so I’m sharing my
response here.

See, when you're building a company, equity in the business is a highly
valuable asset. In the early days, you don't have much (or any) revenue,
probably don't have a big audience, and may not even have a fully built-out
product yet.

Equity is the one thing you can offer to potential investors and employees.

(Friendly reminder that equity = ownership in the company. So if I have 25% of
the equity in your business, I own 25% of your company.)

It's super important that you don't give away too much equity in the business,
especially in the early days.

Partly because any equity you give away means that you (the founder) will have
less ownership over your own business. Equity will translate to dollars when
you IPO or get acquired, so you want to maintain enough equity to stay
motivated to keep working on the business.

But prospective investors also care deeply about how many people are on your
cap table. If you give a bunch of equity to someone who isn't working on the
business full-time, that's a bad look. It means there will be less room on
your cap table for more strategic partners.

It's best to save that equity and allocate it to people who can meaningfully
help push the business forward -- like investors (through capital and
strategic help), key employees, etc.

Now, back to the question. If you have a co-founder who is not working full-
time on the business, it doesn't make sense to give this person a ton of
equity in the business because they aren't 100% focused on the success and
growth of the company.

We view part-time co-founders as akin to an active advisor. Therefore, I
recommend allocating equity in the 2-15% range.

  * 15% would be _incredibly_ generous

  * Super active, hands-on advisors are typically granted < 5%

  * Non-active advisors are typically granted < 1%

  * Former co-founders who have contributed about 1-2 years typically end up with ~10-15% equity since they didn’t vest their full potential.

That’s it.
