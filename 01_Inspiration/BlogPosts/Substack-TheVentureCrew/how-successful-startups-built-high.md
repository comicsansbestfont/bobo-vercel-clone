##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

Every founder gets excited when the waitlist grows. A thousand signups. Ten
thousand. But unless those people convert, you’ve just collected names, not
demand.

Last week, I wrote about [what makes a good waitlist conversion
rate](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/160562677/what-is-a-good-waitlist-
conversion-rate-and-how-to-increase-yours). The numbers were clear: most
waitlists convert under 5%. That’s not traction. That’s noise. The difference
between a dead waitlist and one that fuels real growth comes down to
execution, structure, messaging, follow-up, and intent.

So I want to show you how some of the most product-savvy startups used their
waitlists as growth engines. The one thing that is common among all startups
is that they understand that a waitlist is not a landing page; it’s the first
product experience.

**Superhuman: Build desire before access**

Superhuman had a waitlist of over 180,000 people before launch.

Instead of onboarding in bulk, they handpicked users. One by one. Every early
user had to go through a short application and a 30-minute onboarding call.
They weren’t just collecting signups. They were training evangelists.

Why it worked:

  * The onboarding call wasn’t just about setup; it was used to qualify, personalise, and close.

  * They used social proof and exclusivity. Users felt like they earned their seat.

  * Friends could invite others, but those referrals went to the _top_ of the queue. That turned existing users into distributors.

It was slow. Deliberate. But it built demand. And when they did open up
access, people were willing to pay $30/month, because they had been primed for
value.

**Arc Browser: Curate your early community**

Arc didn’t go viral because of hype. It grew because they understood which
users mattered early on and gave them a reason to care.

Their waitlist focused on PMs, designers, and early tech power users. The
onboarding wasn’t automated. It was intentional. If you were in their target
persona, you got access early. If not, you waited.

And while you waited? They stayed top of mind. Early users shared demos.
YouTube creators reviewed private builds. Twitter was filled with people
asking for invites. They turned their beta group into marketing.

  * Don’t open access too early. Quality over quantity.

  * Use content and community to keep people engaged while they wait.

  * Let the right people in first, not just the loudest.

Arc only dropped the waitlist once they hit v1.0. Until then, every access
point was earned. That built loyalty and word-of-mouth.

**Clubhouse: Manufacture FOMO with exclusivity**

Clubhouse was the masterclass in waitlist-driven hype. You couldn’t join
without an invite. Every time someone did get in, the app made it obvious,
triggering notifications to friends, showing conversations, and sparking
curiosity.

It felt like a secret club. You wanted in because you were left out.

Their growth didn’t come from paid ads or launch campaigns. It came from:

  * Invite-only access that created social urgency

  * Scarcity-driven hype amplified by influencers and VCs

  * Network design that made new users more visible to their circles

People were bidding for invites. That’s the power of perceived access.

Lesson: Exclusivity doesn’t work for every product, but if your app is social,
communal, or time-based, a closed-door policy can be a marketing engine.

**Robinhood: Make the waitlist the product**

Robinhood’s launch playbook in 2014 became legendary. Their pre-launch site
didn’t just collect emails; it created a live leaderboard. Everyone could see
their position. Everyone could move up the queue by inviting friends.

The formula:

  * Sign up = join the waitlist

  * Invite 1 person = jump 100+ spots

  * Share more = get faster access

It gamified the process. It triggered urgency. And it worked.

They ended up with over 1 million users before launching.

You don’t need a fancy product to go viral. You need incentives. You need
urgency. You need to show users how they win by spreading the word.

**Dropbox: Reward referrals with product value**

Long before waitlists were trendy, Dropbox hacked growth through its referral
engine. When you signed up, you could earn more free storage by inviting
friends. Not only did it grow their list, but it also taught people the
product’s core value: cloud sharing.

The structure was simple:

It was the perfect flywheel: the waitlist spread the product, and the product
reinforced the value of spreading it.

Dropbox didn’t treat its waitlist as a launch strategy. They treated it as a
distribution channel.

If your product has clear, shareable valuebake that into your signup flow. Let
users market for you.

**What you can steal**

> Across all five, one pattern stands out: Great waitlists are designed like
> products. They create value before users log in. They spark emotion,
> curiosity, urgency, and exclusivity. And they move.

Here’s how to build one that converts:

  1. **Treat the waitlist like onboarding.**

Your product experience starts before someone signs in. If you make them feel
ignored or forgotten after signing up, you’ve already lost.

  2. **Use friction as a filter.**

Application forms. Manual approvals. These aren’t bugs, they’re features.
Scarcity builds desire. Make it feel like access has to be earned.

  3. **Engage before launch.**

People get cold when left alone. Send updates. Share product behind-the-
scenes. Show them progress. Make the wait feel like they’re part of something.

  4. **Make it move.**

Let users skip the line by referring others or engaging. Waitlists should feel
dynamic. Show them their position. Let them move up.

  5. **Start small. Learn fast.**

Don’t try to manage 10,000 people. Start with 100 who are the right fit. Talk
to them. Onboard them. Learn what converts and what doesn’t.

Remember, a waitlist is the beginning of the user journey. Superhuman made
people wait, but kept them warm. Robinhood made it a game. Dropbox made it
rewarding. Clubhouse made it elite. Arc made it intentional.

Don’t collect emails. Build anticipation. Design a journey. Because when it’s
done right, the waitlist doesn’t just lead to growth, it becomes the growth.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

When you’re building a startup, no one hands you the folder, one with all the
stuff you need.

  * Investor lists that work. 

  * Financial models that make sense.

  * Legal docs that don’t cost a fortune.

  * Templates that save hours.

So we built it ourselves with input from founders who've bootstrapped and
those who've raised millions, plus VCs who know what they’re looking for.

Here’s everything we’ve created (and keep improving):

You can explore them all[ here](https://theventurecrew.gumroad.com/)..

Every time a new platform emerges, we scramble to measure its impact. But
early on, it’s rarely clear what to measure or why it matters.

We saw this with the early internet. In the 90s, people tracked things like
“internet hosts” or “hits”, which just counted how many files your browser
downloaded from a web server. More GIFs meant more hits. Not exactly
insightful.

Then came the smartphone wave, and the confusion shifted to installed base vs.
unit sales vs. ARPU.

Social media added its evolution: first it was “registered users,” then MAU,
then DAU/MAU ratios. Each wave had its metrics, often chosen to make a company
look good, not to reflect actual value.

We’re at that same messy phase with generative AI.

Benedict Evans recently [broke this down](https://www.ben-
evans.com/benedictevans/2025/6/9/generative-ais-metrics-question) brilliantly.
He pointed out that many of today’s AI metrics sound impressive but don’t tell
us much.

Even when the numbers are specific, they often lack clarity:

  * If a model becomes more efficient, the same task needs fewer tokens, so are we seeing a drop in usage or just better technology?

  * On the flip side, agents and media tools burn more tokens per request, so growth might reflect heavier workloads, not more users.

And we’re still guessing at what generative AI will become. That makes
choosing the “right” metric nearly impossible.

> Will it mostly remain as user-facing chatbots? Or will it quietly integrate
> into everything, like SQL or cloud compute?

If it becomes infrastructure used everywhere but rarely seen, then asking “how
many people use AI?” is as pointless as asking “how often do you use a
database?”

So what should we be tracking?

  * **Engagement quality** – not just logins, but how deep and meaningful the interaction is.

  * **Retention over time** – are people coming back, and are they using it more meaningfully?

  * **Task replacement** – what jobs or workflows are users abandoning in favor of AI tools?

  * **Behavioural feedback** – are people satisfied on the first try, or do they constantly?

  * **Enterprise integration depth** – is it casual use by the marketing team or core to ops?

Other things like how companies like Google and Meta measure deeper signals:
reformulated searches, bounce rates, completion behaviour. These are second
and third-order indicators that show what’s working, and they often feed back
into making the product better.

Right now, generative AI lacks those feedback loops. If you ask an LLM a
question and don’t try again, was the answer perfect? Or did you give up and
switch to Google? No one can tell.

At the end of the day, all metrics eventually resolve to money and time.
That’s where clarity will come from, only once we know what generative AI is
truly for. Until then, we’re still counting hits.

evans.com/benedictevans/2025/6/9/generative-ais-metrics-question).

Every fast-growing startup eventually hits this point: the growth engine that
once seemed unstoppable starts to slow down. The acquisition loop that got you
here, whether SEO, paid ads, virality, or sales, just isn’t moving the numbers
like it used to.

You try optimisations. Run experiments. Nothing breaks through.

So what's next?

[Casey Winters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseywinters/), cofounder of
Superside and former growth leader at Pinterest and Grubhub, [breaks this
down](https://caseyaccidental.substack.com/p/when-growth-plateaus-how-and-
when) with clarity: when growth plateaus, it’s tempting to chase new
acquisition channels. But most of the time, that’s not the real answer.

Startups often think they just “missed a channel” and need to add paid ads or
launch a sales team. But that’s rarely true. Your original channel worked for
a reason; it was the most viable option at your stage. New channels only
become viable when something fundamental in the business changes.

  * **Virality** scales when users share the product because it makes them look smart (like Notion), earns them money (like Dropbox), or adds value when their friends join (like WhatsApp). But virality fades, and what’s exceptional quickly becomes normal.

  * **Sales** work when you have a high enough LTV to support commission, and leads are easy to find. But it’s not plug-and-play. If your payback period is weak, this channel breaks.

  * **Paid acquisition** requires great retention and monetisation. The best customers get targeted first. After that, it gets harder and more expensive. You need strong LTV or a network effect to offset that decay.

  * **Content** channels like SEO or user sharing work best when users generate the content. Company-created content rarely scales. Content loops are long games, not quick wins.

From the outside, adding new channels looks like growth. But from the inside,
the reality is more nuanced.

You don’t “find” breakout channels. You earn them by improving unit economics,
deepening retention, or growing your product surface.

When Casey led growth at Grubhub, they didn’t just tack on SEO or TV ads from
day one. Those came after restaurant supply grew, user behaviour improved, and
conversion economics got stronger.

In practice, that means asking questions like:

  * Has our LTV improved to the point where we can afford a longer payback period?

  * Do we now have enough user-generated content to fuel SEO or social?

  * Has our product bundle changed enough to justify new messaging or outreach?

  * Have engagement loops meaningfully lifted retention or usage?

If the answer is no, then adding a new channel might give you a small bump,
maybe 5-10%, but not the next mountain of growth. And that’s a distraction.

In most cases, the harder path, strengthening the core product or unlocking
better monetisation, ends up being the more worthwhile investment than chasing
new channels too early.

You can layer on engagement tactics to lift lifetime value:

  * People-based support (concierge, onboarding teams)

  * Product tweaks (features that increase daily utility)

  * Incentives (discounts, gamification, loyalty)

  * Messaging (email, push, reactivation campaigns)

But these are multipliers, not foundations. If your product doesn’t deliver
recurring value, no amount of nudges will change the curve meaningfully.

Plateaus aren’t signs you’ve failed; they’re checkpoints. And the smartest
founders don’t respond by throwing more at the wall. They zoom out, ask what’s
truly changed, and only then commit to new loops.

Because new channels don’t work unless you’ve earned them. And you earn them
by building something that holds attention, creates value over time, and gets
better the more it’s used.

That’s when you’re ready for the next phase.
