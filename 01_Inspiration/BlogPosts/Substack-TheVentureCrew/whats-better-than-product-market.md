> As a founder, you always hear everyone talking about achieving product-
> market fit for a startup, but I think the key is to achieve product-market-
> channel Fit. But why? Let’s deep dive into it.

The fact is that having a **great product is useless unless you also have the
right channels to sell** it through. This is particularly true with some sorts
of businesses — a winery, for example, will never get to scale unless the
product is carried by one of the large distributors (with alcohol, the 3-tier
distribution system is actually mandated by law). Medical products are also
controlled by a few large distributors. Or if you’re a startup selling a
mobile app, your distribution relies completely on the iOS and Android app
stores. You’ll never make it if you don’t optimize your presence in that sales
channel.

`Startup with better distribution usually beat a better product so investing
early in sales and marketing will help you achieve your business goals.`

Today, of course, many companies sell directly online instead of through
traditional resellers or retail stores. And yet distribution still matters —
putting your product on Amazon will get you 1,000 the distribution you could
ever get on your own standalone website. And Amazon charges a toll for that.

So all of this really boils down to the one equation: CAC < LTV ([Customer
Acquisition Cost < Life Time
Value](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/cac-ltv-
ratio/)). If you don’t have efficient distribution then your Customer
Acquisition Cost will be too high. And if you have to pay a toll in order to
get distribution then the Lifetime Value of a customer will be lower. But
Distribution ain’t cheap.

If you are aware of this - [Apple decided to stop selling through
retailers](https://www.quora.com/Do-you-know-how-Apple-stops-selling-the-old-
model-in-stores-and-online-after-the-new-model-comes-out-What-happens-to-the-
left-over-stock-since-they-dont-sell-in-Apple-Stores) and open their own
branded stores instead. It was a dicey move because they were giving up the
distribution of Best Buy, Circuit City, and all the rest.

But Steve Jobs said, “We sell a premium product and we need to take control of
the customer experience in order to get the premium price”. So in essence he
went from a low-cost low-margin distribution model to a high-cost high-margin
distribution model. And this decision worked out really well.

**Licensing can also be a way to get distribution.** A famous case study from
history is consumer videotape systems. Betamax, owned by Sony, was the
superior product. But VHS, the competitive system owned by JVC, ended up
winning because JVC got distribution by licensing VHS to all the other
companies making video players. One of the examples is when Google first
released the Android operating system, Apple had a big lead with iOS. Google
decided to distribute Android by licensing it to other smartphone companies
(so that Google would get the search traffic). Today the worldwide market
share is 73% Android and 27% iOS. Distribution matters.

The point of all this is that while entrepreneurs are working hard to get
Product/Market Fit, they should also be experimenting with various
distribution channels. The laws of economics say that your startup will fail
if you don’t get to CAC < LTV, and ultimately the driver for that is
Product/Market/Channel Fit.

I hope this will help you to get some new ideas and what’s better to focus on
- PMF Or PMDF. What do you think?

Recently I came across an amazing article on negotiating valuation with
investors. I observe that most of the time founders face this problem while
negotiating valuation numbers for their startups. So, I am sharing some tips
from that article -

**Strategic Pricing in Negotiations:**

The initial price you propose during negotiations, whether you're a buyer or
seller, carries significant weight. It can establish the framework for the
entire discussion. Hence, it's crucial to approach this step with a clear
understanding of your startup's true value. Setting the bar too low might lead
to undervaluing your business while starting too high could create resistance
and hinder productive negotiations.

**Leveraging Alternatives for Negotiation:**

The presence of alternative investors or funding sources provides a powerful
bargaining chip when negotiating your startup's valuation. This competitive
advantage allows you to explore multiple options, compare offers, and
ultimately secure the most favourable terms for your business. However, it's
essential to have these alternatives in place before the negotiation process
begins to maximize their effectiveness.

**Valuations' Real Benefits:**

Conducting early valuations for your startup offers a multitude of advantages.
It precisely assesses your company's assets, enabling informed decisions about
insurance coverage and necessary investments. Moreover, it establishes a
realistic understanding of your business's market value, particularly valuable
if you plan to sell in the future. Eliminating guesswork, valuations showcase
growth over time, attracting potential investors and demonstrating your
competence in running the business.

**In-depth knowledge is Key:**

Deep comprehension of your startup's value serves as the cornerstone of
successful negotiations. Being well-prepared with a comprehensive
understanding not only prevents you from undervaluing your business but also
instils confidence in investors or buyers. However, it's essential to remember
that while valuation is pivotal, the terms of the investment can significantly
impact the overall deal.

**Conclusion**

Recognizing the worth of your startup is pivotal in negotiation scenarios.
Thorough preparation, backed by comprehensive knowledge, equips you to
navigate these discussions effectively. Remember that both valuation and
investment terms play crucial roles in shaping the outcome of these
negotiations.
