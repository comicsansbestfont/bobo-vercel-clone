##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

You know that awkward “it’s kind of working” phase? Where the product’s not
failing, but it’s not taking off either? Where every dashboard sort of shows
progress, but nothing feels definitive?

Rob Go shared an insightful mental model (In 2016, still relevant today) for
exactly this phase the shape of traction before product-market fit and it’s
one every founder should understand.

Here’s the breakdown and my thoughts on this:

Most early-stage founders believe that the more you improve your product, the
more traction you’ll get. And that sounds reasonable. If the product gets
better, more people should use it, right?

In theory, this would show up as a straight line on a graph product quality on
the X-axis, traction on the Y-axis.

But that’s not what happens in real life.

The actual shape of traction, especially before product-market fit, is more
like an S-curve. In the beginning, you make improvements but only see a modest
bump in traction. Then, if you’re on the right path, things suddenly start to
click traction accelerates quickly.

Eventually, growth levels off again once you hit saturation or diminishing
returns. But the tricky part is the beginning, before the curve bends upward.
That flat part is what traps so many teams.

The most dangerous part? You can squint and convince yourself that progress is
happening. That you’re close.

That one more feature or one more marketing push will tip the balance. You see
a few signs of life users using the product, some positive feedback, maybe a
handful of sales and you convince yourself PMF is just around the corner.

But what if it’s not?

Two common founder misreads often make this phase even more confusing.

First, many founders overestimate how polished or “complete” the product needs
to be to generate traction. It’s incredible how often raw, even borderline
broken tools get early love, if they’re solving something people truly care
about. Founders worry too much about perfection. But real early adoption often
happens in spite of flaws. If the pain is real, and your solution is fresh,
people will use it.

Second, founders often underestimate how obvious it becomes when things start
working. When you actually hit product-market fit, everything moves. Usage
grows fast. Word-of-mouth spreads. Customers convert quickly. Money shows up
in your Stripe account. You're hiring support and sales people just to keep
up. It's not subtle. It doesn't require interpretation. You know it's
happening. So if you’re sitting there wondering if you’re close to PMF,
chances are, you’re probably not.

And that brings us to a better mental model. Most founders imagine they’re
slowly climbing one S-curve and just need to keep going. But Rob suggests
flipping the X-axis from product quality to time.

Because what actually happens for most companies is that you try one curve, it
flattens, and then you jump to another. Each curve represents a new product
idea, a new target audience, a repositioning, or a fresh attempt at traction.
This isn’t about making slow steady progress on a single path. It’s about
running experiments, resetting, and switching tracks until something clicks.

The takeaway here is critical: traction doesn’t usually happen on a continuous
line it comes after a series of pivots, retries, and sharp learning loops.

So how should you navigate this phase if you’re still pre-PMF?

  * First, shorten the feedback loop. Don’t wait months to know if something is working. Run faster experiments. Measure quickly. Decide faster. Speed is your advantage here.

  * Second, stay lean. A large team increases burn and slows learning. It also makes it harder to pivot when you need to. You might have the money to hire fast — but don’t. Before PMF, you want focus, not scale.

  * Third, don’t stick to incremental changes if the curve is flat. If your current direction isn’t working, don’t keep tweaking the surface. Consider radical shifts a different customer segment, new pricing, a reworked core feature. Sometimes what you need isn’t polish it’s a reset.

  * Fourth, raise accordingly. If you haven’t found PMF, don’t raise with a mindset of scaling. Raise with the goal of learning. You’re not building a company yet you’re still finding out what kind of company to build.

This way of thinking is especially helpful for teams still figuring out their
first real product-market fit. Everything that comes after scaling, hiring,
optimizing plays out differently. But in the early days, the shape of traction
is one of the few honest signals you have. It tells you where you actually
are, not just where you _want_ to be.

And the truth is, it’s often the rough, simple products that spark the
strongest reactions. When you finally land on something that really works, you
won’t have to overanalyze it. You’ll just know. It shows up in your users,
your numbers, your gut.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

For 20+ years, if you wanted people to find your company online, you learned
the rules of SEO: keywords, backlinks, rankings. You played the Google game.
And that worked, until now.

In 2025, the game is changing. Fast.

Search isn’t happening on browsers the way it used to. It’s happening inside
models. People are asking ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity instead of Google.
Apple is baking AI-native search into Safari. That’s a tectonic shift.

And with it comes a new playbook: Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO).

> SEO helped you rank.  
> GEO helps you get remembered.

Classic SEO was about getting on the first page of search results. GEO is
about getting mentioned in the answer itself, the paragraph ChatGPT gives your
potential customer when they ask, “What’s the best waterproof winter jacket?”

In that response, is your brand even mentioned? If not, you're invisible.

Where SEO is optimised for Google’s algorithm, GEO is optimised for how LLMs
think, how they synthesise, cite, and share information from across the
internet.

**LLMs don’t list. They reason. They remember. They compress.** So instead of
fighting to rank on page one, you’re now fighting to become part of the
model’s memory.

This isn’t about hacks or stuffing keywords. It’s about building content and
presence that earns you a place in the AI layer.

And here’s where the model era is different:

  * LLMs are paywalled, not ad-driven.

  * They’re personalised, not one-size-fits-all.

  * They summarise, not paginate.

That means brands need to think differently. You’re not bidding for ad slots
or traffic. You’re trying to become a trusted reference, something the model
brings up organically because you’re seen as legit.

You want to be cited by the model. That means:

  * Creating dense, well-structured content that models can parse.

  * Using summary formats, bullet points, and context-rich explanations.

  * Being referenced in authoritative sources and public knowledge bases.

This is about model relevance, not search rank.

We’re seeing the rise of platforms like Profound, Daydream, and Goodie that
help brands understand how they’re showing up in model outputs and why.

Some startups are even fine-tuning their own mini-LLMs to simulate how major
models think, allowing them to test prompts at scale and adjust content
strategy accordingly.

Canada Goose did this. They weren’t just looking at traffic. They wanted to
know:

> “Does the model think of us when someone asks about premium winter jackets?”

That’s the new game: unaided model awareness.

You don’t need 10 blue links anymore. You need one line in the AI’s answer.

New metrics are emerging:

  * Reference Rate: how often you’re cited by LLMs.

  * Sentiment Memory: how you’re framed in model outputs.

  * Competitive Share of Voice in AI-generated responses.

This is SEO 2.0 but deeper, more dynamic, and closer to the conversion moment.

For founders and growth teams, GEO is a first-mover opportunity.

Just like Adwords in 2003 or Facebook targeting in 2013, this is a new
channel. The difference? The channel is the model.

And the model is becoming the new front door to commerce. If your startup
isn’t present there, if the model doesn’t remember you, you’re not just
missing traffic. You’re missing trust.

The startups that win will:

  * Understand how to create GEO-friendly content

  * Use new tools to monitor model perception

  * Adapt quickly as LLM behaviour evolves

GEO isn’t static. Every model update may change the rules. Just like Google
updates used to wreck SEO rankings overnight, you’ll need to keep testing,
tracking, and iterating.

This isn’t just about visibility. GEO is a wedge into something bigger:

  * Real-time brand management inside LLMs

  * Autonomous marketing loops that optimise messaging daily

  * Full-stack platforms that own the loop from monitoring to creation to response

The companies that get this right won’t just sell insights. They’ll become the
channel itself.

Just like Shopify became more than a tool for e-commerce, the GEO winners will
become the system of record for _brand-model interaction_.

In a world where AI answers everything, the real question for your startup is:
“Will the model remember you?”

Because if it doesn’t, your next customer might not either.

Your pitch deck is tight. Your traction looks good. You're solving a real
problem. So why did that investor still say no? It’s not always because your
startup isn’t good enough. Often, it’s because you don’t fit their investment
thesis.

An investment thesis is a VC’s internal filter — their “rulebook” for deciding
what to fund.

Sometimes it’s formal (a PDF sent to LPs), other times it’s just an instinct
they’ve honed over years. But it always exists.

VCs use it to raise money from their limited partners (LPs). If they veer too
far off thesis, LPs get nervous. And nervous LPs mean no next fund.

**1\. Check size + round size**

**2\. Lead vs. follow**

  * Some VCs lead (set terms, take board seats).

  * Others follow (join after someone else leads).

  * Many don’t have bandwidth to lead too many deals.

**3\. Business model**

  * B2B: high-ticket sales to fewer customers

  * B2C: mass market, more users, smaller tickets

  * B2B2C: infra that powers someone else’s consumer play  
Misalignment here can end the conversation fast.

**4\. Vertical focus**

  * Some funds go deep in fintech, healthtech, AI, climate, etc.

  * Others avoid certain areas entirely (edtech, crypto, adtech, surveillance).  
You may be a great company — just in the wrong space for them.

**5\. Ownership targets**

**6\. Founder background**

  * Some funds back founders from certain alumni networks (e.g., Stanford, YC, ex-Stripe, etc.).

  * Some only invest in “underrepresented” founders by geography, race, gender, or background.

**7\. Geography**

  * Some invest only in the US.

  * Some only in Europe.

  * Some anywhere, but still prefer proximity. Yes, location still matters even in 2025.

**8\. Market size & return potential**

  * A $100M fund writing $5M checks expects _each_ company could return the full fund (i.e., become a $500M–$1B exit).

  * If your company looks like a solid 3x return but not a fund-returner, that’s a pass even if it’s a great business.

Before reaching out to any investors, check out their website, oftern time you
will find investmetn criteria on their website. If not then ask early.

A few simple questions can save you a lot of wasted time:

  * “What kinds of companies do you typically invest in?”

  * “Do we fit your thesis?”

  * “If not, is there one specific area where we don’t align?”

Founders often get rejected for the wrong reasons or worse, no reason at all.  
Sometimes it’s a misunderstanding. Sometimes you just don’t fit the filter.

But when you understand how investors think and how tightly they stick to
their thesis you can stop taking rejection personally… and start focusing on
the investors who can say yes.

Remember, even the best pitch can fall flat when it’s aimed at the wrong
target. So do your all research before reaching out to any investor.
