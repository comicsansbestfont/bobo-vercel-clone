##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

Founders often ask me these questions when raising a VC round:

  * How long does it take to negotiate a term sheet?

  * Who should start the valuation discussion the VC or the founder?

  * What are the top tips for negotiating a term sheet?

Getting a term sheet is a step toward closing your round but it’s not money in
the bank yet. Many founders don’t fully understand this and have a lot of
questions like the ones above. So I’m sharing this guide to walk you through
everything you need to know. After reading it, I’m confident most of your
doubts about term sheets will be gone.

**Let’s start with the basics what’s a term sheet?**  
A term sheet outlines the key terms and conditions of an investor’s offer to
invest in your startup.

Once an investor has done some initial due diligence and decides they want to
invest, they’ll usually send you a term sheet that looks something like this:

The term sheet includes a lot of terms that can feel overwhelming especially
for first-time founders. If you search online, you’ll find plenty of articles
explaining each one in depth. But to save you some time, I’ve listed the
**most important terms below** for quick reference:

  * Valuation Pre-money: Company's valuation before investment to determine equity split. Post-money: Company's valuation including the new investment capital.

  * Equity Common stock: Basic shares with voting rights but low priority in a liquidation. Preferred stock: Enhanced rights like priority in liquidation, and anti-dilution protection.

  * Liquidation Preference: Specifies the order in which shareholders get paid if the company is sold or goes bankrupt. Investors usually get paid back before founders/employees.

  * Vesting Schedule: The schedule over which founders/employees earn their equity over time, e.g. 4 years with a 1-year cliff.

  * Anti-Dilution: Protects investors by adjusting their price per share if the company raises money at a lower valuation in the future.

  * Board Representation: Who gets board seats - a mix of investors, founders, and independent directors.

  * Exit Strategy: IPO, acquisition, or merger provisions and the required shareholder approval for each path.

  * Confidentiality & Exclusivity: Can't share details. Startup can't talk to other investors for a set period.

  * Drag/Tag Rights Drag: Majorities can force minorities to join a company sale. Tag: Minorities can join a sale initiated by majorities.

  * Milestones & Tranching: Funding tied to startups achieving certain technical, revenue or other milestones.

that dives deep into term sheet terms, if you want to explore further. At its
core, a term sheet is all about alignment how founders and investors come
together and agree on key terms.

Now, most founders still have a few important questions, like:

“It shouldn’t take more than a week, or even just a few days, to negotiate a
term sheet. That is once a VC decides they truly want to do a deal. There
really aren’t many variables these days for seed to Series A deals, really
just price and how much you are raising/selling.

Most of the rest of the terms are much lower drama than they used to be. Most
VCs aren’t trying to control your board and your company in the early days
anymore. (If they do, that may take longer to work out).”

Founders also often ask me for tips on how to get the best deal one that’s not
just great on paper, but also actually closes. So here are a few things you
should keep in mind:

  * **Who goes first founder or VC** usually doesn’t matter in early-stage rounds. Some founders hold back, hoping to gain leverage by making a VC go first. But it’s cleaner to just ask directly: how much are you raising, and at what valuation?

  * **Leverage doesn’t come from going first**. It comes from having multiple offers, from being in demand, or simply not needing the money urgently. Running low on cash weakens your position. Having a solid alternative makes everything move faster.

  * **Asking for too much money can push a VC out** , even if they like you. Every firm has check size limits. If you’d take $3M but ask for $6M, and their cap is $3M, they may walk. Showing flexibility on round size, especially with smaller funds keeps doors open.

  * **If you're raising a large round, know that some VCs** will tap out early. For example, any founder raising $10M or more is outside what many seed investors can do. Even if the deal is good, it’s just too big for them.

  * **If you've raised more than usual for your stage** , don’t hide it. Address it upfront. $2M+ before early seed, $5M+ before pre-A, $10M+ before Series A those amounts are considered high. Be ready to show that existing investors are aligned on the current round’s pricing.

  * **If there's a past issue** like an ex-founder conflict disclose it. Don’t let it surface late in the process. The closer you get to a term sheet, the fewer surprises there should be.

  * **Ask what ownership target the VC has.** Most firms have a minimum they need to hit. In pre-seed it might be 2–7%, in Series A it’s often 15–20%. If your round doesn’t get them there, they’ll likely pass. Better to know early.

  * Decide in advance **how you feel about giving board seats**. Many VCs will ask if they’re buying 8% or more. Some won’t care, others will insist. Know your line and be upfront about it.

  * **Confidence is good** , but too much can come off as arrogance. VCs want to back ambitious founders but also ones who want a long-term partnership. If you don’t show any real interest in them, some will walk away.

  * **If you counter a VC’s offer** , listen closely to their response. Some leave wiggle room, others don’t. If you sense hesitation after you push on price, don’t keep pressing especially if it’s your top pick. VCs have internal limits, and they rarely forget when you try to push past them.

  * **Don’t waste energy on terms** that don’t move the needle. Registration rights, legal fee coverage, SAFEs vs equity these details won’t make or break the deal. Price, ownership, and control matter most. Focus there.

  * **Time can work in your favour** if you're growing fast. You might want to close quickly, but sometimes waiting a few months can strengthen your position. Growing from $20K to $50K MRR can dramatically change investor interest.

  * **Tight deadlines can create urgency,** but overplay it, and VCS may walk. Most can move fast when needed, but if the pressure feels forced, it can backfire. Be transparent about your timeline, and give space when you can.

  * **Make sure your existing investors** are aligned and supportive. If they’re quiet, unsure, or not reinvesting, that’s a red flag. But if they’re excited and joining the next round, it becomes much easier to close new capital.

There are also proven frameworks and strategies founders can use to negotiate
a term sheet the right way. If you want to go deeper, check out this [42-page

Even after successfully negotiating a term sheet, most founders forget to ask
key questions I always recommend before taking a VC’s money.

These questions reveal how a fund really operates behind the scenes and can
protect you from surprises later.

**1\. How are the GPs compensated?**

At most firms, the partner who brings in the deal gets the bulk of the profits
(carry). That means the rest of the partners aren’t financially motivated to
help you.

But in some funds like Benchmark or Hustle Fund carry is shared equally. This
structure encourages teamwork. Every partner is aligned to support you,
regardless of who sourced your deal.

If you want full access to a VC firm’s network, not just one person’s help,
understanding their internal incentives matters.

**2\. Where is the fund in its deployment cycle?**

Timing can impact your ability to raise follow-on capital. If you’re one of
the last investments in a fund that’s five or six years old, there may not be
money left for future rounds even if you’re doing well.

Newer funds = more dry powder.  
Older funds = limited reserves.

Always ask how much capital is left for follow-ons. Don’t just assume a
committed investor will be able to write a second check.

**3\. How quickly can they wire the money?**

It’s not uncommon for VCs especially newer ones to sign a term sheet before
they’ve raised their own capital. That can lead to long delays before money
hits your account.

Even with established funds, VCs often rely on capital calls. That means they
request money from their LPs after signing a deal and if LPs delay, so does
your wire.

Ask if they have funds already on hand, or if it will depend on a capital
call. Nail down the expected timing. Don’t risk missing payroll waiting on a
wire.

**Ask these early.**

These aren’t awkward questions. They show you’re thinking like a serious
founder who understands risk and wants real alignment from your investors.

Before you say yes to a term sheet, make sure you’re not just getting a check
— but a committed, functional partner who can deliver.

That’s it. If you have any other question regarding term sheet. feel free to

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

There’s no shortage of excitement around generative AI. Billions raised,
compute deals inked, and every software product suddenly has “Copilot”
stitched in. But underneath the momentum, there’s one uncomfortable question
few are asking out loud:

> Can any of these businesses actually make money?

Tech journalist Steven Vaughan-Nichols just [shared
](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3980239/will-genai-businesses-crash-
and-burn.html)something most people aren’t talking about: even the most
successful genAI companies are losing a lot of money and it’s starting to
show. So sharing a few notes and thoughts on this:

**1\. AI’s return on investment is still… underwhelming.**

In a recent IBM survey of 2,000 CEOs:

  * Only 25% of AI initiatives delivered expected ROI

  * Just 52% saw any value beyond cost-cutting

  * And 64% admit they’re investing mostly to avoid falling behind

So yeah, FOMO is still leading strategy more than fundamentals.

**2\. Even Microsoft’s Copilot is flatlining.**

Despite pushing Copilot into everything from Word to Excel, Microsoft’s
internal usage slide tells a different story:

> ~20 million weekly users and growth has flatlined.

Not exactly what you'd expect after pouring billions into the platform.

Even Satya Nadella recently admitted: “There is no killer app for AI.”

**3\. OpenAI’s $9B spend → $4B revenue.**

Yes, the poster child of genAI is scaling. But the economics? Brutal.

> OpenAI reportedly burned $9B in 2024 to make $4B in revenue, much of it
> spent on compute.

Tech critic Ed Zitron summarized it bluntly:

> “They lose money on every customer and hope to make it up in volume.”

**4\. The exception? GenAI with a narrow, clear use case.**

One company stood out in the analysis: Tempus AI, which uses genAI for
precision medicine. They grew revenue 75% YoY not by building generalized
tools, but by solving a specific, painful problem in a domain that pays for
results.

Lesson: the more abstract the promise, the longer the path to profits.

**5\. Nvidia is the only one cashing real checks.**

AI application companies might be struggling, but Nvidia?

> They’re selling the shovels in the gold rush GPUs, not promises.

Their success hinges on startups and Big Tech believing in genAI’s future not
necessarily profiting from it today.

**TL;DR**

  * The genAI race is real, but the margins aren’t.

  * Most startups are burning fast, growing revenue, and losing more.

  * Specialized use cases with measurable outcomes are the most promising path to survival.

  * If you’re building or backing in this space, track cost structure and adoption like a hawk.

You don’t want to be the next great AI company that scaled itself into a
financial corner.

Most people use AI like a fancy autocomplete. They type a question, grab the
first answer, and move on. But that only scratches the surface.

[Hiten Shah ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kCo_-
ZXLmvQ7r_DFVG2E7xaHerxWY3jX8DhiWjHpY7A/edit)shared a powerful thread recently
11 prompt structures that help you think better, uncover sharper insights, and
build stronger strategies using AI.

Here’s the full breakdown:

Every answer is a building block. Instead of a single question, try “Summarize
this” → “Now critique it” → “Now improve it” → “Now make it actionable.” One-
shot prompts give surface-level answers. Chains go deeper.

AI connects the dots in unexpected ways. Ask “Explain this like a sports coach
would”  
or “Compare this to how chess players think.” Ideas become clearer when framed
through a different lens. The best insights come from collisions.

AI defaults to the dominant perspective. Flip it. Try “Explain this from the
viewpoint of a sceptical CFO” or “Write this as if you are a customer who just
churned.” Seeing through different eyes forces clarity.

If everything is important, nothing is. Ask “Rank these in order of impact” or  
“If I could only do one, which should it be?” AI helps filter out noise. The
best decision-makers cut through complexity fast.

You don’t know what you don’t know. Ask “What are three questions I should be
asking but haven’t?” or “What’s missing from this strategy?”  
Most people focus on what’s there. The real leverage comes from what’s
missing.

AI defaults to clean, logical reasoning, but real-world ideas break under
pressure. Try “Find three ways this could fail” or “Where would this idea
collapse under real constraints?” The strongest strategies aren’t just good,
they survive reality.

Instead of refining an idea, destroy it and rebuild it stronger. Ask “List all
the weaknesses in this” then “Now reconstruct it while fixing those flaws.”  
Most people iterate by polishing. The best iterate by breaking and rebuilding.

AI thinks in averages. Force it to think in extremes. Try “Give me the most
radical version of this idea” or “Now strip it down to the absolute simplest
version.”  
You’ll uncover insights that never appear in the middle.

Great ideas work at multiple levels. Try “Explain this in one sentence” → “Now
in one paragraph” → “Now in a full-page breakdown.” If an idea doesn’t scale
from short to deep, it isn’t truly clear yet.

A message is only as strong as how it lands. Ask “Rewrite this with more
urgency” or “Make this more persuasive to an investor.” Great thinking isn’t
just about what you say. It’s about saying it the right way.

People focus on what’s there. The best focus is on what’s missing. Ask “What
isn’t being said here?” or “What’s implied but not directly addressed?” AI can
surface gaps in logic, positioning, or messaging that you wouldn't otherwise
see.

Sheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kCo_-

Raising money is tough for both founders and VCs, but it’s even harder for
VCs. They must persuade limited partners (LPs) to invest in their venture
capital funds.

I've analyzed how successful VCs craft pitch decks that help them raise
massive amounts of capital. Here's what I learned.

Think of fund managers as salespeople. Their pitch deck (or memo) is their
most powerful sales tool. It needs to do two things really well: hook LPs
enough to get that crucial first meeting, and serve as a compelling narrative
during and after the pitch.  

Here are four main takeaways to consider when creating a deck for LPs:

  1. The purpose of your pitch deck is to convince LPs of your ability to make outlier investments. Show how you access, make sound decisions on, and win exceptional deals.

  2. Your pitch deck should tell a clear, concise, and convincing version of your fund's story.

  3. Show, don't tell, using examples, numbers, and visuals to add credibility.

  4. Let others speak to your strengths with quotes from founders, testimonials from references, and committed LPs to establish social credibility.

But what Goes Into a $500M+ Fund Deck? Here's the winning structure I've seen
work:

  * Title: So, what's this fund called? Which fund is it?

  * Team: Who is the GP? Who else is on the team?

  * Access: How do you get access to high-quality investment opportunities? What's your advantage?

  * Ability to win: How will you win competitive deals? What's your value-add to founders?

  * Investment Focus: What are you investing in? Why? Do you have a unique insight into that focus?

  * Track record: Do you have investment experience? What's your past track record? What are your most impressive investments?

  * Fund structure: What's the size of the fund, the stage you're investing in, the number of expected investments, and other details on the fund structure?

  * Network: Who's in your orbit? Which founders, investors, and others do you collaborate with and can you show examples?

  * Appendix: Additional materials that might be useful to include
