##### **START WITH**

Ramp’s latest[ AI Index reveals](https://econlab.substack.com/p/are-we-in-an-
ai-bubble) that U.S. companies are entering a new phase of the AI curve, one
where adoption is stabilising, but spending is intensifying.

After nearly two years of explosive growth, paid AI adoption dipped 0.7% in
September, marking the second decline this year. But beneath that headline,
the story is less about retreat and more about market maturity.

**Here’s what’s happening:**

  * Adoption plateaus in tech and finance. About 73% of tech firms and 58% of finance companies now pay for AI tools, but growth has slowed as most early adopters consolidate spend and refine ROI.

  * Retention is rising fast. Annualized retention for AI tools has climbed from <50% in 2022 to ~60% in 2023, and is forecasted to hit 80%+ in 2025. Companies are sticking around longer once they integrate AI into workflows.

  * Enterprise spending explodes. The average contract value jumped from $143K in 2024 to $530K in 2025, with projections near $1M in 2026. Businesses may be buying fewer new tools, but they’re spending far more per vendor.

OpenAI continues to dominate (35.6% of paid adoption), while Anthropic trails
at 12.2%, and smaller players like xAI, Google, and DeepSeek are still in the
single digits.

AI adoption is entering its scaling era. Companies have picked their tools,
now they’re integrating them deeply, standardising workflows, and spending big
to scale use cases.

CB Insights’ latest [breakdown of Y Combinator’s Summer 2025
batch](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/y-combinator-summer2025) reveals a
clear shift: AI is no longer experimental, it’s enterprise-ready. The 165+
startups funded this season mark YC’s most practical, infrastructure-heavy
cohort yet.

  * **Voice AI enters regulated industries.** 16 startups are targeting complex, compliance-heavy sectors like finance and insurance (Altur, Veritus Agent, Qualify.bot, Wayline). Others, like Liva AI and Panels, are building proprietary training datasets, a moat that general-purpose models can’t match.

  * **Software development agents dominate.** With 20 dev-focused startups, YC continues its bet on AI engineering tools. Companies like Stagewise (frontend agents) and Interfere (autonomous debugging) go beyond Copilot-style assistance, tackling full lifecycle automation, including testing and hardware integration.

  * **The agent stack is maturing fast.** Nearly 50% of the batch builds AI agents, and 14 focus on agent infrastructure, evaluation (AgentHub), debugging (Fulcrum Research), and monitoring (Mohi). Others like Nozomio Labs and Imprezia are building new layers for context and monetisation.

  * **Efficiency replaces capability as the next frontier.** Startups like Stellon Labs (tiny frontier models), Herdora (low-latency inference), and DeepAware AI (data centre energy optimisation) reflect a market shift toward scaling AI affordably latency, cost, and sustainability now define adoption barriers.

For founders, this batch signals a turning point: the AI story has moved from
demos to deployment. YC’s next generation isn’t chasing hype, they’re building
the infrastructure and vertical tools enterprises will soon depend on.

PitchBook’s [latest note by Kyle
Stanford](https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q4-2025-pitchbook-analyst-note-
seed-under-pressure), Director of US Venture Research, highlights how today’s
market dynamics are tightening returns for early-stage investors from both
sides, larger seed rounds and longer exit timelines.

  * Seed rounds are bigger and ownership is shrinking. Rising round sizes have reduced seed investors’ average stake, making it harder to build diversified portfolios or maintain meaningful ownership in breakout companies.

  * More startups, but thinner slices. First-time financings in 2025 are pacing 16% ahead of 2023, but investors’ share of equity in eventual $500M+ exits has fallen from 68% in 2015 to 55% in 2025.

  * Companies are staying private longer. The median time from first VC check to IPO is now 11.5 years, up from 7.4 years a decade ago, creating liquidity pressure across the venture stack.

  * Secondaries offer relief, but at a cost. Selling early in secondary markets helps recycle capital but limits the upside LPs expect from long-duration VC bets.

  * 800+ US unicorns and counting. The growing backlog of billion-dollar private companies is delaying exits and compounding the liquidity bottleneck.

As valuations stretch and holding periods lengthen, seed investors face a
return compression era, forced to balance liquidity needs against ownership
dilution. The traditional “spray and pray” seed model may soon need
rethinking.

##### **SOMETHING MORE**

Compensation advice is everywhere and most of it doesn’t apply to a five-
person startup trying to make its first few hires.

Early-stage founders often overthink the rules. They benchmark against Google,
overpay to win talent, or give away too much equity too soon. But as leaders
from Clay, Instacart, Google, Applied Intuition, and Confluent shared, early-
stage comp is less about formulas and more about philosophy.

Here’s [what rules you can break](https://review.firstround.com/what-early-
stage-founders-should-know-about-comp-the-rules-to-break-and-a-few-you-should-
actually-follow/), and which ones are worth keeping by Firstround.

**Rules to break**

**1\. “Give big equity to land talent.”**

Don’t. Early equity is far more expensive than it looks. Kaitlyn Knopp
(Pequity, ex-Instacart) says your **first 10 hires should get a combined max
of 10%** of the total pool. Even 1% each can be aggressive.

Too many startups burn through their option pool early, then have to take
equity from founders or investors to fix it later. Her advice: “Outline your
comp philosophy and stick to it. You have more leverage than you think.”

Also, teach candidates what equity actually means. At Facebook, Molly Graham
created a simple “Understanding Your Equity” guide to help candidates grasp
future value. Transparency turns fear into trust.

**2\. “Pay top-of-market to attract talent.”**

Qasar Younis (Applied Intuition) warns against inflating salaries just because
you can.  
“Founders are overpaying because they’ve raised large rounds. But high
salaries at the start destroy incentives and make the business unsustainable.”

The startup playbook still holds: lower cash, higher equity, and wealth
through company growth. At Applied, employees are now in the 99th percentile
of comp not because of high initial salaries, but because their stock grew.

**3\. “Wait for review season to adjust pay.”**

Varun Anand (Clay) says that’s outdated. “We don’t wait for review cycles. If
someone outperforms, we raise them right away.”

[](https://review.firstround.com/what-early-stage-founders-should-know-about-
comp-the-rules-to-break-and-a-few-you-should-actually-follow/) _Image Source:
First Round_

Clay’s approach: reward in real time. It builds loyalty, keeps top performers
motivated, and avoids resentment. The key: justify every raise with data and
measurable results, not emotion.

**4\. “Copy what big tech does.”**

Google-style pay formulas and equity bands don’t fit a seed-stage company.
Knopp says: “Most founders over-engineer early comp.

Build your own system based on your stage and philosophy. Read about
psychology and reward behaviour before copying anyone’s spreadsheet.”

**Rules to follow**

**1\. Define your compensation philosophy early.**

Even at 10–15 employees, clarity avoids chaos later. Ask:

  * How do our values show up in comp?

  * What’s our equity vs. cash ratio?

  * How transparent will we be?

  * How do we reward top performers?

Introduce **salary tiers** early, too. Four levels are enough:

  1. Junior (0–3 years)

  2. Mid-level (4–7 years)

  3. Senior (8–12 years)

  4. Principal/Leader (10–15+ years)

Benchmark roles against data sources like Radford or Mercer, then decide which
percentile (e.g., 50th, 75th) you’ll target.

As Instacart’s Udi Nir put it: “You won’t always have the highest offer, but
the best role and mission often win.”

**2\. Use contract-to-hire to test fit.**

Knopp says early-stage startups can’t afford bad hires or full salaries. “Some
of our best engineers started as 10-hour-a-week contractors,” she says. “It
let us test fit, build trust, and manage cash.”

Top talent today isn’t afraid of contract work; it’s a smart way to test
mutual value before committing.

**3\. Be transparent. Always.**

Colleen McCreary (Confluent, ex-Credit Karma) calls comp opacity a founder’s
biggest time drain. “When no one understands how they’re paid, you’ll spend
all your time talking about pay.”

At Credit Karma, she walked the entire company through the comp model, what
benchmarks they used, what percentile they paid at, and how equity worked.

Her simple rule: clarity kills confusion. If you don’t explain, you’ll explain
forever.

**4\. Calibrate by function, one size doesn’t fit all.**

Different roles demand different incentives.

  * **Sales:** Pay for results. Competitive base, plus commissions that double once targets are hit. Only pay commissions when cash is received.

  * **Customer Success:** Reward adoption and retention, not just renewals. Tie bonuses to usage, NPS, or product adoption metrics.

  * **Product:** Add outcome-based incentives.  
Tyler Hogge (ex-Divvy, Pelion) recommends linking PM comp to measurable
impact, ARR growth or retention improvement. Use equity-heavy rewards to align
ownership and urgency.

**5\. Make comp a reflection of culture.**

How you pay people signals how you lead. Compensation isn’t just money, it’s
communication.

  * Overpay too early → you lose discipline.

  * Underpay or hide your process → you lose trust.

  * Reward early and fairly → you build loyalty and speed.

Compensation at the early stage isn’t about spreadsheets. It’s about
alignment. Define your philosophy, educate your team, and move fast when
people earn it.

A new study from [Stanford Graduate School of Business
analysed](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ilyavcandpe_total-capital-raised-and-
unicorn-probability-activity-7383954760753844224-cu71/) how total capital
raised correlates with a startup’s chance of hitting the $1B valuation mark
and the results are clear: money matters, but only up to a point.

Startups that raise small rounds rarely make it to unicorn status, but those
that cross certain fundraising thresholds dramatically increase their odds.

Here’s what the data shows:

  * <$20M raised → 0.3% unicorn odds. Almost zero.

  * $20–40M → 1.2%. Triple the chance, but still low.

  * $40–80M → 2–4%. The early growth lift begins.

  * $120–160M → 5–6%. The probability accelerates.

  * $160–200M → 8–10%. The sweet spot.

  * $200M+ → 9.6%. Returns start to flatten.

Key takeaway: Raising more does increase your unicorn probability, but the
relationship plateaus after ~$200M. Beyond that, capital alone doesn’t make
you more likely to succeed.

For founders:

  * Hitting $100–200M raised signals institutional belief and maturity, this is where scaling velocity, not survival, defines outcomes.

  * But fundraising isn’t destiny. Execution, market timing, and compounding growth still drive whether those dollars turn into billions.

**In short:** Big rounds open the door to unicorn status. But what happens
next depends on what you build, not just what you raise.

Every founder asks the same question at the start: “Is my idea any good?” But
the best founders don’t look for generic validation; they run sharp,
unconventional tests that expose the truth fast.

Here’s how the founders of Linear, Mercury, Maven, Crossbeam, WorkOS, and
Sprig did it, [shared by
firstround](https://review.firstround.com/unconventional-tactics-for-
validating-your-startup-idea/):

**1\. The “Founder Discovery” Method, Crossbeam**

Instead of asking customers, founder **Bob Moore** asked other founders:
“Would you start this company?”

When multiple founders picked the same idea and started introducing him to
potential customers, he knew it was real.

→ Validation trigger: founders show FOMO and help you sell it.

**2\. The “Minimum Viable Test”, Maven (Gagan Biyani)**

Forget the MVP. Test the smallest atomic unit of your product that must work.

Example: Maven ran one paid cohort with Sam Parr before building anything,
9/10 satisfaction, $150K earned.

→ Validation trigger: people pay, rate high, and refer.

**3\. The “Sell It Before You Build It”, Material Security**

Founders pitched 4 startup ideas using fake sales decks, no product, no
mockups, just bullet points.

The winner? The one where prospects asked, _“How much does it cost?”_ and
_“When can we use it?”_

→ Validation trigger: prospects talk next steps, not compliments.

**4\. The “Undercover Research” — Linear**

While still at Uber, the founders quietly asked coworkers what they hated
about their dev tools.

Everyone complained but assumed it couldn’t be fixed, that insight became
Linear.

→ Validation trigger: strong pain that everyone accepts as “normal.”

**5\. The “Cold Test” — Sprig**

Ryan Glasgow refused to ask friends. He cold-emailed YC founders with mockups.

If strangers were willing to spend multiple hours co-designing with him, it
meant the pain was real.

→ Validation trigger: busy strangers volunteer their time repeatedly.

**6\. The “Feasibility First” — Mercury (Immad Akhund)**

Instead of testing demand, he tested if it was _possible_ to build a compliant
online bank.

He spoke to 90 lawyers, regulators, and fintech founders until the
“impossible” looked merely hard.

→ Validation trigger: the biggest barrier becomes a solvable challenge.

**7\. The “Bad Idea That’s Actually Good” — WorkOS (Michael Grinich)**

He looked for ideas everyone disliked but he knew were painful and unsolved.
Enterprise infrastructure felt boring and that was the moat.

→ Validation trigger: smart people dismiss it, but target users are desperate.

There’s no single “right” validation playbook, but the pattern is clear:

  * Test before you build.

  * Ask the right people (not just users, but founders, sceptics, and insiders).

  * Look for time, money, or introductions, not compliments.

Every “billion-dollar idea” starts with one signal that can’t be faked: real
people leaning in.

the Exit Velocity Index (EVI).

Not all billion-dollar exits are equal. RBCx’s new Exit Velocity Index (EVI)
ranks how efficiently startups create value, not just how big they get.

> EVI = (Exit Value / Total Equity Raised) × (1 / Exit Age)

It measures how fast and capital-efficient a company built enterprise value
across 3,317 North American VC-backed exits ($10M+, 2010–2025).

**1\. Big doesn’t mean efficient.**

Mega-exits like Uber, Palantir, Instacart, and Lyft rank far lower once you
factor in how much capital they burned and how long it took to exit.

→ Example: Uber’s EVI ≈ 5.3x, while Mir’s $400M exit on $2M raised in 2 years
scored EVI = 100, outperforming even WhatsApp’s legendary $22B exit.

**2\. Time kills velocity.**

Companies that took 15–20 years to exit (Yahoo, Reddit, ServiceTitan, Procore)
scored among the lowest EVIs despite large outcomes.

→ Median exit age of the top 100: 10 years.

**3\. Capital efficiency defines winners.**

Median capital efficiency: 13.9x, but only 0.8% of exits achieved EVI > 20.

That tiny group includes WhatsApp, Datadog, Coinbase, and a few under-the-
radar mid-sized acquisitions.

**Key takeaways**

  * **EVI reframes success:** size alone is a poor measure of performance.

  * **Efficiency and speed compound returns:** shorter build times and leaner raises often beat mega-funded unicorns.

  * **For LPs and founders:** benchmark by EVI, not just valuation. It reveals who built durable value fast, not just who raised the most.
