##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

Here’s a well-known secret: VCs don’t love crowded spaces.

If a bunch of companies are chasing the same problem, it means brutal
competition for customers, which usually means higher costs and slower growth.
Not exactly what investors dream of.

**But here’s the flip side—some companies** _**do**_**win in crowded
markets**. And when the market is big enough, VCs will still invest. The key?
They need to believe they’re betting on the right startup.

So, if you’re a founder building in a competitive space, the real question is:
how do you stand out?

That’s exactly what we’re diving into today.

To make this real, let’s talk about a space that’s super crowded: AI.
(Agree??)

Specifically, AI-powered sales development representatives (SDRs)—tools that
help sales teams find and qualify leads faster.

(From my VC friend: We see at least one AI SDR startup every week. There are
plenty more out there raising money. So yeah, it’s competitive.)

That said, sales as an industry has a huge total addressable market (TAM), and
AI is, well, everywhere right now. VCs want to invest in this space. But only
if they believe a startup can return 100 their money. ([Can your startup
return VC funds?](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/155318590/steps-to-
know-if-your-company-can-return-a-vc-fund))

**Which brings us to the challenge:**

  * How do you prove you won’t stall after some early traction?

  * How do you avoid insanely high customer acquisition costs?

  * How do you convince VCs you’re the one to bet on?

**The answer:** find a market wedge.

A wedge is simply a strategy to win a large market by initially capturing (1)
a tiny part of a larger market or (2) a large part of a small adjacent market.

So if you want to break into a crowded market, don’t try to be “just another
AI sales tool.” Instead, specialize.

Example: Instead of being a generic AI SDR, you could be the AI SDR for
veterinarians.

**Why? Because focusing on a niche:**

  * Gives you a clear target audience with a unique need.

  * Makes customer acquisition _way_ easier.

  * Helps you stand out from the sea of generic competitors.

**But VCs won’t just ask, “What’s your wedge?” They’ll ask, “How do you grow
beyond it?”**

Here’s where your expansion strategy comes in:

  1. Vertical Expansion – Offer more services to your niche.

     * You start with AI-powered sales for vets.

     * Then add appointment scheduling, inventory management, etc.

  2. Horizontal Expansion – Expand to similar industries.

The key is to show investors that you’re thinking beyond today’s niche and
into tomorrow’s empire.

A wedge is great. But without customers, it’s just a nice idea. VCs want to
see that you can acquire customers efficiently.

If you already have industry connections—amazing. Maybe you:

But what if you _don’t_ have these connections? That’s where partnerships can
be a game-changer.

For example, if you’re targeting veterinarians, you could:

  * Partner with some Medical Association to tap into their network.

  * Work with private equity firms that acquire vet clinics (and need them to grow).

  * Get backing from VCs specializing in pet tech, who can open doors.

> The goal is simple: show VCs you can acquire customers from day one—without
> breaking the bank.

Here’s another tip: **VCs love learning.**

If a founder teaches them something they didn’t know, it makes them _way_ more
likely to invest.

**That means your job is to be the expert.** You should know more about your
niche than anyone in the room.

How do you prove that?

  * **Challenge common assumptions:** _“_ Everyone thinks X about the veterinary industry, but actually, it’s Y.”

  * **Drop surprising insights:** _“_ Did you know 73% of pet owners would pay more for AI-enhanced vet services?” (Okay, I made that up, but you get the idea.)

  * **Offer a fresh perspective:** Explain why your approach makes more sense than the status quo.

And don’t shy away from the competition. **Yes, the market is crowded—but
that’s because the opportunity is massive.** If you can prove you understand
the market better than anyone else, you position yourself as the founder VCs
want to back.

So, if you’re in a crowded space and want to win investors over, here’s what
you need to do:

  * Find your market wedge—a niche that gives you an entry point.

  * Show how you’ll expand beyond that wedge over time.

  * Prove you can acquire customers efficiently (without insane costs).

  * Know your market better than anyone else in the room.

In a crowded market, the loudest voices don’t win—the smartest, most strategic
ones do.

So be different. Challenge assumptions. And make it impossible for investors
to ignore you.

Who knows? Maybe your AI-powered vet sales tool _is_ the next unicorn. Just
don’t forget the little people when you make it big. 😉

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

I’ve seen posts claiming that VCs will ask you 250+ questions in a pitch
meeting. That’s nonsense. No investor is sitting there running through a
checklist that long. (If you know one, let me know—I’d love to meet them.)

Instead, here’s a list of key questions you’re actually likely to face. These
are the ones I used to ask while working with VC firms, and I’ve also gathered
insights from leading investors to curate this list.:

  * Tell me a bit about your background and your co-founder(s)’s background.

  * How do you all know each other?

  * Why is your team uniquely motivated to solve this problem?

  * Why did you pick your co-founder?

  * Who do you need to hire during the next 18 months to be successful?

  * When was the last time you had disagreed on a business issue? How did you resolve it?

  * Do the founders have the knowledge to build the technology or would they need outside help?

  * What does the cap table look like? (equity distribution across founders)

  * How are people solving this problem today?

  * Describe your solution to this problem.

  * What effort / timing is required to switch from a different solution to yours?

  * (For deeptech) What is unique about the tech? (Do you have any patents / IP / trademarks?)

  * What is your product roadmap for the next 6-12 months?

  * Why now?

  * How big is this specific market?

  * What is your unfair advantage?

  * Who would you see as your key competitor at the moment? Why?

  * Who is your customer persona?

  * How much are people paying today? (range?)

  * How are you currently getting users / customers? (what customer acq channel(s)?)

  * How do you think you will get users / customers in the future?

  * How much does it cost you currently to get a user? And in which channel?

  * How much does your solution/product cost (COGs)?

  * Why do people buy / use your solution?

  * What is the sales cycle to-date?

  * How does the product team interact with current and potential customers? If so, how and how often?

  * What differentiates your solution from other alternatives?

  * Who are you more afraid of: Google or another startup?

  * What happens if a Google (or equiv) does this?

  * Who are the major players?

  * What is your moat?

  * When did you start the company?

  * How many customers do you have to-date?

  * How much revenue have you generated to date?

  * Any notable customers?

  * What does retention or churn look like? (if you know)

  * What does engagement look like?

  * Any upsells?

  * When will your company break even in terms of profitability and cash flow?

  * How much have you raised to date?

  * How much are you looking to raise?

  * Where are you in your round?

  * What is your burn rate?

  * What is your top priority for the next 3-6 months?

  * What are your capital costs? (if capital intensive, like hardware / e-commerce)

  * Have you secured a lead investor for the round? If so, who and how much is the lead investing?

That’s it. You don’t need to prepare for 250+ questions. Some questions might
even feel frustrating—like _“What if Google builds this?”_ or _“How does this
become a billion-dollar company?”_ I know many founders get stuck on these and
struggle to answer them.

That’s why I’ve put together a solid guide to help you tackle these questions
with confidence. You can check it out
[here](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/how-can-this-be-a-billion-
dollar).

[Bret Waters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bretwaters/) (Entreprenur & Prof.
Stanford) shared a short write-up about how his VC colleague thinks founders
often misunderstand CAC < LTV and what really matters. Most startups don’t
fail because the concept is flawed—they fail because they don’t track it
properly.

A business is simple—it attracts customers, delivers value, and makes a
profit. But if acquiring a customer costs more than what they bring in, that’s
a problem.

Many founders assume customers will come easily and stick around forever, but
in reality, marketing is expensive, and churn is inevitable. Optimism fades
when the numbers don’t add up. As Hemingway might say, startups go broke
gradually, then suddenly.

Investors care about LTV/CAC because it signals how well a business scales. If
every $1 spent on customer acquisition returns $5, that’s an engine worth
fueling.

Not all customers are equal. Often, 20% of customers generate 80% of profits.
Understanding who those high-value customers are and optimizing for them
changes everything.

Tracking cohorts is key—customers from Facebook ads behave differently than
those from referrals or Google ads. Knowing these patterns helps founders
spend money where it actually works.

Then there’s velocity. A high LTV/CAC ratio looks good on paper, but if it
takes years to recoup acquisition costs, it’s a problem. Some investors track
CACD—how fast an initial investment in CAC doubles. If it takes longer than
eight months, growth is too slow.

So CAC < LTV is fundamental, but often misused. Founders need to dig
deeper—focus on high-value customers, analyze acquisition sources, and track
how fast money returns. Do that, and you’re building something that not only
survives but scales.
