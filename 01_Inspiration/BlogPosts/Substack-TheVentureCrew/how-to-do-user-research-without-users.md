##### **FROM OUR PARTNER - ROCKET**

We’ve tested every major AI builder. They all share the same fundamental flaw:
they make you adapt to AI instead of AI adapting to you.

You learn prompt engineering. You write carefully. You retry constantly. You
debug AI mistakes. That’s not building. That’s negotiating.

[Rocket’s](https://www.rocket.new/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=venturecurator&utm_campaign=13thnov)
Precision Mode eliminates this entirely. Over 100 structured commands that
execute exactly what you specify. “Fix mobile layout” repairs responsive
issues. “Add Stripe integration” builds payment flows. “Optimise images”
compresses and converts. “Update pricing table” modifies content.

No interpretation. No guessing. No retries. Just precise execution. This is
what professional AI building looks like.

##### **📜 DEEP DIVE**

When you’re building an MVP or raising your first round, you usually don’t
have the luxury of long research cycles or access to dozens of users. But you
still need clarity: Who exactly are you building for? What do they care about?
How do they behave?

This is where AI-generated personas become incredibly useful.

Instead of spending weeks interviewing users, tools like ChatGPT can create
realistic, behaviour-driven personas based on your ideal customer profile.
These aren’t just demographic sketches; they simulate a user’s motivations,
fears, habits, workflows, and buying triggers.

Researchers even point out that generative AI can speed up persona creation
without sacrificing user-centred thinking, helping teams align faster and make
sharper product decisions early on.

Of course, AI personas don’t replace real users. But for founders moving fast,
they’re a powerful way to:

ChatGPT can generate rich, realistic personas from just a few inputs, but the
quality depends on what you ask for. The goal is not to create a demographic
sketch; it’s to capture the user’s goals, motivations, behaviours,
frustrations, and decision triggers.

That’s the information that actually guides product and UX decisions.

> A simple rule: Demographics tell you who they are. Motivations tell you what
> they’ll do.

**Core Prompt Template (Generate Persona)**

You can start with a structure like this:

    Create a detailed user persona for [ROLE or user segment] of our
    [PRODUCT/SERVICE]. Include their background, goals, motivations, and main pain points or frustrations related to [problem domain]. 

    Focus on how and why they would use the product. 

This forces the AI to go beyond surface-level traits and gives you a persona
you can actually design for.

For example, if you ask for a “Marketing Manager who struggles with data
privacy in finance apps,” ChatGPT will produce a persona with:

These are the elements that matter, not their age or whether they drink cold
brew.

**Add more detail when needed**

You can refine the persona by adding parameters like:

  * industry

  * team size

  * technical comfort

  * typical workflow

  * Tools they already use

Or by asking follow-ups like:

  * “What daily frustrations does this user face?”

  * “Describe their typical workflow from morning to evening.”

  * “What alternatives are they currently using and why?”

This iteration turns a basic persona into an actionable one.

**Another example prompt**

    Create a persona for a Sales Business Development Representative using a CRM app. Frame the persona around their goals, motivations, and behaviors. Include their main pain points and how they currently use similar tools. 

    Do not list demographic information unless it directly shapes their decisions.

This approach mirrors how modern UX teams work: personas built around roles,
tasks, context, and decision drivers, not superficial details.

**The goal: an actionable persona**

A good persona should help you answer:

  * What are they trying to get done?

  * What stops them from doing it?

  * What do they value in tools like yours?

  * When and how will they use your product?

If your persona clarifies these four things, you’ve got something you can
design, build, and pitch around.

Once you’ve built a persona, the next step is to talk to them or at least
simulate the conversation. ChatGPT can role-play as your target user and
answer questions the way a real person in that role might. This is one of the
fastest ways to stress-test assumptions before you speak to actual users.

**Set the stage with a role-play prompt**

Start by telling ChatGPT exactly who it should become. Give it the persona’s
name, context, and behaviours, then frame the interview scenario.

Example setup:

    You are [NAME], a [brief persona description] who regularly uses [PRODUCT/CATEGORY]. I am a product manager interviewing you to understand your needs, experiences, and frustrations. Stay fully in character and respond as [NAME] would.

Adding a couple of guidelines helps ChatGPT respond more realistically:

  * “You should role-play as a real user with clear goals, preferences, and frustrations.”

  * “You have experience with [competitor/product type] and will give honest feedback.”

This primes the model to think and speak like a real user rather than a
generic chatbot.

**Ask open-ended, conversational questions**

From here, treat it like a real interview. Ask questions that encourage depth,
not yes/no answers. For example:

  * “Can you walk me through how you currently handle [task]?”

  * “What’s the most frustrating part of that process?”

  * “What tools have you tried before, and why did you switch?”

  * “What would an ideal solution look like to you?”

Because ChatGPT stays in character, its responses feel like genuine user
feedback, complete with emotions, reasoning, and tradeoffs.

**Use ChatGPT to analyse the conversation**

After the role-play, you can shift modes and ask:

  * “Summarise the key pain points from this interview.”

  * “List the top jobs-to-be-done for this persona.”

  * “Highlight the strongest buying triggers or objections.”

This gives you a quick synthesis that mirrors what you would produce after a
real user interview.

**Why this works**

Simulated interviews won’t replace real conversations, but they help founders:

  * Catch flawed assumptions early

  * discover angles they hadn’t considered

  * refine messaging and feature priorities

  * prepare better questions for real users

In a fast MVP cycle, these simulations act like a rehearsal: low cost, fast
feedback, and surprisingly insightful.

Once your persona is defined, you can use it as a filter to evaluate your
product ideas, landing page copy, feature descriptions, or even early UX
flows. This gives you fast, persona-aligned feedback before you test with real
users.

**Ask the persona to react to your concept**

You can prompt ChatGPT to “think” like the persona and tell you how they would
respond to your idea or messaging.

Example prompt:

    Imagine you are [Persona Name]. Here is our product concept/messaging: [insert idea, copy, or landing page]. How would you react to this? What would you like, dislike, or find confusing? Stay in character and respond as [Persona Name] would.

This usually surfaces:

It’s a quick way to see how your message lands with the user you’re designing
for.

**Ask for targeted improvements**

You can also ask for focused, persona-driven suggestions:

  * “As a [Persona], what would you improve about this feature description?”

  * “What would make this onboarding flow easier for you?”

  * “What benefits matter most to you here?”

ChatGPT will respond from within the persona’s mindset, giving you feedback
grounded in their motivations, frustrations, and decision-making style.

If something stands out, go deeper:

  * “Why would that bother you?”

  * “Can you explain what feels unclear?”

  * “What would you expect instead?”

This turns a basic reaction into rich insight, like a real user interview.

**Role-play design or flow evaluations**

You can even test specific moments in the experience:

  * “Describe how you would feel going through this signup process on your phone.”

  * “As this persona, what questions would you ask after hearing this feature pitch?”

  * “What part of this dashboard would be most confusing to you and why?”

These role-plays often reveal usability issues, emotional reactions, and
missing clarity that founders typically catch only after shipping.

**Your only rule: keep ChatGPT in character**

Always remind the model:

“Please answer as [Persona Name] would.”

This keeps the feedback consistent, grounded, and aligned with the persona’s
worldview.

Personas aren’t just for interviews; you can use them to pressure-test your
roadmap and pricing decisions. By putting the persona in buying mode, you can
quickly see how they might evaluate tradeoffs, question pricing, or prioritise
features.

**Test reactions to a specific feature or price**

Use a simple role-play setup to understand perceived value:

    You are [Persona] (a [brief description]). We’re considering releasing Feature X at price $Y. What questions or concerns would you have? Would this feel worth the cost? Please answer as [Persona] would.

This helps surface things like:

  * expectations around value

  * price sensitivity

  * missing benefits

  * objections before purchase

  * reasons they might hesitate or churn

It’s not about predicting real budgets, it’s about understanding how your
ideal user **thinks** about value.

**Compare priorities between features**

You can also push the persona to evaluate tradeoffs:

    Act as [Persona]. Which of these two feature sets matters more to you, and why: [Feature A] vs. [Feature B]?

This forces ChatGPT to reason like the persona, revealing:

  * what they care about most

  * What feels “nice-to-have” vs. “must-have”

  * outcomes they prioritise

  * Features they would drop if pricing increases

**What you learn**

Since the model stays in character, you get insight into how this type of user
might:

For example, the persona might say things like:

Use these reactions to validate or challenge your assumptions before locking
in scope or pricing.

AI personas are most helpful in the early stages, when you’re ideating,
aligning the team, or quickly pressure-testing assumptions. They’re great for
brainstorming (“How would our target user react to this?”), and they help
teams rally around a shared picture of the user. They can also sharpen your
real research: a synthetic interview often reveals what questions you should
ask human users next.

But they’re not a replacement for real conversations. AI can summarise
motivations, goals, and frustrations, but it often misses nuance and emotional
depth. ChatGPT can predict reactions, it can’t replicate lived experience.
Think of its output as hypotheses, not conclusions.

> Put simply: Use AI personas as a practice run. Use real users to make real
> decisions.

As soon as you have a product concept or MVP, switch to actual interviews to
validate what matters. The strongest approach is a blend: use ChatGPT to draft
personas, explore ideas, rehearse interviews, then go out and talk to users
and compare the insights.

The strongest approach is a mix of AI-generated insights and real user data.
For example, you can take interview transcripts or survey quotes and feed them
into ChatGPT for fast synthesis.

Builders like Shavin from Buildspace [have shown that giving ChatGPT
](https://buildspace.so/notes/chatgpt-customer-research)raw customer quotes
can instantly generate themes, job stories, and problem statements that
normally take hours.

It’s a great way to accelerate analysis, as long as you double-check
everything.

ChatGPT sometimes makes confident but incorrect conclusions, so always
validate AI output against the source data. If the model suggests a new pain
point, check whether it truly appeared in interviews.

A simple loop works well:

  1. Draft a persona or interview script in ChatGPT.

  2. Talk to a few real users and see what aligns or diverges.

  3. Feed the real answers back into ChatGPT to extract themes or refine personas.

  4. Update your product or messaging using both sources.

This lets you move fast while staying grounded. AI helps you explore and
structure ideas; real users ensure accuracy and nuance.

Be cautious about where AI can go wrong. ChatGPT can hallucinate, inventing
details, competitors, or statistics that sound real but aren’t. Research has
documented this pattern, and it’s one of the top concerns with AI personas. It
can also amplify bias, creating personas that feel overly polished or missing
uncomfortable truths.

Avoid confirmation bias by using neutral prompts.

Don’t ask “Does this idea make sense?” Ask “What might be confusing or risky
about this idea?” When accuracy matters, keep the temperature low to reduce
randomness.

Most importantly, never act on AI-generated insights without evidence. If
ChatGPT says, “Users would love Feature X,” ask: Do I have any proof? Cross-
check with mentors, data, or real interviews. AI isn’t thinking, it’s
predicting patterns, so you must stay critical.

Many teams use AI personas to speed up early product work:

**Fast persona creation.** At Traders Eco, a PM used ChatGPT to
[generate](https://canny.io/blog/7-product-managers-used-chatgpt-heres-what-
happened/#:~:text=) detailed personas from a simple target audience
description, helping her team quickly align on “who our user is.”

**Rapid mockups and idea testing.** Hootsuite’s GM, Partho Ghosh,
[shared](https://canny.io/blog/7-product-managers-used-chatgpt-heres-what-
happened/#:~:text=,The%20output%20is%C2%A0fantastic%21%E2%80%9D) that his team
uses ChatGPT plus image tools to prototype landing pages and concepts quickly,
allowing them to explore ideas without engineering time.

**Accelerated feedback analysis.** Canny’s co-founder Sarah [uses
ChatGPT](https://canny.io/blog/7-product-managers-used-chatgpt-heres-what-
happened/#:~:text=) to scan support conversations, surface feature requests,
and group similar user messages — saving hours.

Another PM built a pipeline to cluster raw reviews and then used GPT to
summarise each cluster’s pain points.

In all cases, founders emphasise the same point: AI made them faster, not
smarter than real users. They still validate everything with actual
conversations before committing to decisions.

So - AI personas and simulated interviews are powerful for early-stage
founders: they help you ideate faster, stress-test ideas, and align your team
before talking to real users. With clear prompts and careful iteration,
ChatGPT becomes a valuable brainstorming partner not a replacement for user
research.

Use it to explore possibilities, reveal blind spots, and draft hypotheses.
Then go validate those hypotheses with real conversations. That combination is
where AI actually shines: giving you speed without losing the human insight
your product depends on.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Henley Wing Chiu [scraped every detectable ChatGPT
Enterprise](https://bloomberry.com/blog/i-analyzed-all-of-chatgpts-enterprise-
customers-heres-what-i-learned/) and Teams customer using Bloomberry’s real-
time B2B purchase data. OpenAI claims explosive enterprise growth this year,
but Henley’s analysis shows a more grounded picture of how AI is actually
being adopted inside organisations.

Most large companies still aren’t using it. Only about 5 per cent of the
Fortune 500 have adopted ChatGPT Enterprise.

Even companies that banned ChatGPT last year still haven’t reversed course.
Apple, Amazon, JPMorgan, and Spotify, all remain absent. And none of the
world’s ten largest tech companies appear as paying customers. Privacy fears,
regulatory pressure, and internal AI strategies all slow adoption.

But where speed matters, adoption is much higher. Tech companies lead with 8.2
per cent penetration, followed by fast-moving fintechs at 6.6 per cent.

Startups use ChatGPT Enterprise twice as often as public companies because
they don’t have procurement bottlenecks, political risk, or complex security
reviews. They just move faster.

Here are the clearest patterns Henley found:

  * Tech + fintech industries lead adoption

  * Industrials, utilities, and energy barely use it

  * Startups are twice as likely to purchase as public companies

  * US companies adopt faster than the EU and Canada

  * Government adoption is nearly zero due to compliance and data laws

One unexpected insight: ChatGPT Enterprise usage is not reducing hiring. In
fact, companies using it posted roughly the same number of new job openings as
last year.

Non-customers saw a decline of about 7 per cent. If AI is replacing workers,
it’s not showing up in hiring data yet.

Another counterintuitive trend: companies not using ChatGPT Enterprise are
hiring AI talent much faster. They increased AI-related job postings by 120
percent. ChatGPT Enterprise customers only grew AI hiring by 27 per cent.

The cleaner explanation is that non-customers are building internal AI tools
and need engineers. Customers are effectively outsourcing that layer to OpenAI
instead of staffing those teams.

There are also signs that even slow, conservative industries aren’t ignoring
AI entirely. Three of the Big Four accounting firms — PwC, KPMG, and EY — are
already active ChatGPT Enterprise customers. Audit prep, tax analysis, policy
reviews, and research-heavy workflows map perfectly to LLMs.

What it means for operators and founders:

  * ChatGPT Enterprise isn’t mainstream yet, but early adoption is accelerating

  * Startups and tech-first organisations are leading the curve

  * Slow-moving enterprises won’t switch until privacy, compliance, and data retention guardrails feel airtight

  * Companies choosing _not_ to buy ChatGPT Enterprise often compensate by building internal AI stacks

  * AI isn’t eliminating jobs yet — but it’s reshaping where companies invest talent

Jason Lemkin shared [new Crunchbase data](https://www.saastr.com/crunchbase-
were-at-the-highest-level-of-unicorn-production-in-3-years/) showing something
we haven’t seen in 3+ years: unicorn creation is accelerating again.

October 2025 alone added 20 new unicorns and $44.5B in value, the strongest
month since early 2022. The energy founders are feeling isn’t imaginary. The
market is reopening, but in a very specific way: capital is concentrating
around AI-native winners, not spread across the ecosystem like 2021.

For B2B SaaS founders, the important part isn’t the unicorn count, it’s what
the underlying pattern reveals.

The funding environment is stabilising. Not frothy, but functional. If you’re
at $2M-$5M ARR, with strong net retention and sane CAC payback, there is money
available again.

Investors are quietly re-engaging in growth rounds, particularly where the
fundamentals appear solid.

AI-native companies are now in their own tier. VCs are no longer rewarding “AI
features.” They’re rewarding AI as the operating system of the product. That
means:

  * AI workflows that materially reduce costs

  * AI automations that replace old processes

  * AI capabilities that competitors cannot bolt on

  * If your product uses AI, you’re one of many. If your product is made possible because of AI, you’re in the group getting unicorn-level attention.

The bar is higher—far higher—but the upside is back. Twenty unicorns in a
month sounds huge, but thousands of companies raised rounds in October. The
conversion rate remains extremely low. That’s why this wave is different from
the 2021 bubble: it’s not momentum-driven; it’s performance-driven.

Here’s what this means practically, if you’re building now:

  * You need unmistakable traction: prove your product works at scale

  * You need AI advantage, not AI flavour

  * You need efficiency, not burn-your-way-to-growth storytelling

  * You need to show defensibility, not just early adoption

  * Investors are rewarding companies that look durable, not just “hot.”

The next wave of unicorns is being formed right now. The market didn’t snap
back; it healed enough for the best teams to break out again. If you’re
building something real, this is the window. If you’re average, the market
will ignore you.

The wave is here. Whether you catch it depends entirely on execution and
whether your AI advantage is real, not cosmetic.
