##### **FROM OUR PARTNER - BOARDY**

I’d been trying to meet D2C founders for partnerships, but cold outreach was
going nowhere.

Then I messaged [Boardy](https://whatsapp.boardy.ai/r/venture-curator) on
WhatsApp. Within minutes, its AI called me, asked about my startup, and who I
wanted to meet. That same day, I had a double opt-in intro to a perfect-fit
founder, someone already open and excited to connect.

**Founders use it to meet investors, land customers, hire talent, or get
expert advice**.

Every intro is vetted, so your time isn’t wasted, and the whole process feels
personal, quick, and effortless. One clear ask, one valuable connection.

**[Boardy’s](https://whatsapp.boardy.ai/r/venture-curator) already helped
founders close millions in funding** and deals through intros like this.

##### **📜 DEEP DIVE**

Some of the fastest-growing products in the world didn’t scale because of big
ad budgets. They grew because their users created content that attracted more
users.

Notion pages, Canva designs, Duolingo streaks, and Figma files all turned
ordinary usage into free distribution. This is user-generated distribution
(UGD): a growth loop where every action a user takes can bring in the next
one.

  * **Self-reinforcing:** users create → others see → new users join → they create more.

  * **Trustworthy:** People trust peer content more than brand ads.

  * **Cost-efficient:** lowers CAC and compounds over time.

Now let’s break down how different companies designed these loops and how you
can, too.

**Notion: templates as a flywheel**

Featured Notion templates library

  * **Problem solved:** new users froze at a blank page.

  * **Solution:** starter templates + an open template gallery. Every public page could be shared and duplicated in one click.

  * **Community:** Ambassadors and template creators were spotlighted and allowed to monetise.

  * **Result:** Notion grew from 1M → 100M users mostly via organic sharing.

Seed initial content yourself, then let your community build on it. Templates
don’t just activate users; they advertise your product.

**Duolingo: volunteers built the product**

Image Source: Duolingo Wiki

  * **Problem solved:** too many languages to build in-house.

  * **Solution:** The Incubator lets bilingual volunteers create entire courses.

  * **Quality control:** 200k+ daily lesson reports from learners, triaged by community + AI.

  * **Engagement:** streaks, leaderboards, and shareable achievements kept learners hooked (and bragging).

Passionate users will build for you if you give them tools, recognition, and
feedback loops.

**Canva: designs that spread themselves**

  * **Problem solved:** non-designers needed inspiration.

  * **Solution:** template marketplace (90% user-created). Creators earn 35% royalties, fueling constant content.

  * **Distribution:** one-click exports to socials, “Made with Canva” attribution, and hashtag contests.

  * **Result:** 13B+ designs created → millions shared → endless organic exposure.

Design your product so that what users make is naturally social + proudly
branded.

**Figma: collaboration = growth**

  * **Problem solved:** design files stuck on desktops.

  * **Solution:** multiplayer browser design → every file invite brought in new users.

  * **Community:** launched Figma Community, where users publish UI kits, icon sets, and templates for one-click remix.

If your product can be collaborative, usage itself is distribution. If not,
make outputs easy to remix and reshare.

**Marketplaces: content as acquisition**

  * **Reddit/Quora/Stack Overflow:** every post = SEO fuel → brings in new users searching → they post more.

  * **TripAdvisor/Yelp:** reviews created a content moat that no competitor could replicate with ads.

  * **Airbnb/Etsy:** each host or seller listing doubled as an ad, often shared across other networks.

Every listing, review, or answer should serve both utility and distribution.

> Across these examples, the pattern is consistent – users create value that
> begets more users.

> Whether it’s templates, answers, reviews, or listings, empowering users to
> contribute content turns your customer base into a self-expanding marketing
> force.

So, how can you design and build a successful UGD loop for your startup?

**1\. Seed the loop (solve the empty room problem)**

  * Don’t launch with a blank slate. Create starter templates, examples, or listings yourself.

  * Recruit early power users (designers, writers, hosts) to contribute first content. Pay or spotlight them if needed.

  * Provide single-player value: Pinterest worked even if no one else was on it. Same with Instagram filters.

**2\. Incentivise & curate quality (not just quantity)**

  * Intrinsic rewards: badges, leaderboards, recognition in the community.

  * Extrinsic rewards: monetisation, revenue share, premium perks. Canva pays royalties. Notion allowed template sellers to earn.

  * Curation: actively feature the best user content (template galleries, “featured” boards) so new users see quality, not junk.

**3\. Build compounding mechanics (so each use spreads you)**

  * Make every output public and portable: SEO-indexed pages, embeddable widgets, or social-share-ready exports.

  * Shorten time-to-value: one-click “Use this template” or “Remix this design” buttons make adoption frictionless.

  * Bake distribution into workflows: Calendly links, Typeform footers, Figma invites. Usage = marketing.

  * Add social bragging hooks: Duolingo streaks, Strava runs, Spotify Wrapped. Make achievements visually appealing and easily shareable.

**4\. Measure and iterate**

  * Track share rate (what % of users share or invite).

  * Track conversion (do viewers become users?).

  * If loops don’t work, fix the landing experience, not just the share button.

Remember, any social sharing should feel like it benefits the user’s identity
or needs (they want to show off, or help others, or document something) – if
it’s purely to advertise your brand, users will see through it.

> The goal is aligning the user’s desire to share for their own sake with your
> goal of distribution. Canva made designs shareable because users wanted to
> show their beautiful graphics. Duolingo made progress sharing fun because
> users wanted to celebrate their streak. Always ask, “would our users
> genuinely want to share this with their friends?” If yes, make it easy; if
> not, reconsider the approach.

User-generated distribution can be a game-changing growth driver, but it must
be cultivated thoughtfully. Here are the major takeaways and common pitfalls:

  * **Forcing virality where it doesn’t belong.** Not every product is naturally social. If you shove referral prompts where they don’t fit, users feel spammed. Virality only works if what’s shared has intrinsic value to the recipient.

  * **Incentives that backfire:** Paying per referral or per post brings spam, fake accounts, and low-quality contributions. Align rewards with retention or quality: e.g. reward only if referred users are active for 30 days.

  * **Ignoring moderation:** User content without curation becomes noise. Early-stage? Curate manually. At scale? Build community guidelines, flagging tools, and algorithms to keep quality high.

  * **Assuming loops run on autopilot:** UGD loops need constant seeding, iteration, and community support. Empty forums or dead galleries are worse than none.

  * **Forgetting product-market fit:** UGD amplifies what exists. If the core product doesn’t solve a real problem, no loop will save it. Duolingo’s community loop worked because the app itself taught languages well.

  * **Neglecting contributors:** Your creators are partners, not free labour. If they feel unappreciated or exploited, they leave (YouTube creators know this well). Always make sure they win, too.

The best founders design products where every user action becomes marketing.

Users create → outputs attract others → new users join → they create more.

##### **📄 QUICK WIN**

Every founder hits the same wall: you have an idea you believe in, but
uncertainty keeps you up at night. Is this the right problem? Do customers
care? Will they change their behaviour? Will anyone pay enough for this to
become a real business?

[Sequoia’s Arc PMF Terrifying ](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/pmf-
framework/)Questions Framework is built exactly for that moment. It helps you
confront those doubts directly, break them into four specific questions, and
use clear signals to know when you’re on the right track.

Think of it as a day-to-day playbook for achieving product–market fit.

**1\. What is my company’s right to exist?**

  * Start by pressure-testing your founder-market fit and why the timing is now.

  * Indicators you’re on track:

    * You can clearly explain why the market is compelling and why your wedge works.

    * Your unique advantage as a founder comes into focus.

    * You feel conviction growing the deeper you dig.

  * Resolution: You’re willing to marry this idea for the next decade, like David Vélez choosing Nubank over joining Sequoia.

**2\. Do people care enough?**

  * Customer validation is the only way to answer this. Have dozens of conversations until patterns emerge.

  * Indicators:

    * High hit rate on cold outreach.

    * Customers lean in, say “I want this now,” or show willingness to pay.

    * A few design partners emerge, eager to co-create.

  * Resolution: You’ve identified a passionate ICP, like DoorDash, discovering small restaurants desperate for delivery help.

**3\. Does my product change behaviour?**

  * Build and iterate until one feature becomes sticky enough to shift customer behaviour.

  * Indicators:

    * A clear “aha” moment in demos.

    * Short activation → fast value.

    * Users keep coming back to one feature.

    * Power users and evangelism appear.

  * Resolution: A growing base of retained users proves you’re delivering durable value. Dropbox’s early virality came from optimising for file sharing until it spread exponentially.

**4\. Will customers pay enough to build a business?**

  * Test pricing, packaging, and sales motions the same way you test features.

  * Indicators:

    * Customers don’t baulk at price.

    * Free users upgrade quickly.

    * Contracts move fast, not stuck in procurement.

    * Competitors don’t drag you into price wars.

  * Resolution: You have paying customers who see clear ROI, and you can model a path to real scale. Square cracked this by giving hardware away free and charging per transaction.

**The loop never ends.** You’ll revisit these questions every time you expand
products or customers. PMF isn’t a finish line; it’s a constant cycle. Even
Robinhood, post-IPO, had to revisit who cared most, what behaviour they wanted
to change, and how to capture value.

In the early days, it’s hard to know if you’re making real progress. ARR and
churn rates take time to appear, and vanity metrics can mislead. But traction
often shows up first in subtle, surprising ways, cues that don’t look like
“success” at the time, but signal that something is working.

Here are the non-obvious signs shared by [Firstround](http://firstround.com)
that every founder should watch for:

  1. **Criticism is better than silence**

Complaints mean people care. If users get angry when your product fails or
demand fixes, it shows they rely on it. Silence, on the other hand, often
means irrelevance. A surge in complaints can be painful, but it’s often the
first sign you’ve built something important.

  2. **Strangers are willing to try it**

Friends and contacts might use your product out of loyalty, not real need.
Cold outreach that gets a high response rate is a truer signal. If busy
strangers spend time testing your product, it means you’re solving a pain real
enough to cut through the noise.

  3. **You’re swamped with feature requests**

Early customers asking for more, even complaining about missing features,
means they’re invested. A flood of requests shows they see your product as
critical, not a toy. It’s a signal you’re being “pulled” forward by real
demand.

  4. **You catch people using it in the wild**

A signed contract is not the same as adoption. True traction shows up when you
walk into a customer’s office (or log onto a call) and see your product open
on their screen without prompting. That’s when you know usage has gone beyond
decision-makers into daily workflows.

  5. **People buy the idea, not just the product**

Sometimes demand comes even before the product is polished. When prospects are
willing to sign up, commit, or even pay based on a pitch deck or prototype,
it’s a strong sign the market pull is there — even if the product is
unfinished.

  6. **The community response is unusually positive**

Online forums, launch platforms, or niche communities are usually sceptical.
If instead you see encouragement, positive word-of-mouth, or silence where you
expected roasting, it’s a leading indicator that your positioning resonates.

  7. **People start using your company’s name**

When industry peers casually mention your company by name, it signals you’re
entering the conversation. Hearing your startup’s name outside your own circle
is a subtle but powerful proof of market recognition.

  8. **Competitors you respect are building the same thing**

Competition from credible teams isn’t always bad; it can validate that the
problem is real and urgent. If other smart builders are racing toward the same
solution, it’s a clue that the market is worth chasing.

  9. **You can finally relax (a little)**

Founders often feel like every customer is the last one. But when you start
closing deals or signing users with less panic, it’s a sign of repeatability.
The stone no longer rolls back down the hill every time you stop pushing.

  10. **You’d use it yourself**

When dogfooding surprises you — catching bugs, saving hours, or making your
own work easier — it validates you’ve built something genuinely useful. If
your toughest critic (you) depends on it, chances are others will too.

  11. **Founder morale trends upward**

Your own emotions can be a hidden metric. If your mood improves consistently
as feedback turns positive and usage grows, it’s often a lagging indicator of
traction becoming real. A founder’s rising confidence is usually mirrored by
customers.

The Productboard CEO and founder created a “founder mood meter” where he wrote
down his mood three times each day, rated on a scale of one through five. Upon
reviewing his entries, the takeaway was clear: When your mood is consistently
high, things are working. Maybe you can try something like this:

Remember - not all progress shows up in dashboards. Early traction hides in
complaints, cold responses, requests, community chatter, and your own mindset.
If you start noticing these signals, lean in; they’re the sparks that often
precede the numbers.
