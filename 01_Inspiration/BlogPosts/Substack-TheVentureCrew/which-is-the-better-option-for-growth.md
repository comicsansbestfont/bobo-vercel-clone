I have been speaking with multiple founders from the early stage to the growth
stage. While raising the fund at their growth stage or wanting a fund to
achieve growth milestones, they always got confused about whether to go for
venture debt or venture capital. And they always wonder which one is a good
option considering the risk & benefits.

If you are one of them getting confused about which option is better to go for
your growth stage startup, then this is the write-up for you. We will
understand this with a simple example.

Consider a founder who is looking to raise $2M to achieve his next growth
milestones and he is wondering whether to go for $2M Venture Capital or $2M
Venture Debt. Let’s decode this and see which one is the best option for
fundraising.

**Option One: Venture Capital**

Let considers some terms about the company.

\- Pre-money Valuation of the Company= $12M  
\- Venture Capital Raised= $2M  
\- Post-money Valuation= $14M (Pre Money + Investment Amount)

\- Equity Dilution = $2M/$14M = 14.28%

\- Company Valuation at Exit= $50M (You can get this through financial
modelling)  
\- Venture Capital Gain= $50M*14.28%= $7.14M (till exit the vc firm able to
maintain the equity)

**Second Option: Venture Debt**

Venture Debt is typically structured as a Term Loan with Interest Payments and
WARRANTS.

If you are not aware of the Warrant term - let me explain to you in simple
terms - “Warrants are a security that gives the holder the right (but not the
obligation) to purchase company stock at a specified price within a specific
period of time.”  

\- Pre-money Valuation of the Company= $12M  
\- Venture Debt Raised= $2M

\- Pre-Money Valuation= Post-Money Valuation ( for ease of calculation
subscription of shares from Venture Debt has been considered as a Capital
Increase at a Marginal Value)

\- Venture Debt Annual Interest Rate= 12% (monthly 1%)  
\- Tenure= 36 months  
\- Facility Fees= 1%  
\- Legal Fees= 1%  
\- Warrant Coverage= 20%

\- Warrant Coverage= $2M (Venture Debt)*20%= $400K  
\- Dilution= $400K/ $12M (Post-money Valuation)= 3.33% (remember for Venture
Capital Financing it was 14.28%)

\- Facility Fees= $2M*1%= $20K  
\- Legal Fees= $2M*1%= $20K

Next will calculate the Monthly Interest and Principal Payment:  

\- Used PMT function on an Excel sheet  
\- It will look like this = -PMT(monthly interest rate, total number of
payments for the loan, present value of the debt, future value, type)  

\- Monthly Interest+ Principal Payment=-PMT(1%, 36, $2M, 0, 0)= $66,429  
\- Total Payments in 36 Months= $66,429*36= $2.39M  
\- Total Interest Payment= $2.39M- $2M= $.39M  

\- Total Interest Payment+ Facility Fees+ Legal Fees= $.39M+ $20K+ $20K= $.43M  

\- Now Company Valuation at Exit= $50M  
\- Cost of Warrants= $50M*3.33%= $1.66M  

\- Total Interest Payments+ Facility Fees+ Legal Fees+ Cost of Warrants=
$.43M+ $1.66M= $2.09M  
\- Venture Debt= $2M  

\- Total Payment to Venture Debt Lender= $2M+ $2.09M= $4.09M  
\- IRR Calculation: $2M (1+R)^3= $4.09M, R= 27.01%  

Finally,  
\- Venture Capital Gain= $7.14M  
\- Venture Debt Gain= $4.09M  
\- Overall gain to the Founder if he considers Venture Debt option= $7.14M-
$4.09= $3.05M

I hope this will give an idea of how Venture Debt is cheaper than Venture
Capital.
