##### **TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

Top Founders know that fundraising is a critical skill that’s much harder than
meets the eye. But what’s rarely discussed is “F**undraising is a learned
skill**.” And VCs almost always have the upper hand because they deal with it
all day, every day.

In reality, knowing what to expect from VCs – the negotiation dynamics
Founders are likely to encounter – is half the battle.

Before you start talking with VCs, take the time to learn how to detect and
manage these little-known fundraising dynamics. Let’s dig in. ( We are sharing
this in a more conversational format….)

  1. **The Portfolio Trap**

**VC:** "I'd like you to meet with one of our portfolio companies in your
space. They can provide valuable insights, and we'd appreciate their
perspective on your venture."

This request often puts founders in a tricky position. Sharing your plans with
a potential competitor can be risky, and the existing portfolio company has
little incentive to endorse your startup. They may tell the VC they're
planning to expand into your area, making it challenging for the investor to
back you. While VCs might have good intentions, this practice can sometimes
backfire or be used to gather intelligence for their existing investments.

**Founder’s Reply:** If the suggested company is too close to your business,
politely decline:

"I appreciate the offer and value your network. However, given the significant
overlap between our business and this portfolio company, I'm not comfortable
sharing our strategic plans. Perhaps we could meet with other industry experts
who aren't directly in our space?"

If the portfolio company isn't a direct competitor, consider accepting:

"Thank you for the introduction. I'd be happy to meet with them. It would be
valuable to hear about their experience working with your firm and get their
industry insights."

Remember, your goal is to protect your business interests while maintaining a
positive relationship with the potential investor. If you do meet, use it as
an opportunity to learn about the VC's support and working style from an
existing portfolio founder's perspective.

  2. **The Valuation Conversation**

**VC:** "What valuation are you looking for in this round?" or "What's your
target price for the company?"

This question is a common tactic used by VCs to gauge your expectations and
potentially anchor negotiations at a lower point. While it's a legitimate
inquiry, it can be a pitfall for founders who, in an attempt to appear
reasonable, might suggest a valuation below their company's true worth.
Remember, any figure you mention could become the ceiling, not the floor, for
further discussion.

**Founder’s Reply:** Unless you're dealing with a priced extension round or a
convertible note with predetermined terms, it's wise to defer to market
dynamics. A tactful response might be:

"We're open to letting the market determine our valuation. We're more focused
on finding the right partners who can add value beyond just capital."

If you've had a previous funding round, you can provide context without
committing to a specific number:

"Our last round valued the company at $X million post-money. Since then, we've
achieved significant milestones, including [brief mention of key metrics or
achievements]. We believe these developments have substantially increased our
value, but we're eager to hear the market's perspective."

This approach demonstrates confidence in your company's progress while leaving
room for negotiation and avoiding the trap of undervaluing your startup
prematurely.

  3. **Turn Into Home Run**

**VC:** "Based on our analysis, we'd like to offer you $X million at a
valuation of $Y million."

This initial offer might seem disappointingly low. It's a common strategy in
VC negotiations, often serving as a starting point rather than a final stance.
Inexperienced founders sometimes react emotionally, potentially derailing a
deal that could have been salvaged with the right approach.

**Founder’s Reply:** The key is to remain composed and professional. A
strategic response might look like this:

"Thank you for your offer. We appreciate your interest in our company. While
this valuation is considerably below our expectations, we'd like to take some
time to review it in detail. We'll get back to you soon with our thoughts."

This response acknowledges the offer without accepting or rejecting it
outright. It buys you time to explore other options and potentially leverage
them.

If you receive more attractive offers later, you can circle back:

"We've had some time to consider your offer and explore the market. We've
received interest at significantly higher valuations that better align with
our growth trajectory and potential. We value our relationship and wanted to
allow you to revisit your offer if you're interested. If not, we completely
understand and hope to stay in touch for future opportunities."

This approach keeps the door open while signalling that you have other
options. It gives the VC a chance to improve its offer without burning
bridges. Remember, maintaining positive relationships in the VC world can be
beneficial for future funding rounds or networking opportunities.

  4. **Deflect the Friendly Lowball**

**VC:** After a warm, engaging meeting filled with enthusiasm and positive
feedback, the VC follows up with a surprisingly low offer. This unexpected
contrast between their friendly demeanour and the underwhelming valuation can
catch founders off guard.

This scenario often leads founders to doubt their judgment or feel pressured
to accept a subpar offer due to the perceived rapport. It's a subtle tactic
that leverages the positive connection established during the meeting.

**Founder’s Reply:** The key is to maintain your composure and separate your
emotions from the business decision at hand. A balanced response might look
like this:

"Thank you for the offer. We truly enjoyed our meeting and appreciate your
enthusiasm for our vision. However, the proposed valuation is significantly
lower than what we believe reflects our company's current value and potential.
We'd like to take some time to carefully consider this offer in the context of
our market research and growth projections. We'll get back to you soon with
our thoughts on how we might bridge this gap."

If the VC doesn't adjust their offer, you can follow up with:

"We've given your offer careful consideration. While we greatly value the
potential of working together, we feel that this valuation doesn't align with
our company's trajectory and the current market. We're open to further
discussion if there's room for adjustment. If not, we hope to keep the door
open for future opportunities as our company grows."

This approach maintains a positive relationship while firmly asserting your
company's value. It leaves room for negotiation without committing to an
undervalued deal. Remember, a good partnership should be mutually beneficial,
balancing enthusiasm with fair terms.

  5. **Focus on Pre-Money Valuation**

**VC:** "We're looking at investing $2M at an $8M post-money valuation."

VCs often frame discussions in post-money terms, which can lead to confusion
and potentially reduced founder ownership if the round size changes.

**Founder’s Reply:** "Thank you for the offer. To ensure we're on the same
page, let's discuss this in terms of pre-money valuation. Based on your
proposal, we're looking at a $6M pre-money valuation. Is that correct? We
prefer to focus on pre-money valuation as our fundraising target may adjust."

  6. **ESOP Negotiations**

**VC:** "We'd like to see a 20% ESOP allocation before the round."

VCs often push for large ESOP pools to reduce their future dilution. They may
request excessive allocations, sometimes up to 20% or more, which can
significantly impact founder ownership.

**Founder’s Reply:** "We've analyzed our hiring needs until the next funding
round. Based on our projections, a 10% post-round ESOP pool should suffice.
This includes 2% for a key hire we've identified and 5% for additional team
members over the next 18 months. This aligns with market standards for seed
rounds and ensures we have enough to attract top talent without over-diluting
existing shareholders. We're open to discussing specific concerns you may have
about our hiring plan."

  7. **Distinguish Genuine Interest**

**VC:** "We're interested in investing, but we'd need you to find a lead
investor first," or "We'd like to commit, contingent on you raising the rest
of the round."

VCs often use these tactics to keep their options open without fully
committing. They're expressing interest but aren't ready to take the lead or
make a firm commitment.

**Founder’s Reply:** "We appreciate your interest in our company. We're
currently focusing on investors who are ready to commit without contingencies.
Once we secure our lead investor, we'll reach out if there's still room in the
round. In the meantime, would you be open to introducing us to any potential
lead investors in your network?"

This response politely acknowledges their interest while prioritizing more
committed investors. It also leaves the door open for future participation and
potentially leverages their network.

That’s it.

##### **QUICK DIVES**

Antler has shared a cheat sheet to help founders assess their ability to raise
capital in their initial funding round -

When it comes to fundraising, two factors can make all the difference: Founder
pedigree and Traction.

**1️⃣ Founder Pedigree:** The less traction you have, the more your background
matters. Investors look at your past to assess whether you can deliver in the
future. It's about limiting execution risk.

This isn't necessarily rational. Great founders get overlooked because they
don't fit the typical pattern. But with thousands of similar opportunities,
it's a real filter for investors.

**2️⃣ Traction:** Traction beats pedigree. When you present more than just an
idea on paper and your product has gained some traction, your ability to raise
increases. Lower-profile founders can raise funds when their idea becomes more
than just an idea.

Some factors can change the game.

  * "Levelling up cheats" move you one field to the right in the fundraising matrix, potentially increasing your chances. These might include factors like having a strong co-founder, industry expertise, or unique insights. 

  * "Handicaps" move you one field left, possibly making fundraising more challenging. These could be factors like lack of relevant experience or a difficult-to-explain product.

There are two must-haves without which you won't be able to raise, regardless
of pedigree or traction:

  * Fundraising-ability: You need reasonable fundraising skills. Networking, sales skills, storytelling, and running a tight process are crucial.

  * Market attractiveness: Your market must be significant and attractive. At early stages, it's binary - either investors get excited about the opportunity, or they don't.

Remember

  * Valuations are a function of capital raised. Assume 15-25% dilution irrespective of the amount raised. For example, if a team raises 800k, the valuation will likely be between 3.2m - 5.3m.

  * LinkedIn profile beats pitch deck in very early stages. Many investors will check your LinkedIn before deciding on a first meeting or looking at your pitch deck.

When is this wrong?

  * Numbers are purely directional. They've been validated with experienced investors, but they're not exact.

  * This model is primarily for software startups. Biotech & Hardware companies play by different rules.

  * Copycat models are very binary. Experienced teams can attract large funding, while others struggle to raise anything.

  * Raising from a rich uncle or family/friends who aren't experienced venture investors follows different rules.

Remember, great founders come from all backgrounds. If you don't fit the
"classic" profile, you might need to prove more in the beginning, but there
are countless examples of founders without traditional backgrounds building
awesome companies.

When you learn about entrepreneurship in school you’re taught to have a clear,
strong business plan and financial model when you start out, and to use that
as a way to communicate the path your business will take.

The real world is much messier. Any plan you had when you started gets changed
quickly. Every day or even hour of your time that you devote to your startup
needs to be spent getting it off the ground.

The same is true for a financial model. Your projections will be wildly wrong.

Not only that, but the levers you have at your disposal in the model may not
end up being what you think they’ll be — the entire business may change, and
you likely don’t know enough yet at the pre-seed stage to be sure.

Investors all know this. They see tons of startups and have many first-hand
data points showing that everything can change and often does. What they don’t
know is if YOU know that.

Investors are looking to de-risk the idea of investing in you. Startups are
inherently so risky that they look for ways to think of your startup as less
risky than others. One of those ways is to assess your founder mindset — how
much do you “get” what being a founder will really be like?

The thinking there is that the more you “get” it the more you’ll be able to
anticipate challenges and be emotionally steady when things get rocky.

This is a very common place where first-time founders and founders who don’t
have a strong network fail to build trust with an investor. That might not be
fair, but it’s true. Two of those signals for how well someone is ready to be
a venture-backed founder are:

**How well do they know how to prioritize their time?**

Whether they realize everything will change from their “plan” or not.
Presenting investors with detailed financial projections at the pre-seed stage
fails both of those tests.

Ok… So Why is a Financial Model Useful?

VCs who want to see a model use it as a proxy for understanding whether a
founder can correctly break down the incentives and value levers in a problem
space.

VCs want to trust that if the business needs to change, the founder will be
able to quickly figure out how to evaluate new opportunities and position
their product for success in a new market. It's just a different way of de-
risking an investment opportunity.

The simple takeaway is that each investor is different in what traits they
value and how they reach conviction. So Know your investor - talk to their
backed founders, and read their content. Think about the type of investor you
want as a partner based on their evaluation approach.

When an investor asks you why you need to raise money, the worst thing you can
reply with is that **it’s to extend your runway.**

Investors care about g**rowth and having a clear set of milestones** you think
you can hit. They see a lot of opportunities, and the most exciting ones are
fires that are already growing that they can throw gasoline on top of.

This is similar to how your customer doesn’t care about your product, they
care about the benefit or transformation your product provides for them.

Show them an opportunity that’s growing quickly but could grow faster with
some help, rather than one that needs more money to survive a little longer in
the hopes of striking gold.
