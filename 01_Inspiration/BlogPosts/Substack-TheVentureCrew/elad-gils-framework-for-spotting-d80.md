##### **📜 DEEP DIVE**

Startup history is full of companies that looked like bad ideas at the start.

  * An online marketplace for wedding invitations? Too niche.

  * A payroll tool in a boring, saturated market? Who cares.

  * Another file storage app? Too late.

And yet, those “nonobvious” bets became Minted, Gusto, and Dropbox.

Elad Gil, a longtime operator and investor (Stripe, Coinbase, Instacart,
Airbnb), has a simple thesis:

> Nonobvious markets can lead to hypergrowth, if you know how to spot and
> validate them.

Based on years of experience and interviews with top founders, Gil breaks down
four principles and three market types that help you find overlooked
opportunities with real upside.

Elad’s approach is clear: **Market > Team > Idea.**

Why? Because even great teams can’t escape bad markets. But great markets tend
to give you multiple shots — even if your first idea stumbles.

> “Many great teams get taken out by a terrible market. But if you’re in a
> great market, the idea itself doesn’t matter as much — there are always
> other shots on goal.”  
> – Elad Gil

So before building or investing, study the underlying market structure.

Ask:

  * Is this a growing market with multiple unmet needs?

  * Is it structured like a winner-take-all, or more like an oligopoly?

  * Are existing players actually serving users well?

Most people get this wrong because they fall in love with an idea. Instead,
fall in love with the market.

**1\. Use first principles, not hot takes.**

Don’t just be contrarian for the sake of it. That’s lazy.

Use first principles thinking to ask:

  * Is the “common wisdom” still true?

  * What’s changed in cost, infrastructure, or tech?

  * Has the assumption just aged out?

Example: Payments used to be avoided like the plague. “Too much fraud risk.”  
But then Stripe happened. Fraud tooling, APIs, and internet trust improved and
suddenly it became obvious in hindsight.

**2\. Scratch your own itch — or go deep on real pain.**

Gil’s favorite startups often come from founders solving problems they’ve
lived.

  * Gusto founders had family who struggled with bad payroll tools.

  * Mailgun was built after the team had to manually rebuild the same email infra over and over.

  * Gil’s own startup, Color Genomics, was sparked by his cofounder’s family health history.

This kind of insight gives you edge and a compass.

> “The key is that it’s a real problem. Not an idea you plucked out of thin
> air.”

**3\. Build product-first. Don’t chase vague customer feedback.**

“Would you use this?” is a weak signal.

“Would you pay for this right now?” is a real one.

Break into tough markets with a product that works beautifully, even in
crowded spaces.

  * Dropbox beat bigger incumbents by nailing file syncing.

  * Google flipped the norm by getting users off the site faster, not keeping them longer.

  * Zeplin built what their designer-engineer team wished already existed.

If customers are nodding but not buying, you don’t have it yet.

**4\. Look on the fringe. That’s where the future often starts.**

New trends start weird. Crypto, social media,and online payments all looked
like toys at first.

Gil reminds us:

> “Innovation often comes from small communities screwing around with random
> stuff.”

Pay attention to:

  * What smart people are tinkering with for fun

  * What communities are hacking together without outside attention

  * What you see enthusiasts doing before the mainstream shows up

If you’re looking for overlooked gold, Elad says these are the best hunting
grounds:

**1\. New Tech**

Tech that’s early, misunderstood, or still feels like a toy.

Example: In the 1980s, McKinsey told AT&T the total mobile phone market would
max out at 900,000 users. That was just off by a few billion.

Tip: Survey your smart friends. What are they playing with or obsessing over?

**2\. Looks Crowded, But Isn’t**

Just because a market is noisy doesn’t mean it’s closed.

Gil invested in Checkr and Gusto because he saw startups struggling with those
exact things. If you’re being forced to use a broken tool today, that’s a
startup opportunity.

Think:

  * Google, despite AltaVista and Yahoo

  * Dropbox, despite iCloud and Box

  * Instagram, despite Myspace and Facebook

The trick is to look where incumbents are weak or slow, then wedge in with a
10x better product.

**3\. Seems Niche**

Gil breaks this down into 4 subtypes:

  * **Too small:** Uber started with black cars for rich people. Now it’s infrastructure.

  * **Too boring:** Payroll. On-call alerting. File storage. Huge wins, zero sizzle.

  * **Too high-end:** Tesla’s $100K Roadster seemed like a toy. Now look.

  * **Too personally unfamiliar:** Stitch Fix and Glossier were built from deep user empathy that male investors just didn’t have.

> “Your entry market will almost always seem small. But that’s the point —
> it’s where incumbents aren’t looking.”

Some ideas are great — just not yet.

Gil warns of two patterns:

  * **False starts** : Right idea, bad execution. (Friendster before Facebook)

  * **Boomerangs** : Right idea, wrong timing. (Webvan before Instacart)

Don’t just ask “Is this a good idea?”  
Ask “Is the infrastructure ready? Are customer habits there yet?”

If not — be patient. Timing kills more ideas than bad execution.

So Overall here’s a useful lens to spot your own nonobvious startup:

  * What’s a product or tool you hate but are forced to use?

  * What’s a “boring” problem you or your peers solve manually every month?

  * What’s something your smart friends are excited about but others roll their eyes at?

That’s where you dig.

> “Grab a shovel and dig where it looks weird. That’s usually the spot.”

##### **📄 QUICK WIN**

When you learn about entrepreneurship in school, you’re taught to have a
clear, strong business plan and financial model when you start out, and to use
that as a way to communicate the path your business will take.

The real world is much messier. Any plan you had when you started gets changed
quickly. Every day or even hour of your time that you devote to your startup
needs to be spent getting it off the ground.

The same is true for a financial model. Your projections will be wildly wrong.

Not only that, but the levers you have at your disposal in the model may not
end up being what you think they’ll be — the entire business may change, and
you likely don’t know enough yet at the pre-seed stage to be sure.

Investors all know this. They see tons of startups and have many first-hand
data points showing that everything can change and often does. What they don’t
know is if YOU know that.

Investors are looking to de-risk the idea of investing in you. Startups are
inherently so risky that they look for ways to think of your startup as less
risky than others. One of those ways is to assess your founder mindset — how
much do you “get” what being a founder will really be like?

The thinking there is that the more you “get” it the more you’ll be able to
anticipate challenges and be emotionally steady when things get rocky.

This is a very common place where first-time founders and founders who don’t
have a strong network fail to build trust with an investor. That might not be
fair, but it’s true. Two of those signals for how well someone is ready to be
a venture-backed founder are:

**How well do they know how to prioritise their time?**

Whether they realise everything will change from their “plan” or not.
Presenting investors with detailed financial projections at the pre-seed stage
fails both of those tests.

**Ok… So, Why is a Financial Model Useful?**

VCs who want to see a model use it as a proxy for understanding whether a
founder can correctly break down the incentives and value levers in a problem
space.

VCs want to trust that if the business needs to change, the founder will be
able to quickly figure out how to evaluate new opportunities and position
their product for success in a new market. It’s just a different way of de-
risking an investment opportunity.

The simple takeaway is that each investor is different in what traits they
value and how they reach conviction. So know your investor - talk to their
backed founders, and read their content. Think about the type of investor you
want as a partner based on their evaluation approach.

Validating products means endless iterations and quick launches, right?

Not always.

In some industries, like consumer tech, your reputation means everything. As
Mark Zuckerberg said in The Social Network, “It has to be cool.”

So how do you make a “cool” product without getting a ton of users on it?

**[Nikita Bier](https://x.com/nikitabier)** founded tbh and Gas, grew them to
millions of users, and sold both of them for tens of millions (to Facebook and
Discord, respectively).
