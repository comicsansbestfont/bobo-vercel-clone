If you're a startup founder looking to raise funding, you've likely explored
different investment options like equity, various types of debt, and
[convertible notes](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/the-game-changing-
clause-for-entrepreneur). Typically, these options fall into the categories of
equity or debt instruments. However, there's another choice, SAFE - Simple
Agreement for Future Equity. Unlike traditional instruments, SAFE doesn't fit
neatly into either the debt or equity category, and it doesn't involve
accruing interest.

You might have heard of SAFE, but let me delve deeper into it to explain each
term thoroughly. This way, you'll be well-prepared to approach investors and
raise funds through a SAFE Note in the future.

SAFE takes the legal form of Compulsory Convertible Preference Shares (CCPS)
which is convertible at a future Equity Pricing/ Valuation Round, dissolution,
Merger & Acquisition, or at the end of 3 years from the date of issue,
whichever is earlier

**5 Different Types:**

  * Fixed Conversion at a future date 

  * Valuation Cap, no discount 

  * Discount, no valuation cap 

  * Valuation Cap & Discount 

  * MFN (Most Favored Nation)

Let’s take a simple example:

**Seed Round:**

Let’s say SAFE Investor invests $25,000 with a $5m Valuation Cap, 20% Discount  
**Scenario 1: Series A:**

_**Option 1:**_

  * SAFE Investor Choosing Shares at 20% Discount

  * Share Price= $5*(1-20%) = $4

  * SAFE Investment= $25,000

  * Total Number of Shares = $25,000/ $4= 6,250

 _**Option 2:**_

  * SAFE Investor choosing $5m valuation cap

  * Share Price= $5* ($5m Valuation Cap/ $10m pre-money valuation)= $2.50

  * SAFE Investment= $25,000

  * Total Number of Shares= $25,000/ $2.50= 10,000

  * SAFE Investor will apply the Valuation Cap option; which would convert at $2.50/ share.

  * Finally, the total number of Shares for SAFE Investor= 10,000

  * Share Price at Series A $5

  * Share Value of SAFE Investors= 10,000*$5= $50,000

  * SAFE Investment= $25,000

  * Unrealized Return= (($50,000- $25,000)/ $25,000)* 100%= 100%

**Scenario 2: Series A:**

  * VC Firm Invests at a Pre-Money Valuation = $6 Million

  * Total number of shares 2m

  * Share Price= $6 m/ 2m= $3

 _**Option 1:**_

  * SAFE Investor Choosing Shares at 20% Discount

  * Share Price= $3*(1-20%) = $2.4

  * Total Number of Shares= $25000/ $2.4= 10,417

 _**Option 2:**_

  * SAFE Investor choosing $5m valuation cap

  * Share Price for SAFE Investor= $3* ($5 Million Valuation Cap/ $6 Million pre-money valuation) = $2.5

  * Total Number of Shares= $25,000/ $2.5= 10,000

SAFE Investor will apply the Discount option; which would convert at $2.4/
share.

  * Total number of Shares for SAFE Investor= 10,417

  * Share Price at Series A= $3

  * Share Value of SAFE Investors= 10,417*$3= $31,251

  * SAFE Investment= $25,000

  * Unrealized Return= (($31,251- $25,000)/ 25,000)*100%= 25%

The higher the Valuation Cap in the iSAFE round, the better it is for the
Founder, resulting in a lower dilution of Equity provided the Founders are
confident to close the next round at a higher than the valuation cap.

**MFN Clause:**

  * Let’s say SAFE A has an MFN Provision.

  * If a new SAFE B is issued, the company has to tell SAFE A about it.

  * If the terms of SAFE B are better for the investor than SAFE A, then SAFE A can ask for the same terms as SAFE B.

That’s it, I hope this helps you to understand the SAFE Note. If you need the

I have come across this interesting article - “AI’s $200B Question” where they
mentioned that GPU capacity is getting overbuilt. Long-term, this is good. But
in the short term, things could get messy. So sharing the summary and my takes
on this article.

“In the fast-paced world of AI, the recent surge in Generative AI, spurred by
Nvidia's impressive earnings, has shifted the industry into high gear. Notable
consumer launches like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, alongside
Nvidia's success, have ignited massive investments in GPUs and AI training.

_Source: https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/follow-the-gpus-perspective/_

However, a critical question looms:

`what's the end goal for all these GPUs? Who benefits, and how much value
needs to be created to justify this frenzy?`

**Consider this:** ‘For every $1 spent on a GPU, $1 must be spent on energy
costs. With Nvidia's projected $50B GPU revenue, it implies $100B in data
center expenses. Plus, end users like Starbucks, Tesla, and others need to
earn a margin, making the total revenue requirement astronomical. Much of this
expenditure comes from tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Meta, raising
concerns about whether these investments align with genuine customer demand or
are speculative.’

Although companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Meta, and others are
generating significant AI revenues, there's still a substantial gap to fill.
This creates a massive opportunity for startups to innovate and create genuine
value for end customers. The focus needs to shift from infrastructure to
creating products that people love, use daily, and are willing to pay for.
With the infrastructure in place, the challenge now lies in harnessing AI's
power to change lives, emphasizing customer satisfaction as the key to
success.”
