##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

This one’s a little different. Normally, we break down topics and share
insights, but today we’re giving you something bigger: **a massive database of
investors.** Some of these lists we found online, others we painstakingly
curated with the Venture Curator team. We’ve double-checked everything to make
sure it’s accurate, and we hope it makes your fundraising journey easier.

Before diving in, feel free to check out our previous fundraising tips on the
[Archive Page](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/35-investor-databases-
for-easier#).

Here’s what’s inside each database:

**Here we go: The Ultimate Investor Databases for Free**

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

After I published '[How to Talk About Valuation Numbers When Investors
Ask?](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/how-to-talk-valuation-numbers-
with)', many founders DMed me asking for more content on this topic,
specifically about the common mistakes founders make when discussing
valuation. So I thought I’d share some thoughts on that.

There’s one slide that almost every founder gets wrong when they are putting
together a pitch deck to raise money from venture capitalists. The slide is
usually known as “the ask,” and it typically lives toward the end of the pitch
deck.

> It is meant to do something pretty straightforward: Explain how much money a
> startup is raising and for what. It shouldn’t be rocket science, but it’s
> almost universally a struggle to get right.

Here are the most common mistakes:

  1. Forgetting to include the slide altogether.

  2. Not naming a specific dollar amount you are raising.

  3. Including a valuation on the slide.

  4. Omitting what the funds will be used for.

  5. Listing a specific runway, i.e., “This will keep us running for 18 to 24 months.”

**Include the slide**

Obviously, the easiest way to fail on this slide is to forget to include it
altogether. That’s a mistake. The whole purpose of doing a fundraising process
is to raise money, so you may as well go all-in with a clear ask.

**Name a specific dollar amount**

Quite a few founders are against including any amount at all.

The logic, they argue, is that there are so many different ways to build the
company. If they raise $3 million, they go down one path. If they are able to
raise $5 million, they go down another. If the fundraising doesn’t go as
smoothly as they hoped, and they’re only able to scrape together $1.5 million,
they’ll make that work, too.

It’s good to be scrappy and adaptable as a founder, but you need a Plan A:
What, in your opinion, is the right amount of money to raise to get the
company to the next stage of growth and the next round of funding? Of course,
it’s possible that your lead investor wants to push you toward raising more or
less than that, but you need to have a solid picture of how you’re going to
get from where you are today to where you want to go.

Don’t list a range. Don’t mention that you have 28 different plans for how to
make your company successful. The investors are going to want to see that you
can be decisive and strategic. Make your Plan A, stick a dollar amount on it,
and put that dollar amount on your “ask” slide.

In other words: If you are raising a seed round now, think about what you need
to prove to your investors to be able to raise a Series A next. Map all of
that out and determine what resources you need to get there. That’s how much
money you need if everything goes to plan. Add 30% to 70% as a safety buffer
(depending on how good your planning is and how predictable your business is),
and that’s how much money you need to raise.

**Don’t include a valuation**

Another common mistake I see is that founders include the terms of an
investment, or the valuation, on a slide. If you put “raising $5 million at a
$20 million valuation” on the slide before you have a lead investor, you’re
making a mistake. You may have an opinion for what valuation you are hoping
for, of course, but that will come out as part of the negotiation later on.
The amount of money you need is fixed-ish; what you are willing to give up in
order to raise those funds is not.

In the best-case scenario, you find two or three lead investors who end up in
a bidding war for the privilege of investing in you. The levers they have
available aren’t just the valuation of the company, of course there are plenty
of other clauses that are up for negotiation in a funding process.

The one exception to this is if you already have a lead investor and you’re
just looking to close out the round. In that case, your “ask” slide can
include the name of the lead investor and the terms agreed upon. “Raising $5
million at a $20 million valuation, and Investor X has committed $3 million of
the round” can work.

Having said that, if you’re that far into your funding round, there’s probably
enough inertia to close out the round; it’s unlikely to be necessary to update
this slide once you have a signed term sheet in hand.

**Explain what the funds will be used for**

You’re running a startup, and you’re going to want to raise money to
accomplish something. Makes sense. What doesn’t make any sense at all is how
many founders seem to be shy about sharing the details of the plan. A lot of
the due diligence process is going to be focused on figuring out whether you
are a competent, believable founder and showing that you have a detailed plan
and vision for what’s going to happen over the next stretch of time.

**Put differently:** If I’m going to invest $2 million into your startup, I
want to know what that money buys me, in terms of progress for your company.

Ideally, your company has an operating plan as part of the pitch deck, which
goes into detail about what is going to happen between this and the next
funding round. On the “ask” slide, however, you have the opportunity to
summarize in three or four bullet points what you’re going to do with the
money.

**Typically, you’re going to want to include product, traction, market
validation and key hire milestones.**

  * **Product** — What product milestones do you need to hit in order to raise the next tranche of money? In particular, this includes beta or full product launches, major feature sets in the product pipeline or integrations with partners.

  * **Traction** — What business metrics do you need to achieve to raise more money? How many units do you have to sell, how many subscribers do you need, how many customers do you want? Other metrics may also be helpful here your net promoter score (NPS), monthly active users, etc.

  * **Market validation** — What can you do to prove that there’s a real market out there willing to pay for the product or service you are peddling?

  * **Key hires** — To reach the above goals, you probably need to hire. How many people do you need to hire? When?

Each of these goals should be SMART: specific, measurable, achievable,
relevant and time-based. Poor goals are vague: “Improve marketing,” “Get more
customers” or “Add features to our product.”

Examples of great SMART goals:

  * “By Jan 2025, we need 2,000 paying customers on our recurring subscription model.”

  * “In the next six months, we need to reduce our customer acquisition cost by 20%.”

  * “Our B2B sales need to improve, so by July we are aiming to hire an experienced VP of sales who can help shape our sales processes.”

Be. Specific.

**Never mind the timeline, talk about the milestones**

As we hinted at above, it’s important to list the milestones you believe you
need to achieve to raise the next round of funding. Note that this is
milestone-driven; each goal unlocks the next part of the journey. But that
doesn’t mean that you’re explicitly talking about time.

You are not raising money to get 18 months of runway. You are raising money to
hit a certain set of milestones. If you can do that in 12 months, then you
raise your next round of funding in a year. If you need 24 months, that’s OK,
too. Don’t get too hung up on the timeline; some things take more time than
you might expect. That makes sense; this is a startup nothing ever goes to
plan.

The corollary of this is that you need to bake enough wiggle room into your
plans. If you expect something to take 18 months, but it takes 24, it’s a
really poor look if you run out of money in month 19.

**Remember -**

The “ask” slide is one of the most painful slides to get wrong because it
shows that you aren’t a very good founder. Perhaps you’re a great technical
co-founder, a brilliant salesperson or an incredible marketer, and that’s
great but the job of the founder is to have a specific, actionable, reasonable
plan in place to navigate through choppy waters.

Having a poor “ask and use of funds” slide is a huge red flag to many
investors. After all, investors have a conga line of smart, talented folks
coming through the door day in and day out.

To stand out, you can’t just be good at marketing, sales, development or any
of the other aspects of running a business. You have to be good at the _art_
of running the business, too and this is one of the slides where you get to
show off and prove that you know what you’re doing. Don’t waste that
opportunity.

One of the biggest mistakes first-time founders make is building a product too
early before they’ve understood the problem they’re trying to solve.

They get excited after a few customer interviews, feel like they’ve uncovered
a massive gap in the market, and dive into building. Sometimes they even get
early traction. But too often, the foundation is shaky based on biased
assumptions, shallow validation, and a misunderstanding of what the real
problem is.

If you skip this step, nothing else matters. You might be solving a symptom
not the actual problem. Solving a symptom only gives you a short-term win, not
a sustainable business.

Chris Myers, co-founder of BodeTree, puts it perfectly:

> "If you react instinctively and without deep thought, you’ll find yourself
> mistaking that symptom for the problem itself."

This happens more than we think. A founder sees friction in a process and
immediately jumps to fix it without asking why that friction exists in the
first place.

This method, developed by Toyota’s Taiichi Ohno, is simple but powerful. Just
keep asking why until you get to the root of the issue. It might take three or
five rounds of questioning, but eventually, the real cause shows up.

This isn't just useful for startups it applies to digital projects, internal
tools, even operational bottlenecks. Every business problem deserves this
level of clarity.

Most founders have read The Lean Startup. But reading is not the same as
doing.

You need to rigorously test your assumptions, especially around the **need**
for what you're building. Just because someone says, _“That’s interesting”_ ,
doesn’t mean they’d pay for it or even use it.

Steve Jobs didn’t just wake up and decide people wanted touchscreen phones. He
and his team spent over two years unravelling unmet needs before launching the
iPhone. They didn’t build what people said they wanted they built what solved
the real need.

  * **False validation** : You talk to a few people, get positive feedback, and assume you’re on to something big. But unless people are actively hacking together their own solution or willing to pay, it’s not real validation.

  * **Confirmation bias** : You fall in love with your idea and look for anything that supports it. This clouds your judgment and makes you ignore red flags.

  * **Ignoring the customer journey** : Even if your solution has clear benefits, have you considered what the customer has to give up? Time? Familiar habits? Money? New behaviours? If you don’t understand the trade-offs, you’re missing key context.

Once you’ve validated that a real problem exists and that people care deeply
enough to want it solved you can start designing and testing solutions. This
is where build-measure-learn makes sense.

Don’t waste cycles building a product for a problem you don’t fully
understand. Start with clarity, then iterate.

You’ll move faster by moving smarter.

Henry Ford’s quote still applies:

> “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster
> horses.”

People didn’t ask for a car. They wanted to get from A to B faster. Ford
solved the actual problem, not the request.

That's the shift in mindset you need. What are your customers _really_ trying
to do? What outcomes matter to them? If you can define those clearly, you can
start innovating around them not just building features.

Every time a customer adopts something new, they’re giving something up time,
money, effort, and familiarity.

Your solution needs to deliver more value than the status quo. That’s the only
way they’ll switch. And the only way you’ll build something that lasts.
