“Wearing A Black Turtleneck Doesn’t Make You Steve Jobs!”

When it comes to building a startup you’re never doing it entirely from
scratch. Inspiration and ideas can come from a variety of places, including
other successful startups.

But there’s a thin line between borrowing smart ideas and copying them blindly
- otherwise known as Cargo Culting.

In simple words, **Cargo Culting** is copying something without understanding
why you're copying it. That’s where most founders fall into the trap. Even in
recent times, startups are following blindly other AI startups that are not
even successful because they raise millions of dollars.

If you are wondering about the **[Cargo
Culting](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cargo_culting#:~:text=cargo%20culting%20\(uncountable\),properly%20analysing%20and%20understanding%20it.)**
word - This term originated from the practice of creating fake landing strips
to attract aeroplanes without understanding the reasons for the attraction.

`In the classic variety of cargo cutting, the founder’s mentality is “It's
just I'm going to copy something, don't know why but I'm going to copy it and
then I will be as successful as the thing I'm copying.” Almost all founders
think this.`

However, in the modern new age of Cargo Culting, there is a question of
whether the thing being copied is worth copying at all. This one misses some
obvious aspects because they don't deeply understand the product they are
copying.

If you look at some of the companies that had classically covered Culting:

**In 2000, Every Startup Was Obsessed With Google.**

“Everyone seemed fixated on Google's practices – whether you were the next
Google or striving to emulate their success. Ideas, good or not, were trained
to lean towards mimicking what Google did.

The most apparent trend was replicating their office culture: open spaces,
bright colours, and free snacks. **This "Googly" vibe became a benchmark for
startups,** as if mirroring Google's office culture was the key to real
success.

The absence of traditional offices, the flat organizational structure, and the
mantra of hiring as many smart engineers as possible were also part of this
emulation.

Even down to the details like cute startup names with dropped vowels and logos
reminiscent of Google's style, complete with lens flares, were considered
crucial. In the pursuit of building the world's best search engine, it became
evident that replicating Google's office culture and aesthetics played a vital
role.”

“They're the pioneers of going viral. So for every startup founder/investor
“going viral” became the question and everyone tried to follow Facebook’s
playbook without thinking this copy was good or bad.

Also, Facebook **introduced the concept of the share button** – a must-have on
everything. Another classic from Facebook was avoiding direct user revenue and
focusing on building a massive user base, then transitioning into an ads
business.

This was the mantra, universally accepted – follow the Facebook Playbook,
regardless of the business type. Charging users was frowned upon; the goal was
to accumulate vast user data. The prevailing belief was that privacy didn't
matter, a notion blindly followed by many without thinking it was right or
wrong.”

“It all started with the notion of spending as much money as possible – a
strategy that, amusingly, became a key takeaway.

The concept of cargo cutting emerged, where people imitated Uber's actions
without understanding the reasons behind them. Uber did well in what it did,
but the folly lay in blindly copying its superficial actions – scaling without
comprehension, burning through funds, ignoring laws, and neglecting unit
economics.

The desire to be like Uber led to some rather silly endeavours by those who
didn't truly grasp the essence of Uber's success.”

**The most interesting thing is that all these startups** \- Google, Facebook
or Uber worked very well and are pioneers today but the startup that followed
Cargo cutting just died in a few years. So what makes these three startup to
be pioneers?

Because - they knew what they were doing without copying/following the Cargo
Culting strategy.

**For Google** , hiring really smart people was crucial because they were
tackling a challenging problem. Before Google, there was a misconception that
search was a commodity, but Google proved otherwise with its technical
breakthroughs. They hired talented engineers after the dot-com bubble crash,
making perfect sense in a historical context.

**Facebook's decision not to charge users** but to focus on building an ad
business made sense for their scale. However, blindly copying their playbook
didn't lead to the same success. Going viral, a great strategy for Facebook,
might not work for everyone. It's easier when users spend hours daily on your
platform, unlike products with shorter usage times.

**Uber's common beliefs** were often inaccurate. Investors funded markets with
good unit economics, not ones burning money. Copying Uber's expansion strategy
without understanding market dynamics didn't work. Uber succeeded because it
provided immediate value, not by superficial imitation. Replicating success is
challenging; it requires genuine understanding and smart execution.

`So “Wearing A Black Turtleneck Doesn’t Make You Steve Jobs or Successful like
Apple.” If you are copying someone, the most important thing to understand is
whether it’s good or bad.`

Also even if you look at current AI hype, What worries me more with the surge
in valuations is - founders copying companies that haven't succeeded yet.
It**'s alarming when founders adopt strategies simply because a company raised
a significant round or gained attention.**

When I asked about some companies in pitching, the common response is often "I
have no idea." As a CEO, betting your **company's strategy on limited
information** from fundraising announcements or podcast interviews seems
risky.

Copying something that's working might bring luck, but copying something
that's not working is questionable. **The inflated valuations seem to have
skewed perceptions.** Assuming a company is successful just because investors
value it at a billion dollars is misguided.

`I've seen many influenced by the likes of WeWork or Zoom Pizza, blindly
copying strategies based on fundraising rather than business success.`

Unfortunately, this often leads to flameouts for the founders who followed
such trends.

Interestingly, there's a growing trend among startups where they engage in
modern cargo quilting. **The focus shifts towards the superficial – how the
startup appears to others.** It's all about the logos, as we discussed
earlier.

Founders feel the need to mimic other startups to create a certain perception.
The superficial checklist includes raising money, having notable advisors, and
even getting a patent. A killer pitch deck becomes crucial, along with the
ability to pitch the company anywhere. Attending conferences and securing
press coverage are deemed essential. **These are actions taken by founders not
necessarily for the users but to impress themselves and other founders.**

It's all about creating a startup image that aligns with what's perceived as
successful.

`The key takeaway here is that while innovation is important, it's also
crucial to recognize the value of learning from existing successful companies.
`

Founders should begin by understanding what users want and identify the
companies that users are currently paying for similar services. By studying
these successful companies, founders can gain valuable insights.

**It's essential to view the business through the eyes of the user.** For
example, do users prioritize the Google logo, or do they value getting
accurate search results quickly? Similarly, for Facebook, is the focus on the
platform itself or on staying connected with friends and receiving timely
updates? When founders prioritize understanding user needs, they are more
likely to make essential decisions.

`Starting with a user-centric approach avoids getting caught up in superficial
details and allows for a more meaningful assessment of what truly matters to
the users. `

This user-focused mindset is a more effective way to navigate the complexities
of building a successful business compared to starting with fundraising
announcements, which can be challenging and may lead to overlooking the core
aspects that drive user satisfaction.

So overall - Don’t follow Cargo Culting….

##### **FEATURED TWEET**

"The typical market-size slide is obsolete." VC Partner. Why?

Market slide often misses the mark due to a standardized approach by pitch
coaching. This template mandates the inclusion of **TAM, SAM, and SOM in three
bubbles**.

It’s clear why entrepreneurs try to pump up their market size. They’ve been
told that VC is only interested in unicorns, and so they assume that the best
way to become a unicorn is to go for the largest market… **[Read More
