##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

When you are launching a two-sided platform, you need supply and demand. And
it creates a big problem for founders, putting a high barrier to entry. You
need to find not just users, but two different types of users (which is x2
times harder).

Users on one side of the business model find the platform useful only if the
other side also exists.

For example, people buy video game consoles only if there are games they can
play. Game developers make games for a console only if there are enough people
who use it.

A lot of founders have this question- How to solve The Chicken and Egg
problem? So We have reviewed several very popular marketplaces, that everybody
knows to show how they successfully addressed this issue.

Everybody heard about Tinder. Today (in 2024) Tinder facilitates over 13
million matches daily. But how it was in the first days of service? How did
they overcome the nightmare of all marketplaces? Here is an interesting story
behind it.

  1. Whitney Wolfe, Co-Founder of Tinder, packed her suitcase and set off to travel around the country.

  2. In each city, she made a presentation to the women's communities, motivating them to register in the app, and explaining how it's cool and useful.

  3. Then she gave presentations to male communities, showing the app that is full of those local girls, who already registered.

  4. When Whitney returned from a trip, 15,000 first users already used the application.

> “Her pitch was pretty genius. She would go to chapters of her sorority, do
> her presentation, and have all the girls at the meetings install the app.
> Then she’d go to the corresponding brother fraternity—they’d open the app
> and see all these cute girls they knew...”
>
> [coder Angel Munoz](https://medium.com/message/how-tinder-co-founder-
> whitney-wolfe-hacked-metcalfes-law-f607dddbde66).

In 2014 Whitney left Tinder and founded Bumble (the biggest competitor of
Tinder).

Dating? This girl knows how to make money on it.

Today Airbnb is a huge company with a $95B valuation. But in 2008 they were
just starting with an idea of air beds and breakfasts for strangers. And like
all marketplaces, they faced The Chicken and Egg problem:

How did Airbnb get out of the situation? (it’s already a legendary example)

  1. They created a script that scanned all landlord’s offers on Craigslist and collected their emails.

  2. Then the same script sent a letter on behalf of a pretty young girl who "liked the apartment so much" and asked the owner to add his apartment to Airbnb.

  3. So Airbnb quickly acquired 60,000 first landlords, which solved The Chicken and Egg problem.

What’s more, they [made](https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/airbnb) it
easy for users to post listings on Craigslist through Airbnb with one click.

Later Craigslist closed this backdoor for collecting emails, but the main idea
in the approach. If you need first users, you can simply copy them from
somewhere. Besides, such holes appear regularly at many services. You just
need to check such opportunities.

Uber’s story began in Paris in 2008. Two friends, Travis Kalanick and Garrett
Camp, were attending the LeWeb, an annual tech conference the Economist __
describes as “where revolutionaries gather to plot the future".

Rumour has it that the concept for Uber was born one winter night during the
conference when the pair was unable to get a cab. Initially, the idea was for
a timeshare limo service that could be ordered via an app. After the
conference, the entrepreneurs went their separate ways, but when Camp returned
to San Francisco, he continued to be fixated on the idea and bought the domain
name UberCab.com.

To get their first drivers, Travis cold-called black car drivers and offered
to pay them an hourly rate while they tried out the platform. 3 of the 10
drivers that he called, agreed to give it a try.

Then, to incentivize passengers, they offered free rides at local events in
the tech-savvy San Francisco community and worked hard to make each experience
the best it could be. According to Kalanick, word of mouth was the biggest
driver of sales and Uber spent almost nothing on traditional marketing.

> _“I’m talking old school word of mouth, you know at the water cooler in the
> office, at a restaurant when you’re paying the bill, at a party with friends
> — ‘Who’s Ubering home?’ 95% of all our riders have heard about Uber from
> other Uber riders.”_
>
>  _— Travis Kalanick_
>
>  _“When someone sees the ease of use, the fact that they press a button on
> their phone and in under 5 minutes a car appears, they inevitably become a
> brand advocate.”_
>
>  _—[Max J. Crowley , Business Development at
> Uber](https://www.quora.com/How-did-Uber-capture-local-markets-How-did-they-
> gain-and-maintain-traction-once-there/answer/Max-J-Crowley)_

**Entering new markets.**  
Since Uber’s main competition was taxicab companies, the startup researched
which cities had the biggest discrepancy between supply and demand for taxis.
They then launched during times when that demand was likely to be the highest,
for example during the holidays when people tend to stay out late partying. It
also ran promotions during large concerts or sporting events, when big crowds
of people all needed cabs at the same time, and an individual might be more
likely to take a chance on an unfamiliar company named Uber.

In that way, the company acquired a large group of customers in one swoop.
“First, they figured out how to get a bunch of customers all in one night,
when the demand was high. Then, they made sure this first group of users had a
great experience and brought in the next wave of customers via word-of-mouth,”
says Teixeira. The company banked on the fact that once users realized how
easy it was, it was only a matter of time before they started using it to go
to work, then shopping for groceries, and so on.

Launching in situations of high demand and low supply also helps startups
acquire the right type of customers—those early adopters who might be more
forgiving of a company while it works out the kinks.

Besides the fact that you need first users (and you see that startups use
different hacks how to get these users on the board, creativity should help
you overcome this problem too), you have to satisfy these users with your
service.

> It can be quality, speed, usability, great support, etc. A long list of
> possible options. But the main idea - make your customers really happy.

Some founders say that getting your idea off the ground “it's a numbers game”.
But it’s not. It’s a way how you treat your first customers. Do they stay
happy by sharing your link with all their friends, or writing a 1-star review
in App Store?

Paul Graham, Co-Founder of Y Combinator, wrote a famous essay

“[Do things that don’t scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html)” where he
described all the main things for early-stage startups. He said:

“All you need from a launch is some initial core of users. How well you’re
doing a few months later will depend more on how happy you made those users
than how many there were of them.”

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

“Your North Star Metric is your strategy, and your strategy is your North Star
Metric.” Many first-time founders make mistakes in choosing the right metrics
for their startups. Even some don’t have a clear idea about it and picked the
wrong North Star metrics. Remember with your north star metrics, investors
predict how you are thinking about the future. So it’s important to choose the
right one.

It’s a single metric which can align the entire company around an overarching
mission whilst simultaneously reflecting the value being delivered to
customers.

Look at the mission statements of two of the world’s best-known companies,
Google and LinkedIn:

> Google – “Google’s mission is to organise the world’s information and make
> it universally accessible and useful”
>
> LinkedIn – “Connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive
> and successful.”

**The goal of the North Star Metric is to quantify this mission and express it
in a way that can be measured and tracked**. It is often used as a guiding
light for the entire company to rally around – a sort of special key
performance indicator (KPI).

**What is a good North Star Metric?**

> Which metric, if it were to increase today would accelerate business
> flywheel? - Lenny Rachitsky

Here are some best practices for deciding on a good North Star metric:

  1. Is it measurable?

  2. It is simple, memorable and easily understood?

  3. Is it a leading (not lagging) indicator of success?

  4. Does it help your customers reach _their_ end goal?

  5. Does it apply to all customers and does it add value to all customers?

**What is a bad North Star Metric?**

There are also some poor metrics to use as a north star, the most common of
which is revenue. Below are some characteristics you should aim to avoid when
deciding on a north star metric:

  * Lagging indicators that show past performance, not future potential.

  * Metrics are hard for employees to influence or understand their impact on.

  * Metrics do not reflect customer value delivery, like vanity metrics.

  * Generic metrics that don't represent your unique business strategy.

Your north star **should be unique** to your business (or at the least your
business niche) and should be **an indicator of the problem you solve** for
customers, and t**he value provided to them.**

Below we have provided examples of North Star metrics from many well-known
brands. Notice how they are not all perfect, but generally, all reflect value
delivered to the market.

So while choosing metrics for your startup remember - “North Star Metrics - if
this metric grows, all other metrics will be growing too. Such as engagement,
acquisition, and sales.” - Adam Wright.

[Jeff Chang](https://x.com/jeffchang30) shared an interesting article where he
talks about why LTV/CAC is not a good metric for new startups. I found it very
interesting, so I'm sharing a summary and my thoughts on this.

LTV/CAC (Lifetime Value divided by Customer Acquisition Cost) is a popular way
to measure if your advertising money is well spent.

> “LTV/CAC, or Customer Lifetime Value to Customer Acquisition Cost, is a
> metric that measures how effective a business's marketing efforts are and
> how profitable it will be in the long term.
>
> It's calculated by dividing the customer lifetime value (LTV) by the
> customer acquisition cost (CAC).”

While big companies use it successfully, it's not very helpful for startups.
Here's why:

Main Problems with LTV/CAC for Startups:

**Problem 1**

Startup Survival Reality Most companies assume customers will stick around for
3-10 years when calculating LTV. But here's the truth: many startups don't
even last that long. When your startup might not survive for several years,
those long-term customer value calculations become meaningless.

**Problem 2:**

Customer Acquisition Changes Over Time

  * Early success can be misleading

  * Example: You might spend $1 to make $3 with your first ads

  * But when you try to scale up (like spending $1 million), the profits don't scale the same way

  * Why? Because:

    * Early customers are usually easier to get

    * Ad platforms find cheaper customers first

    * Target audiences get saturated

**Problem 3:**

The Data Problem New startups face a critical issue: they simply don't have
enough data. Without years of customer history, it's impossible to make
accurate predictions about:

  * How long customers will stay

  * How much they'll spend over time

  * Whether current customers behave like future ones

  * How product changes affect customer behaviour

**Problem 4:**

Resource Drain Getting accurate LTV/CAC numbers isn't simple. It requires:

  * Hiring data analysts or scientists

  * Breaking down different customer types

  * Creating complex prediction models

  * Constant updates and monitoring

**A Better Solution:** Focus on the Payback Period

What is the Payback Period? - It's simply how quickly you get back the money
you spent on ads through revenue. This works better for startups because it's
more immediate and practical.

**How to Use Payback Period:**

**Simple Way to Judge Success:**

  * Good Example: Spend $1,000 on ads → Make $1,000 in the first month

  * Bad Example: Spend $1,000 on ads → Make $500 first month, $300 second month, etc.

  * Rule of Thumb: If it's not clearly profitable right away, it might not be worth your time

Don't get caught up in complex metrics just because big companies use them.
For startups, the rule is simple: if your ads aren't making money quickly
(ideally within 6 months or less), focus your energy elsewhere. You want
advertising that pays for itself fast, not promises of long-term returns that
might never materialize.

Nowadays - It's pretty common for companies to claim they've nailed product-
market fit when, in reality, they're quite far from it. I'd argue this is a
major cause of downfall, especially for post-seed companies.

Many founders often face a dilemma where they believe that they have achieved
product-market fit based on some factor, but honestly, it’s just a "Fake
Product-Market Fit." What are those factors?

  1. Firstly, some founders believe they've hit the jackpot **when they secure funding from impressive individuals or renowned funds.** The thought is that if these influential people or funds chose their company, it must mean they have product-market fit. This belief is surprisingly widespread.

  2. Secondly, there's a trend where **companies manage to raise substantial amounts** , even before having a product that people truly love. Interestingly, instead of focusing on users and improving the product, founders often shift their focus to building the company, which is usually not the best move.

  3. Thirdly, there's this phenomenon we call "**magical thinking** ". It involves **ignoring obvious facts** or not bothering to measure crucial metrics that would reveal whether product-market fit exists. For instance, not understanding churn or the payback period after acquiring a customer. If you're not aware of these numbers, it's **easy to convince yourself that you've achieved product-market fit** **when you haven't.**

  4. Lastly, there's a tendency for people to delude themselves into thinking they've achieved product-market fit simply because **they don't want to face the idea that they might need better engineering or product improvement**. Admitting that improving the product is challenging, they find it easier to just believe their product is already good.

Most of the founders fell into this trap of ‘Fake Product Market Fit’. Not
only this - one of the most common misconceptions is that

“Product-Market Fit Means Only You've To Build A Product That Your Users Want.

In reality - Product-market fit typically feels like your product is gaining
traction with profitable usage.

”your product is attracting users, and word of mouth or advertising channels
are working well. Users love your product, and they're sticking around.  

However, there's a catch.

Parts of your product that you didn't build to scale are starting to break. It
could be software components or operational aspects, but something is
faltering because it wasn't designed for this level of success.”

**You might be thinking what’s this profitable usage about?**

“It means these users are the ones you want, and economically, they make
sense. You're not spending a lot for a user who only brings in a fraction of
that cost. There's no crazy three-year payback period or anything like that.

So, for genuine product-market fit, we need both of these components:

  1. a product that's breaking in a good way due to increased usage

  2. users who align with the economics you desire.

To achieve genuine product-market fit, founders need to determine if they have
a real connection between their product and the market, instead of a fake one.
