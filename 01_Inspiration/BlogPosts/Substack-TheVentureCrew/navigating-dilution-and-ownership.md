Startup fundraising can be a complex and challenging process, especially when
it comes to dilution and the resulting impact on founder and company
ownership. However, with a deep understanding of how dilution works and
careful planning, founders can maintain control of their company and stay true
to their vision while still securing the funding they need to succeed. By
unlocking the secrets of startup fundraising, founders can ensure that they
are well-equipped to navigate the challenges and emerge victorious in their
entrepreneurial journey.

This blog will help you understand dilution in a more nuanced manner.

In simple words, Dilution is the reduction in shareholders' equity positions
due to the creation of new shares i.e. addition of new shareholders like
investors. Let's understand the whole story with one **example (with some
assumptions):**  

Suppose -

The founder's pre-raise equity value (PEV) = 100% or 1

Employed Stock Option Pool (ESOP) = 15% or 0.15

The pre-money valuation of the company = $4M and an investor is willing to put
$1M in this startup.

So,

% of equity dilution = Investment Amount / (Pre-money valuation + Investment
Amount)

So - In this case - % of equity dilution = $1M / ($4M + $1M) = 0.20 * 100 =
20%

So, 20% of equity will be diluted (will get to the investor) from the total
equity that the founder has.

So, let's calculate the current equity founder have after raising funds.

**Total Founder Ownership Factor (TFOF) =**

(1 - 0.15 (ESOP)) * (1 - 0.2 (equity dilution)) = 0.68 = 68% (Ownership of
founder).

Hence , Dilution = (1-0.68) = 0.32 = 32% (This is for the ESOP & Investors)

I hope this article helped you understand the dilution for startup founders
after raising a fund from any investors.

While raising your early funding for your startup, make sure to do your own
calculation this will give you more conviction while talking with investors.
