##### **THE MOST EMERGING STARTUP YOU CAN'T-MISS**

Ever had one of those moments **when you're explaining the same task to your
VA for the fifth time** and think 'There has to be a better way!'? (Trust me,
I've been there! )

**Meet[A Team Overseas](https://www.ateamoverseas.com/venture-crew/)** \-
they're flipping the virtual assistance game on its head. While those fancy
agencies charge $3K/month but pay EAs only $700, these folks said 'enough!'
They're snagging top EAs, paying them $1,400 (finally, fair pay!), and
charging clients just $2.5K.

But here's what made me jump out of my chair - these aren't just task-takers.
My friend Sarah's EA caught a major sales funnel issue and fixed it before
Sarah even noticed. No more endless training, just pure magic!

##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

When talking to investors, you’re answering the what (product), why (mission),
where (if relevant) and how (strategy and go-to-market).

But founders often ignore another important question: Why now?

The answer is often related to something that is shifting and changing, either
in the market or with the technology layer. Anchoring your company with a good
“Why now?” slide is a great addition to your story.

**Successful companies usually have these things in common:**

They were the right company, solving the right problem at the right time.
Think of all the startups that cropped up during the early years of the
pandemic that were solving specific problems related to accessing health care
or presenting meetings.

Showing that you know why you’re launching now as opposed to any other time
will create a sense of urgency:

> Investors won’t want to miss out on a business that’s solving what they see
> as an immediate problem. It’s your job to highlight the ways your company
> can address those issues and why now is the right time to do so.

It’s often possible to see some significant market trends converging, but when
it comes to timing, you’re trying to read the future.

In the words of Wayne Gretzky (Ice hockey player), you want to be skating to
where the puck will be, not where the puck is.

**The “Why now?” question can be answered in several ways,** but it usually
boils down to at least one of these three things:

  * technology timing,

  * market timing or

  * regulatory timing.

Think about consumer-grade photography drones. Why did they arrive on the
scene when they did?

After all, RC planes and helicopters have been around since the 1970s. Compact
video cameras (such as GoPros) have been around since the early 2000s. It’s
not that the tech didn’t exist; it’s that the technology required was
prohibitively expensive for a consumer-grade piece of equipment.

Apple’s iPhone changed that, though. As smartphones became ubiquitous, small
camera modules, solid-state accelerometers, radio and GPS chipsets all became
dirt cheap, available to hobbyists, and both well documented and hackable.
Once the tech got small and cheap enough, building camera-equipped drones was
a logical next step.

**The most successful startups of our era did three things:**

  * They spotted a trend early and developed a solution to take advantage of that. Google, Facebook and Apple are all good examples here: They weren’t the first search engine, social network or smartphone/computer manufacturers, but they saw an opportunity to make the tech more user-friendly.

  * They were able to build solutions that were better than anything else out there.

  * Then they ended up defining the industries they entered, riding the wave to the top.

You can use your timing narrative to reiterate some of the biggest strengths
of your startup.

You should explain the macro dynamics of your space, how the market is
evolving and how new technological innovations make your company possible when
it wouldn’t have been before.

Remind the investors how changes in regulatory frameworks are opening new
opportunities. That includes demographic shifts (the population as a whole is
ageing); technology shifts (self-driving cars, solar power, electric vehicles,
5G mobile phone networks); market shifts (homeownership numbers, market
boom/bust times); significant changes in how work is done (the gig economy,
working from home, remote-first companies).

Many of these trends are somewhat predictable, and the best startup founders
know how to spot them and leverage them to their advantage.

It’s an opportunity to remind investors how your team has been in this
industry for a long time.

Something like, “I saw all of these shifts happen when I was a VP of
investment banking at Goldman Sachs for 15 years,” is a great way to remind
the investors that you have both experience and in-depth domain knowledge.

The “Why now?” is partially about history, but remember that it’s not a
history lesson; it’s about trends.

You can use past data and innovation to draw a trend line toward the future.
Combine that with what your company is doing and where it is going. The
perfect “why now” slide has a fast-moving puck and a startup moving at
breakneck speed to intercept it where it’s going to be in five years.

This is the sort of thing that makes investors salivate; the world’s most
significant opportunities are high-risk, high-reward movements. Think big and
weave a story of how you are on the right vector to be in the right place at
the right time.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Many founders wonder: How do VCs decide which startups to fund?[ John
Hu](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7188877819613962240/),
who’s worked at top VC firms like Goldman Sachs and Norwest Venture Partners,
shared the exact framework investors use to evaluate startups. He even applied
it to his own startup—here’s how each column was rated:

  * Team: What is the quality of your team? How strong is your “Founder-Market’Fit? Why is your team the best team to solve this problem?

  * Market Size: How large is this market? Does it have BN$+ potential

  * Competition: How competitive is this market?

  * Differentiation: How will you beat the competition? What’s your competitive angle?

  * Metrics: How strong are your metrics? How strong of a growth indication do they give?

  * Exit Potential: How many potential buyers are there of your company?

These are great points that founders can consider to grading their startup,
but there is a simpler way to grade a startup as 'A' or 'C,' as shared by
Herwig Springer -

  * 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗺  
A for taking market feedback over theory.  
C for having outside commitments at play.

  * 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁 𝗦𝗶𝘇𝗲  
A for evidence to support target market cap.  
C for overestimating the accessible market.

  * 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻  
A for having a key competitive advantage.  
C for failing to acknowledge key competitors.

  * 𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻  
A for building strong moats like proprietary technology.  
C for differentiation based on easily replicable factors.

  * 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘀  
A for balancing growth and profitability metrics.  
C for focusing on vanity metrics like sign-ups.

  * 𝗘𝘅𝗶𝘁 𝗣𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹  
A for considering options like M&A.  
C for hyperfocusing on one path.

Try it for your startup. Make sure it will be A for each column.

When an investor asks you why you need to raise money, the worst thing you can
reply with is that it’s to extend your runway.

Investors care about g**rowth and having a clear set of milestones** you think
you can hit. They see a lot of opportunities, and the most exciting ones are
fires that are already growing that they can throw gasoline on top of.

This is similar to how your customer doesn’t care about your product, they
care about the benefit or transformation your product provides for them.

Show them an opportunity that’s growing quickly but could grow faster with
some help, rather than one that needs more money to survive a little longer in
the hopes of striking gold.

If you're a founder with less than ~12 months of runway going into 2025, you
have to re-read Paul Graham’s [The Fatal
Pinch.](https://paulgraham.com/pinch.html) Assume you will NOT get a bridge
round, and figure out what other options you have ASAP.

Let me share a key point that every founder should consider while considering
their burn rate -

“The "fatal pinch" that happens to a lot of startups. It's when they've got
some cash in the bank, but they're bleeding money every month and not growing.
They think they'll be fine 'cause they'll just raise more money from
investors. Big mistake.

The problem is, that **founders often kid themselves about how easy it'll be
to get more funding.** It's way harder the second time around because:

  1. The company's burning through cash faster now

  2. Investors expect a lot more from companies that have already raised money

  3. The startup is starting to look like a failure

This whole situation is like a nasty feedback loop. Founders think they'll
easily raise more money, so they don't try hard enough to become profitable,
which makes it even harder to raise money.

To avoid this mess, YC tells founders to act like the money they raise is the
last they'll ever get. If you're already in the fatal pinch, you've got three
options: shut down, make more money, or spend less (which usually means firing
people).

If you decide to keep going, you need to focus on making more money ASAP. This
might mean changing what you're selling or doing more consulting-type work.
Just be careful not to slide too far into pure consulting.

The good news is, that lots of successful startups have had near-death
experiences and survived. You just gotta realize you're in trouble before it's
too late. If you're in the fatal pinch, you are.”
