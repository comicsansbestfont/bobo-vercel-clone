You read it right - successful startups track LTV/CACD, rather than LTV/CAC,
why? What does D stand for in CACD? Why it’s better to track LTV/CACD than
LTV/CAC? Let’s understand this…

> If you are not aware of these terms -
>
> _**LTV, or Lifetime Value** is the total amount of value a customer brings
> to a business over the entire duration of their relationship._
>
> _**CAC, or Customer Acquisition Cost,** is the amount of money a business
> spends on average to acquire a new customer._
>
> _**The LTV/CAC Ratio** compares the Lifetime Value (LTV) of a customer to
> the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), providing insight into the efficiency
> and sustainability of a business's customer acquisition strategy._
>
> _**LTV/CACD,** by the end of this writeup you will get the idea on this,
> what D stand for in CACD and why it’s right to track LTV/CACD than LTV/CAC._

**A business is an engine** that attracts customers, delivers something of
value to them, and then extracts that value in the form of profits. That’s
what a business is.

Thus it logically follows that the ‘**cost of attracting a new customer needs
to be less than the value we can extract from that customer.** ’ Let’s take a
simple example - If for our startup it costs us $15 in advertising to get a
customer, and we can only make $7 from them then we have a problem. But if it
costs $15 to get them, and then once they are a customer, they make a bunch of
repeat purchases that yield $75 in profit, then we are happy.

Ultimately every venture of every kind has to have a Customer Acquisition Cost
(CAC) that is less than the Lifetime Value (LTV) of a customer. It’s a simple,
self-evident concept.

`“Yet It’s A Leading Cause Of Startup Death.”`

**A high percentage of startups die** because their cost of getting customers
turns out to be higher than they can make from them. Partly this is just
because we’re all optimists — we all think our startup is so awesome that
people will flock to become customers and they will remain customers forever.
But eventually, that **optimism fades** as we realize that marketing is
expensive and no customer stays forever. The immutable laws of economics set
in, and at some point, many startup founders find that their **LTV/CAC ratio
is slowly draining their bank account.**

> To paraphrase [Ernest Hemingway,](https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-
> hemingway-gradually-suddenly-zeitgeist/) Startups go broke two ways:  
> gradually, and then suddenly.

`Investors Tend To Obsess Over The LTV/CAC Ratio.`

**Investors care about your LTV/CAC ratio** because it’s the essence of a
successful business. But it’s also a proxy for the potential ROI of their
investment. If you have proof that you can spend $1 on customer acquisition
activities and get $5 in value back (an LTV/CAC ratio of 5.0), investors will
want to shovel as much money as possible into that engine.

Most of the VCs look for **‘just-add-money opportunities.’** Having a business
with an LTV/CAC ratio of over 5.0 looks like a “just-add-money opportunity” to
investors.

`But It’s A Blunt Tool That Is Better If Sharpened.`

Let’s say that during the quarter we spent $10,000 on sales and marketing and
got 1,000 new customers — a CAC of $10. But probably some of those customers
came through word-of-mouth, some came as referrals, some came from our PR
efforts, and some came from paid advertising. So we had a [blended
CAC](https://learningloop.io/glossary/customer-acquisition-cost-
cac#:~:text=Blended%20CAC%20is%20calculated%20by,heavily%20in%20customer%20retention%20efforts.)
of $10, but that doesn’t tell us anything about the relative effectiveness of
each of our different customer acquisition efforts. Which leads me to the next
point:

`Not All Customers Are Created Equal.`

If you look at some of the successful startups you will find that at some
point 80% of profits come from 20% of customers.

And the LTV (Lifetime Value) of our entire universe of customers, we’ll
probably see that 20% of them have a much higher individual LTV than the rest.
Wouldn’t we want to focus our CAC efforts on getting more of the high-LTV
customers? Yes, we would.

Therefore, [cohorts matter.](https://www.appcues.com/blog/cohort-analysis)

The two points above would indicate we **want to track the LTV/CAC ratio by
customer cohort**. For example, what’s the ratio of customers acquired through
Facebook advertising vs those acquired through Google advertising? Knowing
that would tell us a lot about how we should allocate advertising dollars.
What’s the LTV/CAC ratio for customers acquired through our referral program?
Knowing that would tell us how much we can afford to offer in a referral fee.
Knowing your **company’s blended LTV/CAC** tells you the health of the overall
engine, but it doesn’t tell you how to optimize the engine’s performance for
the next quarter. Tracking customer cohorts tells you that.

**Velocity also matters, and that's what makes a successful startup stand out
from the crowd.**

> `They don’t care about the LTV/CAC ratio, what they care about is the
> velocity with which invested CAC comes back in the form of LTV.`

They generally used CACD rather than CAC — the D is for “doubled”. CACD
answers the question, “If we spend $12 in customer acquisition activities, how
long does it take for us to get $24 back?” Even As an investor, they always
want to see a business with a CACD of less than eight months. This formula
gets to the heart of an inherent flaw in the LTV/CAC ratio: it doesn’t include
a time factor.

A business with an LTV/CAC ratio over 5.0 might seem good at first, but if you
have to service a customer for 10 years before you make back the money you
spent getting him, then it doesn’t seem so good, right?

_**Velocity matters.**_ So think about how you can measure CACD for your
business. Putting $12 somewhere where it returns with a high velocity will
accelerate your engine of growth.

That’s it! So, from now trackLTV/CACD than LTV/CAC.
