There’s a quick litmus-test conversation any early-stage VC will have with the
founder and it’s one that you should be as prepared for as your elevator
pitch. It goes something like this …

> VC: “How much money are you raising?”
>
> Founder: “$8–10 million”
>
> VC: “What’s your current burn rate?”
>
> Founder: “$250k / month.”
>
> VC: “So at a constant rate of burn rate you’d be raising enough for 2.5–3
> years. Why are you raising so much?”
>
> Founder: “Um. Let me check my plan.”

Usually, that’s the point in the meeting **where a VC realizes that this
meeting isn’t going to go very well.**

There are many things a VC is looking for in reviewing your business plan but
beyond things like the quality of revenue, margins, OPEX and CAPEX -

`there’s a simple rule investors generally consider “Cash In, Cash Out,
Milestones Achieved.”`

Simply put, a VC wants to evaluate how much cash you’re raising and whether
this amount is realistic. He or she wants to know how long the money you will
raise will last and **whether this is long enough to warrant taking a risk on
funding you.** Finally, the VC wants to know what your progress will look like
at the end of this period to know how easy it will be for you to raise your
next round.

If you don’t have a firm grasp of these concepts and how a VC thinks your
meeting is dead.

Cash in. It’s the amount of money you’re raising. A VC is looking for
reasonableness. Are you raising an appropriate amount of capital relative to
your progress, relative to your team size and relative to your needs?

Of course, the VC is looking to have specificity in how you plan to spend the
money you’re going to raise and plans that show a pie chart that says, “25% on
marketing, 30% on technology and R&D, 20% on infrastructure, 25% on G&A” **do
not get funded.**

VCs want you to raise the “appropriate” amount of capital, which would be
defined as “what is reasonable given your progress to date, your resources and
your needs for an 18–24 month period. VCs tend not to want to fund founders
who raise too much money in a given round also because they know that
sometimes having too many resources will lead to founders burning through cash
too quickly.

`Conversely, many VCs believe that constraining cash can often lead to
increases in creative solutions at a startup.`

One entrepreneur refrains Investors sometimes hearing “We want to raise some
extra money for M&A activities.” **This is a red flag for VCs.**

A VC wants to know that you have a solid plan to execute a stand-alone
business and if you require capital for an acquisition they’d rather evaluate
it at the time rather than over-fund you now. It’s true that some later-stage
private equity firms like to fund “roll-ups” (a company that acquires many
related companies in its sector), **but this is seldom the domain of VCs.**

Every VC knows that the amount you raise is often a proxy for your valuation.

VCs in early-stage rounds assume that you will likely take 20–25% dilution for
your funding round so if you’re raising $8–10 million they will assume your
expectation is $24 million pre at the low-end of the range ($8m x 4 = $32m
post money with $8m capital injected buying 25% of the company) and $40
million pre at the high end ($10m x 5= $50m post money with $10m capital
injected buying 20% or $40m pre).

So when you say $8–10m is your goal and you aren’t at all thinking about your
valuation know that a VC hears “$24–40 million pre-money valuation
expectations.” Of course, there are times when 15% dilution is more
appropriate and other times it can be 33% but in a first meeting investors
just trying to establish general ranges for reasonableness.

If you’ve only ever raised $500k, have limited revenue, have 7 people at your
company and aren’t a serial entrepreneur it’s a pretty tall order to imagine
going straight to $8–10 million unless your data is very compelling or you’ve
otherwise become “hot.” If you’ve raised $3 million previously, have $250k in
monthly recurring revenue and 23 staff an $8–10 million round might be more
down the fairway.

One big mistake many founders make is asking for an unrealistic amount of
money in the fundraiser. VCs will quickly qualify themselves out in what might
have otherwise been a chance for you to get them to engage in a process.

Founders should ask for slightly less than they need because if your ask is
reasonable and you get multiple firms interested then it’s easy to increase
round size and valuation later in the process. Every VC wants to fund a deal
that seems to have too much demand. Having too little demand leads to
bankruptcy.

A VC won’t necessarily tell you that they find your months of cash
unrealistic, your plans not well formed or your valuation out of range —
they’re more often likely to tell you, “It’s not a great fit for us at the
moment. We’d love to see you again when you have a little bit more traction.”
That’s what’s **called a “soft no.”**

Annoying, I know. But that’s the reality. So it’s incumbent on you to know
what a smart business plan and use of cash looks like.

Cash-out is when you’re out of money. In general, it is expected that you’ll
be raising 18–24 months of cash in a VC fundraising. If you have a shorter
runway than that the time you’ll have to make enough progress to raise more
capital is too short.

Assume that you’ll need to be raising for 3–6 months before closing your next
round so the last thing an experienced VC wants is you on the fund-raising
trail in 6–9 months. Having a minimum of 18 months runway means you have 12–15
months to make progress before the market will weigh in on your progress.

On the other side, VCs often don’t want to see a plan that funds longer than 2
years and seldom do they want to see 3 years.

Sometimes entrepreneurs make claims like, “I’m raising extra cash as a
cushion” but this usually falls on deaf ears with a VC. They don’t want you
experimenting for many years on their capital — they’d rather you come back to
market in 2 years and they can see what you’ve accomplished before deciding
whether to give you more money. You might not like this — but if you know it’s
how most VCs think it you will be better prepared for your conversations.

Above is a simple example graphic of a cash burn-down chart that any VC will
want to see in a spreadsheet or visual form and doing it on your own will help
you internally with scenario planning well before you’re even fundraising.

In the example, we assume that you are raising $5 million by month 4 of your
plan. In the normal case, you’d be running out of cash after 16 months or just
one year after you raise money. If you consider the “plan b,” which in this
case just holds the burn rate constant at $350k and has you out of cash in
month 19, it gives you more runway. In reality, this fund-raising plan should
take you to month 22, which would be 18 months since you’ve raised.

Assuming a VC has shown interest in your team, your plans, and your market and
they believe that you’re raising an appropriate amount of capital, sooner or
later they’ll begin thinking about the milestones you would have achieved by
the time you’re raising your next round of capital or by the time you’re out
of money.

Most VCs lead one round of financing in your company and are looking for other
VCs to lead subsequent rounds. Knowing that it’s more likely that an outsider
will fund your next round a VC will be thinking the following:

  * What will you have accomplished by the next time you go out to raise?

  * Will this be enough for another VC to show interest?

  * Will these milestones be enough for a VC would pay a higher price in the next round of financing?

  * If you’re not able to raise from outsiders and I need to lead this round, will you have made enough progress for me to face my partnership and tell them why we should fund an inside round? Will your burn rate be sufficiently low that I won’t worry about the amount of capital you’ll need in the next round of financing?

VCs want to fund innovations but they are also very cognizant of how much firm
risk they can take on given the size of their fund and the number of deals
they want to do per fund.

At an early stage, most founders make the mistake of going for all markets,
which leads to the failure of product adoption by customers. Why?[ Read more
