##### **START WITH**

AI will change the way we shop - from where we find products to how we
evaluate them, when we buy, and much more.

This raises a question: What types of purchases will be disrupted, and where
does opportunity exist in the age of AI?

a16z recently shared a [framework](https://a16z.com/ai-x-commerce/) from
[Justine Moore ](https://x.com/venturetwins/status/1955287508394127800)and
Alex Rampell that categorises consumer commerce into five categories based on
the level of consideration required for a purchase.

The takeaway: AI will disrupt these categories at different speeds, and the
biggest near-term opportunities sit in the middle.

Candy bars at checkout, funny shirts on TikTok, no research, no deliberation.
AI’s role is limited to hyper-targeted, personalised ads that appear at the
right moment.

Groceries, cleaning supplies, pet food. You know what you like, but AI can act
as an autopilot buyer, tracking prices, predicting when you’ll run out, and
ordering at the best deal.

Luxury skincare, a designer bag, home décor, researched, but not life-
changing. AI can serve as a personal shopper, finding, ranking, and explaining
the best picks based on your taste, past purchases, and style.

Laptops, sofas, bikes, high-cost, long-term items. AI’s role here is deep
research plus consultation: a back-and-forth “expert” conversation that
compares across brands and matches your exact needs.

Homes, cars, weddings, degrees, rare, high-stakes decisions. You won’t fully
outsource them, but AI coaches can guide research, flag risks, and even help
negotiate terms.

**The opportunity:**

The middle three, routine essentials, lifestyle purchases, and functional
purchases are where AI can create the biggest disruption fast. They’re big
markets with enough complexity for AI to add value, but not so high-stakes
that people resist automation.

PitchBook’s new
[analysis](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/a-sophisticated-vc-strategy-is-
not-worth-as-much-to-lps-as-youd-think) (2004–2024) challenges one of the
biggest assumptions in venture capital, that picking top-tier GPs
automatically delivers outsized returns.

  * LPs who were “highly skilled” at selecting top VCs added only ~61 basis points annually in return over 25 years — about 15% cumulatively. In buyouts, the advantage was nearly the same (~16% cumulative).

  * The data suggests that luck plays a bigger role in VC. PitchBook found that a top-fund portfolio outperformed a random one 98.1% of the time in VC versus 99.9% in buyouts.

  * The dispersion between the best and worst VC funds remains extreme (top quartile IRR: 10–30%, bottom quartile: -25%), but recent performance since the 2021 downturn has narrowed that gap.

  * Much of the alpha once credited to “manager skill” may instead stem from market timing and access — top funds like Sequoia or Founders Fund remain closed circles with data that often isn’t captured in public benchmarks.

  * As one investor put it, “While luck influences outcomes, you can’t build a repeatable strategy around it.”

LPs might not gain as much alpha from “picking winners” as they think — unless
they can access the truly elite funds where reputation, network, and timing
still compound advantage.

PitchBook’s new [Q4 2025 Allocator Solutions
](http://file:///Users/sahilramteke/Downloads/Q4_2025_Allocator_Solutions_How_Much_Alpha_Is_There_in_Private_Markets_20288.pdf)report
analyses two decades (2004–2024) of performance to quantify how much manager
selection skill really adds for LPs in venture capital and other private
markets.

Key insights for VCs and LPs:

  * Manager selection skill matters—but less than assumed. Even a “high-skill” LP only adds 0.61% annualised alpha in VC portfolios over 25 years, compared to random selection.

  * Luck plays a major role. A VC portfolio with skilled selection outperformed a random one 98.1% of the time—lower than 99.9% in buyouts, highlighting venture’s volatility and timing risk.

  * Dispersion is wide but less predictive. Despite top VC quartile IRRs (10–30%) and bottom quartile (-25%), timing and access matter more than skill.

  * Buyouts still yield steadier alpha. Across simulations, buyout funds produced slightly higher average alpha and more consistent “win rates.”

  * LP takeaway: Access to elite VC funds—those with proven networks and allocation barriers—still matters more than incremental selection skill.

The idea that LPs can “out-pick” the market in venture is overstated. The data
suggests venture returns depend more on access, timing, and luck than pure
skill.

##### **SOMETHING MORE**

Arvid Kahl — bootstrapped founder of Podscan — shared a great
[breakdown](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/handling-multiple-icps-as-a-
solo-founder/) of one of the hardest problems solo founders face: juggling
multiple Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs) without losing focus or burning out.

Here’s what he’s learned building a profitable SaaS that serves marketers, PR
agencies, founders, newsrooms, and even SEO professionals — all at once.

**1\. Don’t serve everyone at the same time**

Your product might technically help multiple audiences, but trying to target
them all simultaneously just spreads your effort too thin.

**→ Arvid’s approach:** Time-box your focus. Spend a few weeks improving
features or messaging for one ICP at a time, measure results, then switch.
This makes learnings clearer and reduces context-switch chaos.

**2\. Use demos as discovery tools**

Offering a demo isn’t just sales — it’s classification. Arvid found that demo
calls revealed which bucket customers belonged to (founders, PR teams,
analysts, etc.), what “job” they were trying to get done, and what language
resonated with them.

**Pro tip:** Ask precise questions during demos: “What problem are you trying
to solve today?” “What other tools are you using?” “What would make this 10x
better?”

**3\. Create landing pages for each ICP**

Different people care about different outcomes.

  * News agencies: highlight real-time trend tracking.

  * PR agencies: focus on reputation monitoring and alerting.

  * Founders: emphasize automation, API access, and integration.  
Each ICP gets its own landing page and messaging tailored to their goals — not
generic “features.”

**4\. Automate onboarding classification**

Podscan uses lightweight onboarding questions and email domain analysis (even
an AI-assisted background lookup) to auto-classify new signups.

This allows Arvid to customise the first-use experience — showing each user
what matters most to their role.

**5\. Adapt your marketing tone per audience**

Each ICP speaks a different language:

  * Founders: casual, meme-friendly, community-driven.

  * PR agencies: formal, outcome-focused, polished.

  * Analysts: quiet and private — they won’t share your tool publicly because it’s their competitive edge.  
Tailor tone, channel, and outreach accordingly. Cold emails might work for one
group but not another.

**6\. Leverage word-of-mouth where it works**

Founders and API users spread products through peer networks. Marketers and
analysts usually don’t. Arvid amplifies every mention on social media to
reinforce that organic growth loop.

**7\. Focus on sequencing, not splitting**

Trying to serve multiple ICPs is fine — if you do it intentionally. Focus on
one group’s success, then move to the next. Each vertical teaches you
something that strengthens the product for everyone else.

“The key is not trying to be everything to everyone at once, but being very
intentional about when and how you serve each group.”

Handle each ICP like a time-boxed experiment. Speak their language. And don’t
fear complexity — embrace it strategically.

When DeepSeek’s AI model “launched,” it looked like China’s answer to OpenAI —
surging to the top of app charts, trending across X, and even rattling US
markets. But new [disinformation
analysis](https://www.evai.ai/en/post/disinformation-the-deepseek-hype-was-
all-made-up-how-fake-accounts-managed-a-market-frenzy) shows the frenzy wasn’t
organic at all.

It was manufactured.

**What really happened**

Researchers analysed 41,864 profiles discussing DeepSeek.

They found 3,388 fake accounts, responsible for 15% of all engagement on X
(double the usual bot baseline).

Those accounts posted 2,158 times in a single day, flooding hashtags,
commenting on each other’s posts, and inserting themselves into authentic
conversations to look credible. Almost half were created in 2024 — right
before DeepSeek’s rollout.

This wasn’t amateur hype. It was a coordinated disinformation playbook.

**How fake networks created “AI buzz”**

  * Mutual amplification: bots liked and replied to each other to simulate popularity.

  * Piggybacking on virality: they hijacked large creator posts to spread DeepSeek mentions.

  * Integration: bots engaged with real users to pass as genuine fans.

  * Synchronisation: identical praise posts dropped in bursts to the game platform's visibility.

The result: a global perception of momentum that didn’t actually exist.

**Why this matters for tech & investors**

Fake AI hype isn’t just annoying — it’s market-moving.

  * DeepSeek’s “buzz” briefly wiped billions in US market value as investors reacted.

  * It distorted narratives about China’s progress in AI.

  * It showed that disinformation tactics once used in politics are now shaping tech adoption and investment sentiment.

**The new risk for companies**

Leaders can’t tell where genuine traction ends and synthetic hype begins. If
boardrooms, PR teams, or investors base decisions on distorted signals,
strategy becomes reactionary to fiction.

**What to do about it**

Organizations now need **AI-driven disinformation detection** the same way
they once needed threat intelligence.

  * 0–30 days: Monitor social and media spikes in real time.

  * 31–60 days: Run “bot hype” simulations to test response readiness.

  * 61–90 days: Build playbooks for investor comms, reputation defense, and rapid debunking.

Building these systems internally is nearly impossible — it requires cross-
platform data pipelines, model training, and 24/7 monitoring. Buying
specialized detection tools offers faster coverage and early warning.

DeepSeek’s fake virality is the first major proof that AI hype can be
weaponized — not just to sell software, but to manipulate perception,
valuations, and national narratives.

And in an AI era where hype _is_ currency, knowing what’s real might soon
become every company’s most valuable competitive edge.

Most founders assume they know who their competitors are. They pick names from
memory, or from who they see on X. But the truth is, your actual competitors —
the ones stealing traffic, attention, and customer mindshare — often aren’t
even on your radar.

That’s where ChatGPT comes in.

The team behind WTF is SEO? shared a brilliant
[workflow](https://www.seoforjournalism.com/p/chatgpt-for-competitive-
analysis) showing how editors use ChatGPT to run competitive analysis fast,
and it works just as well for founders and operators.

**1\. Identify who your real competitors are**

Most companies define competitors based on intuition (“we compete with X
because we’re in the same space”). But ChatGPT can reveal how Google and
readers see your rivals.

Try prompts like:

  * “Who are the biggest competitors for [your brand]?”

  * “Which sites rank for the same [topic/keyword] as [your brand]?”

  * “What are the strengths and weaknesses of [competitor] compared to [my company]?”

  * “Give me three reasons why [my company] can’t keep up with [competitor]. Return as a table.”

These prompts generate search-driven competitor maps, not just your internal
mental model.

**2\. Run top-level SEO and content gap audits**

Once ChatGPT surfaces key competitors, go deeper:

  * “Provide a keyword overlap audit between [your brand] and [competitor] for [5 priority topics].”

  * “Which ‘how’, ‘where’, or ‘when’ queries does [competitor] dominate?”

  * “Summarize the topic authority of [competitor] in 200 words.”

**3\. Use ChatGPT to wrangle raw data**

ChatGPT can help clean, sort, and summarise large sets of URLs or headlines
for quick insights.  
For example:

  * Export all homepage URLs using the SEO Pro Chrome extension.

  * Upload the list and ask: “Categorize these URLs by type (news, evergreen, affiliate, live blog) and identify trends.”

It’s an instant snapshot of how your competitors use homepage real estate —
and what topics dominate their link architecture.

**4\. Analyze headline patterns**

Good headlines drive both SEO and clicks. ChatGPT can help you benchmark
headline style, tone, and framing:

  * Upload headline samples from two sites.

  * Ask: “Compare tone, structure, and common framing patterns. Which ones are most engaging and why?”

You’ll get comparative tables showing tone, word choice, structure, and
engagement cues — a starting point for editorial best practices.

**5\. Turn insights into experiments**

Use ChatGPT’s summaries as hypotheses, not final answers. Validate everything
with analytics or search data, but the AI gives you the first 80% of structure
fast — freeing you to spend time on deeper validation and creative
positioning.

This same workflow applies outside journalism:

  * SaaS founders can benchmark landing page messaging across competitors.

  * E-commerce teams can analyse product naming or ad copy tone.

  * Newsletter creators can compare headline and CTA performance by niche.

Figma just [crossed](https://www.saastr.com/5-interesting-learnings-from-
figma-at-1-billion-in-arr/) $1 billion in ARR, growing 41% year-over-year,
with over $100M in net income and 24% free cash flow margins.

While most SaaS companies are slowing down, Figma is compounding like it’s
still early. Here are 5 takeaways founders should actually learn from this
moment:

**1\. Enterprise expansion becomes your engine at scale**

Figma now has 1,119 customers paying $100K+, up 16% QoQ. That small cohort
likely drives 40–60% of total revenue.

Enterprise expansion is the new growth motion once you pass $50M ARR. Track
your $100K+ customers as a separate cohort early — they’ll define your long-
term growth curve.

**2\. Retention defines greatness — not just acquisition**

Figma’s 129% net dollar retention has stayed steady for six straight quarters.  
That means existing customers are growing 29% annually without new logos.

Hitting 120%+ NDR after $100M ARR puts you in elite company. Optimise for
expansion before chasing new leads.

**3\. 40%+ growth at $1B ARR is** _**rare**_

At this scale, most SaaS giants slow to 25–30% growth. Figma’s still
compounding at 41%, joining a small club with Snowflake and MongoDB.

Growth this durable usually signals _efficiency_ , not burn. It means they’ve
nailed distribution, pricing, and product velocity simultaneously.

**4\. Mid-market is the next enterprise**

Figma’s mid-tier ($10K–$100K ARR) has nearly 11K customers — the “pre-
enterprise” layer.

Don’t underestimate mid-market. It’s where long-term expansion hides. Moving
20% of those accounts upmarket can add hundreds of millions in ARR.

**5\. Profitability while investing = mastery**

Figma is still spending heavily on AI and product R&D, yet maintaining 24%
free cash flow margins and a Rule of 40 score of 46.

The real game isn’t just hitting profitability — it’s balancing reinvestment
and cash efficiency without losing speed.

Figma didn’t scale by chasing hype — it scaled by compounding quality,
expansion, and retention.  
In 2025, when many SaaS companies are struggling to grow _and_ stay efficient,
Figma is proving the best products can still do both.

If you’re building in SaaS:

  * Start tracking enterprise cohorts early.

  * Build for expansion, not replacement.

  * And keep your growth efficient enough to outlast hype cycles.
