I stumbled upon a fascinating very old article by one of the late venture
capitalists and it really caught my attention. It delves into a hidden trap of
convertible note and liquidation preference multiple that most of the founders
are unaware of. It blows my mind after reading this, many of you are aware
about the **[convertible
note](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/understand-convertible-note-
investment)** is a really useful financial instrument if you are raising the
pre-seed, seed or bridge round. This helps you to maintain your startup
valuation but there is one hidden trap that most of the founders are not aware
about.

The article I stumbled upon was merely a conceptual story. However, I couldn't
resist sharing this valuable insight with all of you by providing a simple
mathematical example. Let's cut to the chase and explore the essential
paragraph that every entrepreneur should be aware of regarding this trap.

Consider a scenario where a founder discovers that their Series A investors
are entitled to a 1X Liquidation Preference, while the Convertible Note (CN)
investors have a significantly higher 4X Liquidation Preference.

One can only imagine the challenging situation the founder must be facing with
certain investors having a 4X Liquidation Preference.

Let’s start with a simple example - consider a founder raising a seed round
such that

Now the same founder is raising the Series A round with -

**Series A Round Dynamics:**

**Convertible Note Conversion Dynamics after Series A:**

  * Share Price (Valuation Cap option)= $4*($2.5m/ $10m)= $1

  * Share Price (Discount option)= $4*(1-20%)= $3.2

  * Convertible Note Investor will choose the Valuation Cap Option

  * Number of Shares with Convertible Note Investors= $605k/ $1= 605,000

  * Current Share Price= $4

  * Convertible Note Investors Investment Value= 605,000*$4= $2.42m

  * Convertible Note Investors Initial investment= $500k

  * Convertible Note Investors Investment Value after Series A= $2.42m

  * They are getting $2.42m/ $500k= 4.84X return whereas the Series A investors are getting only 1X Liquidation Preference.

  * This is excellent for the Convertible Note Investors but not good for the Founders

**And that’s why a Founder should always keep the liquidation preference
multiples in check.**  

Here is how.

  1. I Was going through an article written by Mark Suster where he offered a suggestion for the Founders which they should include in the agreement.

It goes like this:  
“If this note converts at a price higher than the cap…your stock [will] be
converted such that you will receive no more than a 1x non-participating
liquidation preference plus any agreed interest.”  

  2. Issue sub-series of preferred stock.  
Founders have an alternative approach to safeguard themselves from the impact
of multiple liquidation preferences.

They can incorporate a provision in the convertible note that outlines the
creation of a distinct sub-series of preferred stock exclusively for the seed-
round noteholders upon conversion.  

This unique sub-series is specifically designed to counteract artificially-
inflated liquidation preferences and provide added protection to the founders.  

Instead of granting 605,000 shares of Series A to the Seed-round convertible
noteholders, allocate them 605,000 shares of a new stock series called Series
A-2.  

Series A-2 would possess identical characteristics to the original Series A,
except for the liquidation preference.  

While Series A holds a per-share liquidation preference of $4.00, Series A-2
would have a reduced liquidation preference of $1.00 per share. This
resolution effectively resolves the issue at hand.  

That’s it for today.

I hope this gives the idea about the trap that most founders are unaware of
and the ways to tackle it.

Every early founders always wonder how to acquire the first 1000 customers and
this is really hard. You have to try out multiple channels and decide which
