Some companies don’t just beat expectations — they shatter them. [a16z calls
](https://a16zgrowth.substack.com/p/why-winners-win)these companies
**modelbusters** : breakout businesses that grow faster, compound longer, and
expand further than any model could predict.

There are two main forms:

**Bigger-than-expected TAM**

  * Roblox looked like a kids’ game, but Dave Baszucki built a cloud-native developer platform with its own economy. That unlocked older cohorts, leading to 61M+ daily actives and a fast-growing over-13 audience.

**New products that unlock adjacencies**

  * CrowdStrike started as a cloud-native AV replacement but built 29 modules on the same architecture. 48% of customers now run 6+ modules, driving $500M+ of net-new ARR annually.

  * Anduril flipped the defence model: building first, then selling to the DoD. Its cloud-native Lattice OS lets them cross-sell across artillery, ISR, and more — tapping into a $3T budget.

How to know if you’re building a modelbuster:

  * Focus on **“what” products** , not just “how” products. Reimagine categories, don’t just change distribution.

  * Look for **pull, not push** — is the market demanding more of your product?

  * Build or harness **network effects**. If not, aim for strong brand + GTM leadership.

  * Prioritise **compounded growth**. Every point of growth is worth ~2x a point of margin in the long run.

AI is setting the stage for the next wave of modelbusters. Just like the
iPhone or Roblox in their eras, companies that ride this platform shift with
new products, new business models, and true pull from users will massively
outpace the models. - [Read the full report

On Tuesday, OpenAI [announced](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/openai-
investment-strategy-july-2024/) it will acquire product development platform
Statsig for $1.1B in stock. Statsig’s CEO Vijaye Raji will become OpenAI’s CTO
of Applications, reporting to former Instacart CEO Fidji Simo.

This caps a two-year streak of acquisitions that show where OpenAI is
building:

  * **Statsig (Sep 2025)** — product experimentation ($1.1B)

  * **Crossing Minds (Jun 2025)** — AI recommendations (acqui-hire)

  * **io (May 2025)** — AI devices ($6.5B)

  * **Context.ai (Apr 2025)** — AI evaluation (acqui-hire)

  * **Multi (Jun 2024)** — remote collaboration (acqui-hire)

  * **Rockset (Jun 2024)** — data retrieval

  * **Global Illumination (Aug 2023)** — AI design studio

The pattern is clear: OpenAI isn’t just focused on models—it’s buying
capabilities across applications, retrieval, experimentation, and evaluation.
That combination signals a push to own not just the foundation models but the
end-to-end ecosystem for consumer and enterprise AI products. - [Read the full
report here](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/openai-investment-strategy-
july-2024/).

Despite $30–40B invested, 95% of enterprise AI projects deliver zero ROI. The
problem isn’t model quality or regulation; it’s a divide between adaptive
systems that learn and static tools that don’t.

Here’s what the [MIT
report](https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf)
shows:

  1. **The learning gap**

     1. ChatGPT is loved for ad-hoc tasks, but abandoned for real work because it forgets context and repeats mistakes.

     2. Employees want tools that remember, adapt to workflows, and improve from feedback.

  2. **Why most enterprise AI stalls**

     1. 90% of employees use shadow AI tools, while only 5% of enterprise AI systems make it into production.

     2. Companies overengineer rigid systems, chase flashy demos, and concentrate budgets on front-office use cases.

  3. **Where the real ROI is**

     1. 50% of budgets flow to sales/marketing, but the biggest wins are in back-office automation.

     2. Companies crossing the divide report $2–10M annual savings by cutting BPO contracts, a 30% reduction in agency fees, and $1M+ saved on outsourced processes.

  4. **What winning orgs do differently**

     1. Buy adaptive systems instead of building static internal tools.

     2. Empower frontline managers, not just central IT labs.

     3. Treat AI vendors like partners, not software providers.

     4. Measure business outcomes (savings, efficiency), not benchmarks.

  5. **The urgency**

     1. Vendor relationships are being locked in now, with compounding switching costs.

     2. The next 18 months will determine who builds a durable advantage.

##### **SOMETHING MORE**

[Nathan Barry (ConvertKit founder) ](https://x.com/nathanbarry)shared 10
practical ways to strengthen culture on a distributed team. ConvertKit have
built an 85-person remote team that’s driving $42+ million in annual revenue.

These go far beyond perks and focus on trust, connection, and shared meaning.

  1. **Create a private team stories podcast.**

Everyone has the same get to know you conversations starting from zero.
Instead, interview them about their life story for a private internal podcast.

The whole team can listen and get a head start on building relationships.

  2. **Build a culture of written, asynchronous communication** : This will save so many meetings, avoid people feeling left out if they weren't in the meeting, and protect focused work. Your team will also be forced to clearly articulate and refine their ideas.

  3. **Shared “no meeting” days** : Everyone has the same day for focused work each week. Team members can have days that they don’t need to get camera-ready (e.g. hair, make-up, etc) if they don’t want to.

  4. **Ask What did you get into this weekend?** Every Monday morning, we have a bot that posts to Slack asking people to share a photo (or a few) from the weekend. It's a great way to get to know co-workers on a personal level and see their families, interests, and lives.

  5. **Create an automated email sequence for new team members.** Explain how you work, where to find important things (like the joke Slack channels), fun facts about team members, explain inside jokes, & more. 

  6. **Host unsolicited feedback sessions:** This is where a small team (usually 4-8 people) gathers to talk about someone in the hot seat as if they aren't there for 10 min. When it's your turn all you can do is sit & take notes, then you get 5 min to respond. Here are the prompts:

     1. What does this person do that you find remarkable? What do you brag about them to other people?

     2. If they were up for the promotion of their career in 6 months, what would you tell them now to give them the best chance of getting it?

     3. Assume you're working with this person for the next 10 years. What behaviour isn't a big deal now but will get really annoying or frustrating over time?

This results in the best compliments, the most constructive feedback, and a
culture of direct, candid conversations.

  7. **Mandatory fun days** : With teams feeling burnt out, they force everyone to take the same day off. That means you don't have to come back to a mountain of Slack messages and emails. Come back & share a photo.

  8. **Host retreats 2x a year** : Regularly gathering your team in person is one of the most important things you can do. 2x a year ended up being the perfect cadence for us. We split our time: 1/3 work & strategy, 1/3 personal connection, and 1/3 downtime & fun.

  9. **Donate money together** : At a team retreat, we divided our team into groups of 4 with one goal: give away $10,000 in $100 at a time. With 50 people on the team, that meant each group had to find about 12 charities to support. Then we regrouped to share who we donated to & why.

What followed were the best stories that made for connection points: Someone
donated to education grants because they were the first in their family to go
to college. Cancer research because they'd lost a loved one. Pet rescue
because that's where they'd found a best friend....and so many more.

$100 isn't that much, so it would be fair to argue that the money would be
better donated to a single charity, but our main goal was life stories and
points of connection. Give it a try with your team. You'll all get a peek into
what your coworkers value & why.

> Don't let anyone tell you company culture is defined by free lunches and
> ping pong tables. It's a culture of trust, clear feedback, focused work,
> meaningful connection, and a shared mission.

Founders often ask: how much should I raise, what do I need to prove, and how
do I actually close a great seed round? Here’s a practical playbook you can
use:

  1. **Figure out how much to raise**

     1. Model for a 24–36 month runway. Median time from seed to Series A is ~23 months (Carta data).

     2. Add a 25% buffer. Unexpected things always happen.

     3. Example: If your burn is $60k/month → $1.8M for 30 months → round up to ~$2.25M with buffer.

     4. [Simple spreadsheet ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LIU-gXocWcKD5pCNXzFhL5TmKkbt3eUsFD7nA21AIS4/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\- how does this model work out?

  2. **Prove the basics before you pitch**

     1. Proof of commitment: quit your job, show you’re all in.

     2. Proof of work: talk to 30+ SMB buyers or 100+ consumers. Listen for 40%+ saying “wow, when can I get this?”

     3. Proof of insight: either a working prototype with early users or a clear memo/deck that explains your unique thesis.

  3. **Run a compressed fundraising process**

     1. Block 2–3 weeks on your calendar. Speak to as many investors as possible in that window.

     1. The compression creates FOMO and scarcity, which pushes decisions.

  4. **Do your homework on investors**

     1. Build a target list with check size, sectors, whether they lead, and reputation with other founders.

     1. Use Crunchbase, LinkedIn, and backchannel references to prep. Or you can download the [investors’ contact database](https://theventurecrew.gumroad.com/) here. 

  5. **Polish your materials**

     1. Keep it minimal: a clear deck or memo, a budget, and a[ simple model](https://theventurecrew.gumroad.com/l/financialmodeltemplate).

     2. Make it visually sharp — good design = signal of quality.

     3. Recommended templates: [Sequoia](https://slideshare.net/slideshow/sequoia-capital-pitchdecktemplate/46231251?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [YC](https://ycombinator.com/library/2u-how-to-build-your-seed-round-pitch-deck?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [40 deck](https://theventurecrew.gumroad.com/l/startuppitchdecks?layout=profile)

  6. **Line up strong intros**

     1. Best: portfolio founders of the VC, respected operators, or other active investors.

     2. Avoid: intros from lawyers/service providers or investors not investing in your round.

     3. If you don’t have an intro, send a crisp cold email — low hit rate, but worth trying.

  7. **Practice your pitch**

     1. Write a memo, even if you don’t share it. It [sharpens your story.](https://theventurecrew.gumroad.com/l/pitchstorytellingtemplate?layout=profile)

     2. Rehearse with “B-list” investors first. Iterate before you hit your top targets.

     3. Expect investor questions to carry more weight than your slides. Prepare FAQs.

  8. **Use angels to build momentum**

     1. Open a [SAFE](https://theventurecrew.gumroad.com/l/startuplegaldocuments?layout=profile) and let smaller checks come in early.

     2. This creates social proof that makes bigger VCs move faster.

  9. **Manage the close carefully**

     1. Don’t reveal names of other investors — just describe in general terms.

     2. A round isn’t closed until funds are wired. Push for quick close dates.

     3. Treat verbal commitments as meaningless until you see a signed SAFE/term sheet.

If you take away one thing: seed rounds are less about a perfect business and
more about running a tight, well-planned process that creates momentum and
scarcity.

You’ve probably heard of North Star metrics.

It’s the single metric you orient your company around, above all else.

Having one promotes alignment, focus, and a shared goal across the company.

But it’s important to make sure your north star meets a few criteria:

  1. It isn’t more than one metric — you’d be surprised how often companies will say that different parts of their business have different north stars. This defeats the purpose.

  2. It’s not an OKR. A north star doesn’t have a “key result” attached to it.

  3. It’s directly related to customer adoption. The way you measure this can be based on attention, transactions, or productivity, but in all cases, the focus is on building your customers’ love for the product.

Here are some north stars and what a bad version would have been, instead:

Not all pivots are created equal. After working with dozens of early-stage
startups at SPEEDRUN, here are some of the most common bad pivots founders
make, [shared](https://x.com/andrewchen/status/1836130892575838674) by a16z
partner:

  1. **B2B → consumer**  
Teams with enterprise DNA often underestimate consumer distribution. The
reverse (consumer → B2B) tends to work better.

  2. **Adding social/notifications to fix retention**  
If your core experience leaks, layering features like chat or sharing won’t
save you. Low retention = no product love.

  3. **Chasing trendy tech (AI, web3, etc.)**  
Bolting on new tech doesn’t fix a weak core product. Users and investors can
tell when it’s native vs. gimmick.

  4. **Premature platforms**  
Failing with one niche? Zooming out to “serve everyone” rarely works. Broad
apps usually succeed by zooming _in_ , not out.

  5. **Paid → free**  
If users don’t care when it’s paid, they won’t care when it’s free.
Indifference kills, even at zero price.

So what does work?

  * Zooming in: double down on your most engaged users.

  * Pivoting into nearby categories that customers already understand.

  * Starting fresh based on the “secret” you’ve learned.

  * Fast-following a successful competitor but inverting one key feature.

Pivots aren’t a silver bullet, but if you’re going to make one, make sure it’s
grounded in real user insight, not desperation.

Most employees undervalue their ESOP because no one explains it well. Founders
often say things like “you’re getting x% of the company” or “this is worth
$40K”, but that sets false expectations and creates more confusion than
clarity.

Here’s how to fix it:

  * Start early: explain ESOP terms clearly during the offer and onboarding, exercise price, vesting schedule, and exit conditions

  * Don’t frame equity in dollar terms; instead, give a basic scenario model showing what outcomes might look like at different exit values

  * Run ESOP explainer sessions for the full team: what it is, why it exists, how it works

  * Use forecasting tools to show employees how equity compounds over time

  * Update regularly on valuation changes, exit planning, and how that affects the value of their shares

  * Share the actual plan rules, total shares, option pool size, cliff period, and what happens when they leave

The goal isn’t to hype up equity, it’s to make it understandable. When
employees get it, they start thinking like owners. ([Read full post
