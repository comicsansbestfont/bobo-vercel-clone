##### **TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

The Classical school of Economics chanted, "Supply, creates its demand!” Fast
forward to the modern era, the “supply first'' days are long gone. We live in
an age of abundance, and **new-age entrepreneurs must find the customer demand
before creating supply.** In modern entrepreneurship, this saying has
reversed: "Demand creates its supply."

**Where do you think demand originates from?**

The answer is simple: From a problem waiting to be solved!

If you closely look at any long-lasting business, you'll realise that its core
idea germinated from solving customers’ heartfelt problems. A significant and
market-relevant problem. No surprise that Uri Levine, the founder of Waze,
suggests, "_Fall in love with the problem, not the solution._ " In this
writeup we will dive into -

  * Great companies focus on solving heartfelt problems.

  * What defines a heart-felt problem?

  * The five characteristics of heartfelt problems

  * How do you identify if a heart-felt problem is worth solving?

A study conducted by the [Harvard Business
Review](https://hbr.org/2017/01/are-you-solving-the-right-problems) confirmed
that 85% of executives believe that their organisations diagnose problems
poorly. Most of them agree that this results in poor time and cost management
and lost opportunity costs.

Problem-solving involves finding innovative and creative solutions to address
societal, technological, or business-related problems.

Take, for example, WhatsApp's story. When its founders started the company,
their main focus was on solving heart-felt problems concerning the high cost
of international communication. This societal problem has existed for
centuries since [empires started to take over the
world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_communication).

WhatsApp wasn’t the only player in this space—Viber, Google Allo, Kik, Skype,
and even FB Messenger were competing in the market.

**The team at WhatsApp recognised that mobile carriers and other apps were
going against the customer problem.** Competitors like Viber and Skype limited
the experience by charging for international VOIP calls, and mobile carriers
were charging exorbitant prices for international SMS.

WhatsApp doubled down on the customer problem and created features like free
calls, free instant messaging, and only 99 cents for the app.

The bet paid off, and they grew by [100M users every
month.](https://backlinko.com/whatsapp-users) The exit? A whopping [$19
billion](https://www.bing.com/search?q=whatsapp+19+million&cvid=102a56012cb248c39e0e56456ee47ce1&aqs=edge..69i57j69i64.3856j0j1&pglt=43&FORM=ANNTA1&PC=HCTS)
from Meta with only a [team of 32
people](https://sequoiacapital.tumblr.com/post/77211282835/four-numbers-that-
explain-why-facebook-acquired).

**What does this tell us?**

Customer problems are the North Star for all great companies.

WhatsApp was able to focus relentlessly on the need for cheaper and faster
international communication. Every decision they made focused on making
communication more affordable and quicker for their users.

> Customer problems don’t change; it’s only technology and customer behaviour
> that does.

WhatsApp wasn’t the first app to democratise communication, and Amazon wasn’t
the first e-commerce company. If it’s a valuable problem, someone is already
solving it. So don’t jump into solutions too quickly for fear of losing market
share.

“Competing on a solution is a zero-sum game that eventually leads to a feature
war, then a price war and all value is eventually destroyed.

In the startup world, the onus lies on founders to fall in love with the
customer problem. When the customer problem is clear, founders can create
solutions from new customer behaviours and emerg

ing technology trends to create innovative businesses.

So how do you identify a heart-felt problem for your customers? Let’s take a
look.

Customer problems exist across multiple layers. There’s a surface layer where
they tell you a solution they have in mind—like I want to save money making
international calls. But at its core, all problems distil down to one or a few
of [these emotions:](https://www.hgi.org.uk/resources/delve-our-extensive-
library/resources-and-techniques/meeting-emotional-needs-while-socially-
isolated)

  * Security

  * Attention

  * Control

  * Meaning & purpose

  * Privacy

  * Community

  * Intimacy

  * Status

  * Achievement

**How many of these emotional problems do you think WhatsApp solves?**

Great entrepreneurs look beyond the customer-suggested problems. They ask “5
whys” until they get to the emotional reason that causes a customer to seek
out a product.

Take the case of Slack, a workplace communication tool that has revolutionised
how offices communicate.

Before Slack existed, office communication relied on email. The email was
designed to be formal and disposable. However, Slack channels allowed teams
with a shared interest to create more inclusive communication for everyone.

Suddenly, people working on the same project can create a project channel with
a **“searchable log of all communication and knowledge” ([which is what SLACK
stands for](https://www.businessinsider.com/where-did-slack-get-its-
name-2016-9#:~:text=In%20a%20Twitter%20thread%20from,of%20All%20Conversation%20and%20Knowledge.%22)).**
What used to be an email thread now has a permanent space to foster a
discussion around a common goal.

People can create project channels, shared interest channels, to company
announcements. Giving internal teams shared meaning and purpose for the
company they work in.

Companies are not buying Slack to replace emails but are buying Slack for the
sense of community, meaning and shared purpose.

Here are the five characteristics of heart-felt problems. The deeper the pain,
the more value you can get from your customers:

  1. **Emotional** — the problem must have an emotion attached to it

  2. **Functional** — the problem must fulfil the basic functional need of the problem

  3. **Frequent** — the problem must happen frequently enough for the user to justify the value

  4. **Urgent** — the problem must have an impending deadline

  5. **Unavoidable** — the problem must not have an easier way to get around the problem

It’s the entrepreneur's job to identify these five characteristics of a heart-
felt problem and provide a solution to solve it well.

> "In a great market—a market with lots of real potential customers, the
> market pulls product out of the startup. Conversely, in a terrible market,
> you can have the best product in the world, and it doesn’t matter—you’re
> going to fail."
>
> \- Marc Andreessen

You’ll need to generate product ideas from market research and then identify
customers' problems in that market to solve.

The first step is to research the market you want to be a part of. The
opportunity size is based on how much your customer is spending to solve the
problem right now. This information can come from industry research,
government websites, and annual reports of key competitors, or you may even
need to commission research if it’s too niche.

##### **QUICK DIVES**

You've just wrapped up your pitch. The screen goes dark after the Zoom call,
or you step out of the conference room, feeling confident. But what's going
through the investors' minds at that crucial moment?

**[NFX](https://www.nfx.com/)** has shared great insights and investors'
frameworks for how they evaluate founders. I'll share some key points and
notes for you to consider...

When the door closes, there's an almost electric moment as investors exchange
glances. It always goes one of two ways:

**Scenario A:** Pure electricity. The partners can barely contain their
excitement. They're ready to start due diligence immediately, eager to call
their colleagues about this amazing founder they just met.

**Scenario B:** Silence. Maybe a few shrugs. That ineffable feeling that this
just isn't the one.

Here's the hard truth: that initial gut reaction matters more than anyone in
venture capital likes to admit. If you land in Scenario B, climbing out of
that hole is incredibly difficult. Worse yet, most VCs won't give you the real
reason why. Some might even string you along while they wait to see if other
prominent firms bite.

What many founders don't realize is that even in deep tech and biotech, where
breakthrough IP and massive market potential are crucial, the decision often
comes down to the people. In software, where pivots are practically
guaranteed, this becomes even more critical.

When we invest at the seed stage, we're not just betting on your idea or
technology – we're betting on you. We need to believe you're the person who
can navigate the marathon from seed funding to a massive exit. This is
precisely why it's such difficult feedback to give: it feels deeply personal
and seemingly not actionable.

**When investors get truly excited about a founder, there's one word that
consistently comes up in partner meetings: "compelling."** It's frustratingly
vague, but it speaks to a fundamental truth in venture capital – that
ineffable quality that makes us think, "We have to invest in this person."

Think of it like scouting quarterbacks in football. Beyond the measurable
metrics – arm strength, accuracy, speed – there are those crucial
"intangibles" that separate the good from the great. It's that feeling you get
watching Tom Brady or Patrick Mahomes with two minutes left in the fourth
quarter. You just know they're going to find a way to win.

Starting a company isn't just challenging – it's an exercise in sustained
suffering. Your health will take a hit. Relationships will strain. You'll
battle constant FOMO and imposter syndrome, watching others seemingly race
ahead while you struggle. During my time as CEO, I called it the "clenching
feeling of death" in my gut.

Before you even think about pitching VCs, look yourself in the mirror and ask:
Do you truly want this life? Many first-time founders jump in without
understanding the real cost. Even Jensen Huang recently admitted he wouldn't
do it again. Your ability to convince investors you can endure this journey
starts with truly convincing yourself.

The best founders don't start companies because they want to – they do it
because they have to. It's not a choice; it's a compulsion. This manifests in
countless small ways: your browser history is filled with market research,
your friends are tired of hearing about your ideas, and your mind constantly
living in the future you're trying to build.

Beyond basic founder-market fit lies something deeper: genuine care for your
market and mission. You can't fake this long-term, and VCs can sense the
difference. If you truly care, you'll naturally do the extra things that put
you ahead of competitors. You'll instinctively know the difference between
meaningful innovation and incremental improvement.

As Naval Ravikant says, you escape competition through authenticity. This
isn't about faking it till you make it – it's about being genuinely obsessed
with your mission.

The most compelling founders demonstrate a rare form of multifaceted
competence. They excel at both the strategic view and the tactical details.
They can articulate the big vision while showing mastery of the small things –
like responding to emails promptly with the perfect balance of insight and
precision.

This is the quarterback quality: knowing exactly where the ball needs to go
and having the skills to get it there, even under pressure.

Here's what many founders miss: in that pitch room, you're selling yourself as
much as your company. If you're getting consistent "no's," it might not be
your idea or market – it could be how VCs perceive you as a leader.

This can be tough feedback to receive, which is why most VCs won't give it.
And remember: not every VC will see you the same way. You won't be for
everyone, and that's fine. What matters is finding the investors who recognize
your intangibles and believe in your ability to lead.

The key is understanding that your personal qualities – your grit, compulsion,
authentic passion, and leadership – are just as crucial as your deck, your
tech, or your market size. Master this hidden game, and you might find
fundraising becomes surprisingly straightforward.

After working with founders in the Consumer AI space -
[Olivia](https://x.com/omooretweets), a partner at a16z, noticed a clear
pattern that makes subscription businesses work. She shared -

Most successful companies nail at least two of these three metrics, but the
truly exceptional ones hit all three:

  1. High Conversion (4-5%+ from signup to paid)

  2. Strong Retention (40%+ of paying users still active after 12 months)

  3. Organic Acquisition (75%+ of users coming in for free)

Let's break down what happens when you have different combinations:

High Conversion + Strong Retention (but paid acquisition): You can make money
and potentially turn a profit, but everything hinges on managing your customer
acquisition costs (CAC). Your growth will be limited by how quickly you can
recoup your marketing spend.

High Conversion + Organic Acquisition (but poor retention): You'll build both
users and revenue, but low lifetime values are your Achilles' heel. There's
not much room for error since each customer isn't worth as much in the long
run.

Strong Retention + Organic Acquisition (but low conversion): You'll grow your
user base quickly, and people love your product. The challenge? Turning that
love into revenue. You've built a great product, but haven't quite cracked the
business model yet.

The Dream Scenario - All Three: This is what investors get excited about. You
have a business that fills itself with users, converts them efficiently, and
keeps them around. Even if these numbers dip as you scale beyond early
adopters, you have enough cushion to stay healthy.

Think of it like a bucket - you want it to fill itself (organic acquisition),
not leak much (retention) and contain something valuable (paying users). Hit
all three, and you've got something special.

Knowing when to quit and when to stick with it is a key skill for all startup
founders.

Even the best investors in the world aren’t right all the time. So most
investors apply a portfolio approach (Simple word — Broad Portfolio) to spread
their risk and increase the chances of backing a billion-dollar opportunity —
Power Law Guys….

In any investor’s portfolio, you have **three types of startups** : the dogs,
the stars, and the zombies.

**Dogs** run out of cash before finding a scalable business model. These
companies return nothing to the investors.

**Stars** are the home runs — the investments that generate 10x returns and
make up for all the dogs.

**Zombies** are companies that are neither dogs nor stars. They make revenue,
perhaps enough to break even, but not enough to generate a huge return for
investors. Their growth seems stagnant and they can’t consistently generate
more revenue than costs. They are constantly raising money, are focused more
on investors than on customers, and rarely have a unique value proposition
that generates exponentially more value for customers than existing solutions.

Investors see zombie startups as no longer attractive, and not worth a follow-
up investment — which can be the kiss of death for those companies.

**What Creates a Zombie**

If you have read a book by [Seth Godin](https://www.sethgodin.com/) titled The
Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick).

Godin’s main idea is that to be the best in the world, you must quit the wrong
stuff and stick with the right stuff. In the case of startups, it says that
after some initial traction, there comes a dip.

**From there, one of two things happens:**

The dip bounces back and starts to trend upward to scale, or the dip turns
into a cliff and never bounces back. Godin proposes that at the bottom of the
curve — in the dip — founders have to choose to double down or cut their
losses.

The ability to know when to hold them and when to fold them is the difference
between dogs and stars. Zombies happen because some founders get caught up in
the dip, and neither flame out nor take off to greatness.

**How to Tell If Your Startup Is Doomed**

Many signs can alert a founder (or investor) that a startup is stalling and
zombie-bound. But the following signals can show that you may be in a zombie
phase:

  * You don’t want to get out of bed in the morning.

  * You don’t want to go out in public for fear you’ll have to explain what you do.

  * You haven’t hit 10 per cent week-over-week growth on any meaningful metric (revenue, active users, etc).

  * You’ve been working on the same idea for more than a year and still haven’t launched.

  * You’ve launched a consumer service and have less than 2 per cent week-over-week growth in signups.

  * You’ve launched an enterprise service and have less than 2 per cent week-over-week growth in the revenue pipeline.

  * You are the CEO and hole yourself up in the offices so you don’t have to talk to employees and can read TechCrunch.

  * You’ve hired consultants to figure out revenue, culture, or product in a company of less than 10 people.

**What You Can Do About It**

  1. **Accept it.** Call it a day, or as some founders choose to, flame out big. Double down on your efforts and fail large instead of quietly fading away.

  2. **Pivot one of the parts of your business model.** To become a startup unicorn, you likely need an exponential advantage in one of these areas to shift from zombie to star (think: Netflix offers 10x the entertainment of a movie theatre for less than half the cost). There are lots of examples of how a pivot evolved from a zombie into a star: Yelp, YouTube, PayPal, Flickr, Groupon, and Shopify.

  3. **Organize an acquihire and make lemonade from your lemons.** Sometimes, others can leverage what you have built to drive growth in their business. This is often done through an acquihire (buying a company as a means of hiring that startup’s people). While this may not be an optimal outcome, it is often the best choice for zombies.

Unlike on the TV show _[The Walking
Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_\(TV_series\))_ , zombie
status isn’t forever. There are examples of startups pivoting and becoming
stars (and many more examples of startups pivoting and becoming dogs).

But what’s more important is that the decision you make is making a decision.
Do not delude yourself.
