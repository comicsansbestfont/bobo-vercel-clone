(Google Images)

Nowadays - It's pretty common for companies to claim they've nailed product-
market fit when, in reality, they're quite far from it. I'd argue this is a
major cause of downfall, especially for post-seed companies.

Many founders often **face a dilemma** where they believe that they have
achieved product-market fit based on some factor, but honestly, it’s just a
**"Fake Product-Market Fit."** What are those factors?

  1. Firstly, some founders believe they've hit the jackpot **when they secure funding from impressive individuals or renowned funds.** The thought is that if these influential people or funds chose their company, it must mean they have product-market fit. This belief is surprisingly widespread. 

  2. Secondly, there's a trend where **companies manage to raise substantial amounts** , even before having a product that people truly love. Interestingly, instead of focusing on users and improving the product, founders often shift their focus to building the company, which is usually not the best move. 

  3. Thirdly, there's this phenomenon we call "**magical thinking** ". It involves **ignoring obvious facts** or not bothering to measure crucial metrics that would reveal whether product-market fit exists. For instance, not understanding churn or the payback period after acquiring a customer. If you're not aware of these numbers, it's **easy to convince yourself that you've achieved product-market fit** **when you haven't.**

  4. Lastly, there's a tendency for people to delude themselves into thinking they've achieved product-market fit simply because **they don't want to face the idea that they might need better engineering or product improvement**. Admitting that improving the product is challenging, they find it easier to just believe their product is already good. 

Most of the founders fell into this **trap of ‘Fake Product Market Fit’**. Not
only this - One of the most common misconceptions is that

`“Product-Market Fit Means Only You've To Build A Product That Your Users
Want.`

`In reality - the product market fit is more about the numbers.”`

**What Does It Mean?**

Product-market fit typically feels like your product is gaining traction with
profitable usage.

**Here is the breakdown:**

> ”your product is attracting users, and word of mouth or advertising channels
> are working well. Users love your product, and they're sticking around.  
>  
> However, there's a catch.
>
> Parts of your product that you didn't build to scale are **starting to
> break**. It could be software components or operational aspects, but
> something is faltering because it wasn't designed for this level of
> success.”

**You might be thinking what’s this profitable usage about?**  
“It means these users are the ones you want, and economically, they make
sense. You're not spending a lot for a user who only brings in a fraction of
that cost. There's no crazy three-year payback period or anything like that.

`So, for genuine product-market fit, we need both these components:  
1. a product that's breaking in a good way due to increased usage   
2. users who align with the economics you desire.`

To achieve genuine product-market fit, founders need to determine if they have
a real connection between their product and the market, instead of a fake one.
Here are some signs that may indicate a fake product-market fit:

  1. **Rapid Hiring Spree:**

A common signal is a sudden surge in hiring. Founders often believe they've
achieved product-market fit, and the team expands rapidly from four to twelve
members in no time.

  2. **Business Over Engineering Focus:**

If you notice a shift towards hiring more business people than engineers,
especially with the rationale of scaling the sales team, it could be a red
flag that the numbers aren't moving as expected.

  3. **Absence of Metrics Dashboards:**

A clear indication is the absence of metrics dashboards. When no one's
actively looking at the numbers and decisions are made based on feelings and
guesses, it suggests a lack of concrete data.

  4. **Excessive Spending on Luxuries:**

While it might be harder during challenging times like COVID, overspending on
nice offices, trips, and dinners can be a warning sign that the focus has
shifted from product improvement to unnecessary luxuries.

  5. **Flatlining Graphs:**

If your performance graphs are consistently flat, it's a straightforward sign
that the expected growth or user engagement isn't happening as anticipated.

  6. **Missed Estimates with Excuses:**

Missing estimates and justifying them with reasons like "it's still okay" can
be a way of rationalizing the discrepancy between projections and reality.

  7. **Changing KPIs:**

A popular but concerning move is changing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
Shifting from one metric to another, especially when the original KPI is
flatlining, raises questions about the actual progress of the business.

**If you find yourself facing these signs,** it's essential to question what's
happening and whether the initial understanding of product-market fit was
accurate or if there are underlying issues in business progression.

Once you've identified the issue of fake product-market fit, here are things
that you can do to fix it and achieve product-market fit:

  1. **Choose an Honest KPI and Stick to It:**   
Selecting a truthful Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is crucial, especially
for Software as a Service (SaaS) businesses. Revenue is often the primary KPI,
comprising revenue from both new and retained users.

  2. **Carefully Monitor Retention:**   
Vigilantly tracking user retention is essential. If your product is genuinely
good, high user churn is unacceptable. Keeping a close eye on retention rates
helps ensure customer satisfaction.

  3. **Cap Your Burn:**   
Establish a monthly budget for expenditures (burn) and adhere to it,
particularly if you're pre-product market fit. Until product-market fit is
achieved, commit to not burning more than the predetermined amount each month.
This prevents falling into the trap of fake product-market fit or excessive
company spending.

  4. **Consider Raising Less Money in Seed Round:**   
Opting for a smaller amount in your seed round can be subtle but effective. It
reduces dilution and makes it harder to engage in magical thinking or
aggressive spending. A smaller budget forces a more careful focus on metrics
and numbers.

  5. **Start with Strong Technical Co-Founders:**   
Having robust technical co-founders at the outset minimizes the need to hire
numerous engineers later on. A strong technical foundation is instrumental in
preventing the fake product-market fit dilemma.

  6. **Implement a Three-Month Essential Rule for Hiring:**   
Enforce a rule that evaluates new hires three months after onboarding. If, at
that point, they aren't deemed essential—meaning you wouldn't want to work
without them—consider parting ways. Early employees should contribute
significantly to the team.

  7. **Make Revenue Generating Employees Self-Sustainable:**   
Early salespeople, for instance, should be self-sustainable. They should
generate enough revenue to cover their costs, ensuring that each revenue-
generating employee contributes positively to the bottom line.

  8. **Learn About Investors' Track Record:**   
Dispel the notion that impressive investors guarantee company success.
Investigate the less successful investments made by your investors.
Understanding their portfolio's ups and downs provides a more realistic
perspective on your own venture's potential challenges.

That’s It. So overall,

**Product market fit** is not just about building something that people want,
it’s more about the number game.

**For genuine product-market fit, you need two components:**

  1. a product that's breaking in a good way due to increased usage 

  2. users who align with the economics you desire.
