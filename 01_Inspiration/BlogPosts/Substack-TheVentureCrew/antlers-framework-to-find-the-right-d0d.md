##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

The Classical school of Economics chanted, "Supply creates its demand!” Fast
forward to the modern era, the “supply first'' days are long gone. We live in
an age of abundance, and **new-age entrepreneurs must find the customer demand
before creating supply.** In modern entrepreneurship, this saying has
reversed: "Demand creates its supply."

**Where do you think demand originates from?**

The answer is simple: From a problem waiting to be solved!

If you closely look at any long-lasting business, you'll realise that its core
idea germinated from solving customers’ heartfelt problems. A significant and
market-relevant problem. No surprise that Uri Levine, the founder of Waze,
suggests, "Fall in love with the problem, not the solution." In this writeup
we will dive into -

  * Great companies focus on solving heartfelt problems.

  * What defines a heart-felt problem?

  * The five characteristics of heartfelt problems

  * How do you identify if a heart-felt problem is worth solving?

A study conducted by the [Harvard Business
Review](https://hbr.org/2017/01/are-you-solving-the-right-problems) confirmed
that 85% of executives believe that their organisations diagnose problems
poorly. Most of them agree that this results in poor time and cost management
and lost opportunity costs.

Problem-solving involves finding innovative and creative solutions to address
societal, technological, or business-related problems.

Take, for example, WhatsApp's story. When its founders started the company,
their main focus was on solving heart-felt problems concerning the high cost
of international communication. This societal problem has existed for
centuries since [empires started to take over the
world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_communication).

WhatsApp wasn’t the only player in this space—Viber, Google Allo, Kik, Skype,
and even FB Messenger were competing in the market.

**The team at WhatsApp recognised that mobile carriers and other apps were
going against the customer problem.** Competitors like Viber and Skype limited
the experience by charging for international VOIP calls, and mobile carriers
were charging exorbitant prices for international SMS.

WhatsApp doubled down on the customer problem and created features like free
calls, free instant messaging, and only 99 cents for the app.

The bet paid off, and they grew by [100M users every
month.](https://backlinko.com/whatsapp-users) The exit? A whopping [$19
billion](https://www.bing.com/search?q=whatsapp+19+million&cvid=102a56012cb248c39e0e56456ee47ce1&aqs=edge..69i57j69i64.3856j0j1&pglt=43&FORM=ANNTA1&PC=HCTS)
from Meta with only a [team of 32
people](https://sequoiacapital.tumblr.com/post/77211282835/four-numbers-that-
explain-why-facebook-acquired).

**What does this tell us?**

Customer problems are the North Star for all great companies.

WhatsApp was able to focus relentlessly on the need for cheaper and faster
international communication. Every decision they made focused on making
communication more affordable and quicker for their users.

> Customer problems don’t change; it’s only technology and customer behaviour
> that does.

WhatsApp wasn’t the first app to democratise communication, and Amazon wasn’t
the first e-commerce company. If it’s a valuable problem, someone is already
solving it. So don’t jump into solutions too quickly for fear of losing market
share.

“Competing on a solution is a zero-sum game that eventually leads to a feature
war, then a price war and all value is eventually destroyed.

In the startup world, the onus lies on founders to fall in love with the
customer problem. When the customer problem is clear, founders can create
solutions from new customer behaviours and emerg ing technology trends to
create innovative businesses.

So how do you identify a heart-felt problem for your customers? Let’s take a
look.

Customer problems exist across multiple layers. There’s a surface layer where
they tell you a solution they have in mind—like I want to save money making
international calls. But at its core, all problems distil down to one or a few
of [these emotions:](https://www.hgi.org.uk/resources/delve-our-extensive-
library/resources-and-techniques/meeting-emotional-needs-while-socially-
isolated)

  * Security

  * Attention

  * Control

  * Meaning & purpose

  * Privacy

  * Community

  * Intimacy

  * Status

  * Achievement

**How many of these emotional problems do you think WhatsApp solves?**

Great entrepreneurs look beyond the customer-suggested problems. They ask “5
whys” until they get to the emotional reason that causes a customer to seek
out a product.

Take the case of Slack, a workplace communication tool that has revolutionised
how offices communicate.

Before Slack existed, office communication relied on email. The email was
designed to be formal and disposable. However, Slack channels allowed teams
with a shared interest to create more inclusive communication for everyone.

Suddenly, people working on the same project can create a project channel with
a **“searchable log of all communication and knowledge” ([which is what SLACK
stands for](https://www.businessinsider.com/where-did-slack-get-its-
name-2016-9#:~:text=In%20a%20Twitter%20thread%20from,of%20All%20Conversation%20and%20Knowledge.%22)).**
What used to be an email thread now has a permanent space to foster a
discussion around a common goal.

People can create project channels, shared interest channels, to company
announcements. Giving internal teams shared meaning and purpose for the
company they work in.

Companies are not buying Slack to replace emails but are buying Slack for the
sense of community, meaning and shared purpose.

Here are the five characteristics of heart-felt problems. The deeper the pain,
the more value you can get from your customers:

  1. **Emotional** — the problem must have an emotion attached to it

  2. **Functional** — the problem must fulfil the basic functional need of the problem

  3. **Frequent** — the problem must happen frequently enough for the user to justify the value

  4. **Urgent** — the problem must have an impending deadline

  5. **Unavoidable** — the problem must not have an easier way to get around the problem

It’s the entrepreneur's job to identify these five characteristics of a heart-
felt problem and provide a solution to solve it well.

>
> \- Marc Andreessen

You’ll need to generate product ideas from market research and then identify
customers' problems in that market to solve.

The first step is to research the market you want to be a part of. The
opportunity size is based on how much your customer is spending to solve the
problem right now. This information can come from industry research,
government websites, and annual reports of key competitors, or you may even
need to commission research if it’s too niche.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Recently, I came across [a
tweet](https://x.com/andrewchen/status/1884292311947051309) by Andrew Chen
where he discussed how founders often fall into the trap of chasing virality,
only to end up with a flood of low-quality users. It resonated with me, so I
thought to share my thoughts and a few key points on this.

Every founder dreams of their product going viral. A flood of new users,
signups spiking, your app trending on Reddit and X—it’s the fantasy, right?
But when it happens, reality hits differently.

It starts slow. A small group of loyal users finds your product. They give
feedback. You iterate. Feels good. Then, one day, a funny video about your app
blows up. A major influencer shares it. Signups skyrocket. Feels even better.
But then, the Looky-Loos arrive.

**The Looky-Loo Problem**

**LOOKY-LOO (noun):** A person who checks something out with no real intent to
use it seriously.

Going viral doesn’t just bring more users—it brings the _wrong_ users. These
aren’t your ideal customers; they’re tourists. They try the product, poke
around, maybe share a meme, and then vanish. Your DAUs spike, but retention
doesn’t. Your revenue doesn’t. Your support inbox? Flooded with nonsense.

Suddenly, you’re dealing with international users who don’t fit your market,
edge cases breaking the product and chaotic community interactions. If your
growth is built on Looky-Loos, it’s not real growth—it’s noise.

**Easy Come, Easy Go**

The growth that happens fast usually disappears just as fast. Here’s what
happens next:

  * The traffic spike dies down after a few days.

  * The new users don’t stick around.

  * Engagement drops. Conversion rates tank. Your metrics look worse than before.

  * You scramble to create another viral moment, only to realise you can’t manufacture lightning twice.

Traction isn’t just about more users. It’s about high-intent users—people who
genuinely want your product and will stick around long-term.

**What Works**

Instead of chasing virality, focus on growth that’s **durable, scalable, and
valuable** :

  * **Durable Growth:** Users who keep coming back. Look at D1/D7/D30 retention, not just DAUs.

  * **Scalable Growth:** Repeatable acquisition channels—referrals, SEO, paid marketing—not just one-time spikes.

  * **Valuable Users:** Not all users are equal. Focus on those who engage deeply, pay, and spread word-of-mouth.

**When Spikes Can Work**

Some situations where a viral moment _can_ be useful:

  * Waitlists: Filtering users before letting them in keeps quality high.

  * Raising VC Money: A spike in traction can help close funding but don’t build a business expecting virality.

  * Products Built for Churn**:** Some apps (e.g., AI photo generators) expect short-term use and monetise aggressively upfront.

  * Network Effects: If even 1% of a viral audience sticks, they can kickstart a community or marketplace.

**Focus on the Right Users**

Going viral might feel great, but it’s not a business strategy. Real traction
comes from gradual, consistent growth with users who care. Instead of chasing
DAU spikes, build something people love—because love, not virality, is what
makes a product last.

Also, if you really want to learn about building real virality products that
last long, I would highly suggest checking this podcast - [Nikita Bier’s
Playbook for winning at consumer
apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY).

Some of the most iconic marketplaces in the world didn’t grow by playing fair.
They grew by being scrappy, aggressive, and willing to operate in the grey.

Airbnb, Uber, Thumbtack, and even PayPal didn’t wait around for users to show
up, they took them from other platforms.

It’s called a vampire attack. And if you’re building a marketplace or trying
to overcome the chicken-and-egg problem, it might be one of the most valuable
frameworks you can study.

Colin Gardiner recently shared some of the [best insights
](https://www.gardinercolin.com/p/vampire-attacks-marketplaces)I’ve seen on
this strategy. He walked through how some of the biggest platforms in tech
history executed vampire attacks to bootstrap supply and demand, and what
founders can learn from them today.

Here’s a summary of the key ideas, case studies, and takeaways worth saving.

The vampire attack is a strategy where you deliberately siphon users’ supply,
demand, or both from an existing platform. You piggyback off the incumbent’s
hard-earned network, solve user pain with a better experience, and pull those
users into your own ecosystem.

It’s aggressive, often controversial, but extremely effective when done well.

Airbnb is one of the clearest examples. In its early days, the team noticed
people listing their rooms on Craigslist. So they built tools that let hosts
cross-post directly to Craigslist, and they emailed thousands of hosts telling
them to list on Airbnb too.

The result? Travellers saw Airbnb links on Craigslist. Hosts got better
exposure and a superior product. Both sides gradually migrated. That one hack
helped Airbnb break the cold-start trap.

Thumbtack did something similar. They built an easy listing tool for service
providers that also lets them repost to Craigslist with better formatting.
Providers loved it. Thumbtack grew. Craigslist unknowingly fueled it.

Uber poached drivers from Lyft in an even more aggressive way. They ordered
rides on Lyft, pitched drivers to switch mid-ride, and gave out bonuses.

Meanwhile, PayPal grew within eBay by simply offering the fastest, most
reliable payments until they became so embedded that eBay had no choice but to
acquire them.

Other examples include:

  * Outdoorsy piggybacking on Facebook Marketplace’s bulk listing tools before getting blocked

  * TikTok is buying billions in ads on YouTube and Instagram to steal users directly

  * Didi is beating Uber in China by subsidising rides and embedding itself inside WeChat and Alipay

  * SushiSwap is draining over $1B in liquidity from Uniswap using token rewards

  * Job marketplaces like Uber and Instacart are posting on Indeed to rapidly recruit drivers

The patterns repeat. First, find where users already exist. Second, build a
bridge to your product, whether that’s tools, integrations, scraping, or
incentives. Third, deliver a meaningfully better experience. That last part is
critical. Vampire attacks are a door opener. Retention depends on real product
value.

But this strategy also carries risks. If you’re too dependent on another
platform, whether it’s Craigslist, Google SEO, or Twitter APIs, you can get
cut off. Airbnb lost its Craigslist integration. Zynga stagnated after
Facebook throttled its virality. Meerkat collapsed when Twitter shut off
access.

So you use the vampire attack to gain momentum, but you don’t rely on it
forever. You need to build direct acquisition channels, own your user
relationships, and evolve the product into something people stay for, not just
click into.

There’s also an ethical tension here. Some tactics push boundaries. Some are
more cooperative. Some create value for both sides. It all depends on
execution.

The key is this: these attacks only work when the incumbent is vulnerable,
when they’ve stopped innovating, ignored user needs, or left a poor experience
unaddressed. And in a world where new platform shifts are emerging, especially
in AI, opportunities are wide open again.

Being early to the next platform unlocks is one of the strongest growth levers
you’ll ever find.
