##### **TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

Being first in the market is often seen as a competitive advantage, but how
real is this competitive advantage? For example, do you have to be first – new
product, new service, new market, etc?

Moving quickly and striving to establish your business as the ‘go-to’
product/solution in a new market (or niche) sounds like a competitive
advantage, but **the reality is often very different.**

If you study any new industry or market, you will find that most pioneers
didn’t build truly great products/services/companies, incumbents did!

**For Example**

Apple was relatively late to the smartphone market. Blackberry, Nokia, and
Windows had at least five years of a head start on the first iPhone – released
in 2007. Note: By 2009, the iPhone surpassed Blackberry sales.

White Castle had over a decade head start on most hamburger chains but failed
to capitalize on it – leaving Ray Kroc and McDonalds to revolutionize the
fast-food industry.

>  _Chrysler, Ford, GM, Honda, Nissan, and Toyota all released an electric car
> in the early 1990s. Tesla didn’t release its first car (Roadster) until
> 2005. A decade after traditional automakers already had their electric cars
> on the road._

Facebook was not the first social media site, Six Degrees was in 1997.
Facebook didn’t launch until 2004.

When Compaq released their “portable” PC (laptop), there were at least 15
other offerings at the time, but theirs was the first to run software built
for IBM.

We can list examples of companies failing to take advantage of being first in
the market. Some will argue that timing is the main reason why so many
pioneers failed to dominate the market.

`Timing Is Definitely An Important Factor, But It Is Not The Core Reason –
Execution Is. More specifically, excellent product/service execution and great
marketing execution`.

**Steve Jobs’s iPhone** , **for instance** , didn’t become a huge success
because it was the first smartphone, but because of excellent product
execution (an industry-first 3.5-inch touch-sensitive screen) and extensive
marketing to promote it.

On the marketing side, it started with a promise from Steve Jobs, “A device
that will deliver all the features of iPods as well as the smartphone.”
Creating a lot of excitement well before the first-generation iPhone was
revealed to the masses.

The next logical step for Apple was to reach out to influencers (e.g.,
reporters, reviewers, experts, etc.) to critique the new iPhone.
Unsurprisingly, most publications and reviews were favourable, describing the
first iPhone as a “breakthrough” device.

So it was all down to a great device? No.

While it had a great design, the iPhone had many adaptation challenges that
marketing had to overcome. For example, it had a substantial price tag of
$499-$599. At that time, higher than most of its competitors.

Second, customers had to sign up for a two-year contract with AT&T (using a
slower EDGE network and not 3G which was faster and available at the time).

While acknowledging these challenges, **Apple’s marketing team focused on its
unique selling proposition** – an industry-first 3.5-inch touch-sensitive
screen. As is the case with any significant product launch from Apple,
marketing had a healthy budget for television, print, and web ads.

Of course, your business doesn’t have Apple’s resources, but that’s not the
key takeaway.

> **The lesson to learn is that execution (product + marketing) is far more
> important than being the first to the market.**

In many ways, your organization is better off entering the market second,
third, or even fourth. Why? A road to new markets (innovative
products/services) is paved with mistakes and lessons learned. Expensive
lessons that your company can avoid if you pay attention.

**For example,** being first to the market means educating potential customers
on the new product/service – a very time-consuming and expensive marketing
exercise. Let the pioneers do that for you.

As we illustrated in our examples, being first is not always best.

Being a few years behind is often a better, more successful approach as long
as you nail your product/service and marketing execution.

Lastly, not being first will give you more time to build that great product
and secure the necessary marketing funds to support it.

##### **FEATURED TWEET**

In fundraising, the pitch deck plays a crucial role in securing meetings with
investors. Without a meeting, you have no chance of getting funded. Many
**founders create pitch decks with 20 or more slides, and this is where some
founders fail** to even receive a single call from investors.

We have shared a 10-slide format for the pitch deck that every founder should
follow….**[Read More
