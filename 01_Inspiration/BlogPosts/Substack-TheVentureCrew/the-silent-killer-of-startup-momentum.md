👋 Hey — it’s [Sahil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahilsr/), this time together
with [Delve](https://delve.co/book-

primary-aug13-25)!

Welcome back to Venture Curator, where we explore how top investors think, how
real founders build, and the strategies shaping tomorrow’s companies.
* * *

I’ve seen this happen too many times.

A startup raises a fresh round. Sales are heating up. Big logos are in the
pipeline. The energy is electric.

> Then out of nowhere, one question stops everything dead: "Are you SOC 2
> compliant?"

It sounds harmless, like a formality. But that single sentence has derailed
more momentum than any buggy feature, pricing objection, or product delay I’ve
ever seen.

What happens next is always the same. Your engineers stop building. Your ops
team starts digging through old systems. Your founder calendar fills with
audit calls.

Everyone’s in “find the screenshot” mode, hunting across five different tools.
Meanwhile, the client you were about to close? They quietly move on.

It’s a silent killer. You don’t see the damage right away, but the cost is
enormous - lost deals, slowed launches, and a team burning energy on busywork
instead of growth.

**Compliance: the quiet growth killer**

We obsess over product-market fit. We debate hiring plans. We read 10,000-word
threads on fundraising strategy.

However, we rarely discuss the operational drag that results from not being
prepared for enterprise buyers.

Enterprise customers expect compliance readiness from day one. SOC 2. ISO
27001. HIPAA. GDPR. You don’t just “get around to it later” without paying a
price.

I’ve seen what happens when teams ignore it:

  * Engineers burn entire sprints gathering logs and artifacts

  * Admins chase screenshots across Slack threads, email chains, and old drives

  * Founders watch weeks of pipeline stall because the audit takes months

It’s not just paperwork. It's an opportunity cost. And in a competitive
market, that’s lethal.

**What smarter teams are doing differently**

The best founders I know treat compliance like a product problem, something to
automate, streamline, and systematise early so it never becomes a bottleneck.

One tool I’ve consistently seen in those conversations:

Karun Kaushik and Selin didn’t **[set out to

a compliance platform. They were working in healthcare tech when HIPAA
compliance almost killed their momentum. Instead of grinding through it
manually, they pivoted to build the product they wished existed.

That was 2024. Today, the bet has paid off in a big way:

  * **Delve just raised a $32M Series A at a $300M valuation** , led by Insight Partners

  * They’re already profitable and doubled revenue last quarter

  * They’re trusted by **500+ of the fastest-growing companies** , including Lovable, Bland, and Wispr Flow

**How Delve works**

**[Delve](https://delve.co/book-
demo?utm_source=venturecrew&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=venturecrew-
primary-aug13-25)**[ ](https://delve.co/book-
demo?utm_source=venturecrew&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=venturecrew-
primary-aug13-25)is an AI-native compliance co-pilot. It’s built to feel like
a teammate, one that actually wants to do the boring parts.

Here’s what makes it different:

  * You can literally tell it what you need (“Pull all MFA screenshots for SOC 2”) and it fetches the evidence for you

  * It adapts to your tech stack, instead of forcing you into rigid templates

  * It flags compliance gaps in real time, so you fix them instantly instead of triggering last-minute fire drills

I’ve seen teams go from zero process to SOC 2 ready in a matter of days, not
months with [Delve](https://delve.co/book-
demo?utm_source=venturecrew&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=venturecrew-
primary-aug13-25).

**Why this matters now**

Nobody wakes up excited to talk about compliance. But if you want to win
enterprise deals, it’s not optional. And the earlier you address it, the less
growth you sacrifice later.

**Some of[Delve’s](https://delve.co/book-
demo?utm_source=venturecrew&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=venturecrew-
primary-aug13-25) customers are now closing 7- and 8-figure deals because they
passed security reviews instantly,** without big security teams or months of
prep. The AI agent did the heavy lifting.

That’s the real unlock: removing the drag. When compliance busywork
disappears, you get back the most valuable thing in a startup, speed.

In a market where the fastest company often wins, that edge can be the
difference between “we almost closed them” and “we just signed the deal.”

If you’re selling to enterprises and haven’t thought deeply about compliance,
you’re already behind. This isn’t about red tape, it’s about unblocking
growth.

[Delve](https://delve.co/book-
demo?utm_source=venturecrew&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=venturecrew-
primary-aug13-25) isn’t the only tool in this space. But it’s one of the rare
ones built by frustrated builders who lived the pain, not consultants selling
theory. It doesn’t just organise the chaos. It eliminates it.

The result? You and your team get to focus on what actually moves the needle:
building products, serving customers, and growing faster than your
competitors.
