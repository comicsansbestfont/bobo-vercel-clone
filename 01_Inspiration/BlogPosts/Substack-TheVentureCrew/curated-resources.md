When you’re building a startup, no one hands you the folder, one with all the
stuff you need.

  * Investor lists that work. 

  * Financial models that make sense.

  * Legal docs that don’t cost a fortune.

  * Templates that save hours.

So, we built it ourselves with input from founders who have bootstrapped and
those who have raised millions, as well as VCs who know what they’re looking
for.

Here’s everything we’ve created (and keep improving):

Note: For some databases, you can find both email and LinkedIn; for others,
you may find only an email or a LinkedIn link, as already mentioned in the
database.

You can explore them all here: [Venture Crew

Your support fuels the content we share through our newsletters and helps us
keep building for early-stage founders like you.

If there's a specific resource you're looking for, send us an
[email-](mailto:sahil.venturecrew@gmail.com) we might build it next.

With you,  
Sahil & The Venture Crew
