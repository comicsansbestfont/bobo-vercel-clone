##### **📜 DEEP DIVE**

This one’s a little different. Normally, we break down topics and share
insights, but today we’re giving you something bigger: **a massive database of
investors.**

Some of these lists we found online, others we painstakingly curated with the
Venture Curator team. We’ve double-checked everything to ensure accuracy, and
we hope it makes your fundraising journey easier.

Before diving in, feel free to check out our previous fundraising tips on the
[Archive Page](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/35-investor-databases-
for-easier?open=false#).

Here’s what’s inside each database:

##### **📄 QUICK WIN**

Most early-stage founders celebrate hitting product-market fit like it’s the
final boss.  
But here’s the brutal truth: You can hit product-market fit and still fail.

Brian Balfour (CEO of Reforge, ex-HubSpot) lays out a much more complete
model. He argues that real, repeatable growth happens only when four critical
“fits” align:

**The Four Fits and Why You Need All of Them -**

  1. **Market ⇌ Product Fit**

This is the classic PMF question: Did you build something people desperately
want, right now?

Most founders jump in here. But PMF doesn’t mean everyone loves the product;
it means a specific segment feels pain, finds relief, and keeps coming back.

Tactical check: If your retention is low, you're too early for PMF or in the
wrong market. Look for urgency, not just interest.

  2. **Product ⇌ Channel Fit**

Does your product work with your chosen acquisition channels or against them?

A self-serve SaaS can’t rely on enterprise sales. An outbound-heavy product
needs clarity and ROI. This is where many startups waste months trying to
force a channel mismatch.

Tactical check: Is your product naturally shareable (content, referrals,
integrations)? If not, don’t expect virality. Build for the channel, not just
hope for it.

  3. **Channel ⇌ Model Fit**

Are your acquisition costs sustainable at scale?

Many early wins are subsidised by founder hustle. But when you scale paid,
outbound, influencer, etc., your LTV must outpace CAC or you bleed cash.

Tactical check: Run a 6-month LTV: CAC ratio. Anything <2:1 = trouble. Paid
channel costs creeping up? Time to rethink pricing, upsells, or retention.

  4. **Model ⇌ Market Fit**

Can your business model unlock the size of your market?

You can build a solid $1M ARR tool… that can’t cross $5M.

Why? Because you priced it at $10/mo, and the TAM is tapped out. Your model
has capped your upside.

Tactical check: Can you expand revenue per user over time (land & expand)?
Does your market have enough urgency and budget to support a $100M+ business?

**Why this framework matters more than ever:** Most founders blame their
product when growth stalls. But the truth is, many of those stalls aren’t
product problems at all; they’re misalignment problems.

A good product launched into the wrong channel won’t grow. A working channel
paired with a weak pricing model will break. And a solid business model in a
market that’s too small? It hits a ceiling fast.

This is where Balfour’s framework becomes essential. And here’s the hard part:
most of these misalignments are invisible when you’re moving fast.

You might feel traction in one area and think you’re on the right track, while
something else quietly holds you back. That’s why founders who revisit these
four fits every few months tend to course-correct earlier and grow faster with
less wasted effort.

In short, product-market fit gets you started. But these four fit together to
determine how far you’ll go. You can watch this 17-minute video by Brian
Balfour on the[ same topic here](https://brianbalfour.com/four-fits-growth-
framework#:~:text=FOUR%20FITS%20FOR%20%24100M%2B%20GROWTH%20VIDEO).

If you’re a B2B SaaS founder and not leveraging Reddit, you’re leaving leads
on the table.

I recently came across the Reddit Marketing Guide by [Adam
Shaw](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-shaw-stl/), so I thought to share with
you some key points and my opinion with you. He shared - “Reddit is the #2
source of leads, right after LinkedIn. It’s where people are actively asking
for help and exploring new solutions—unlike LinkedIn, which is more about
storytelling and sharing success.

And here’s the kicker: 50% of my leads come from just answering questions on
Reddit for less than an hour a day.**”**

Here’s how you can do it

**Step 1: Turn Your Profile into a Landing Page**

Your Reddit profile is like a mini landing page. It’s the first place curious
users will go after reading your comments or posts. Make sure it’s optimized
to convert.

**How to set it up:**

  * Choose a username that’s tied to your brand or product.

  * Write an actionable profile name (e.g., “Helping SaaS Founders Scale”).

  * Add a CTA to your profile banner (e.g., “Download our Free SaaS Marketing Guide”).

  * Include your one-line product pitch and CTA in the bio (e.g., “We help SaaS founders grow faster. Subscribe to our newsletter below!”).

  * Add links to key resources like:

    * Lead magnets

    * Newsletter sign-ups

    * Product demo

**Step 2: Find Subreddits Where Your Audience Hangs Out**

Reddit is vast, but your audience is likely concentrated in a handful of niche
subreddits.

**How to find them:**

  1. Use Reddit’s search bar to look for your product keywords (e.g., “SaaS,” “startup growth,” etc.).

  2. Use Google to search for “your keywords + Reddit” (pro tip: Google is better at finding Reddit threads than Reddit itself).

  3. Pick subreddits with active, engaged members in your niche.

**Pro tip:** Use tools like [Gummy
Search](https://gummysearch.com/?via=fdaae0) to automate finding relevant
subreddits and posts.

**Step 3: Prepare a Lead Magnet**

Redditors hate being sold to. They love **value first** approaches.

That’s where a lead magnet comes in. It’s a way to engage your audience
without coming across as too salesy.'

**Examples of great lead magnets:**

  * In-depth guides tailored to specific problems.

  * Free trials of your product.

  * Newsletters with actionable advice (my favorite).

Make it easy for people to commit. For example, I use a newsletter landing
page to capture leads. By the time they get there, I’ve already built trust
through helpful comments.

**Step 4: Start by Commenting, Not Posting**

Engage first, post later.

**Why?** Comments are more personal and allow you to directly connect with
people asking for help. You’ll also learn what your audience really needs.

**How to comment like a pro:**

  * Answer recent posts (24-48 hours old) for better visibility.

  * Avoid crowded posts (0-10 comments is the sweet spot).

  * Add value. Most comments are generic—stand out by being actionable, specific, and helpful.

**Step 5: Be the Best Commenter**

The secret to success on Reddit? Write better comments than everyone else.

**Here’s how:**

  * Be highly relevant—answer only what’s asked.

  * Be specific—don’t just say “try this.” Explain _how_ to try it.

  * Go in-depth—assume the person has zero knowledge.

  * Stay friendly—ignore trolls.

**Make your comment stand out visually too:**

  * Use white space for readability.

  * Add bullet points to organize your thoughts.

  * Be longer than most comments (Reddit loves thoughtful responses).

**Step 6: Post to Curate Conversations**

Once you’ve spent a few weeks commenting, you’ll notice patterns in what your
audience talks about. That’s when you start posting.

But don’t make the mistake of being self-serving. Redditors can smell that a
mile away.

**Here’s what works:**

  * Don’t post a blog or self-promo content. Instead, ask questions that spark engagement.

  * Let the audience share their thoughts and experiences in the comments.

  * Use their responses to build conversations and authority naturally.

Reddit can be a goldmine for B2B SaaS founders if used the right way. Focus on
engagement first, provide value, and let the leads come to you.
