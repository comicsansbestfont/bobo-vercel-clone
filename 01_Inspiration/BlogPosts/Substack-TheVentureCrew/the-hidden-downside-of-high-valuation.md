##### **START WITH**

PitchBook’s latest
[analysis](https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q4-2025-pitchbook-analyst-note-
should-seed-investors-ride-the-high-and-pay-the-price) digs into a question
every early-stage investor is wrestling with:

Are these $30M–$40M seed valuations still worth it, or are we just paying for
hype?

Here’s what the data shows:

For years, “consensus deals”, the hottest seed rounds at the highest prices,
were worth the markup. They failed less, produced more 10x winners, and helped
concentrated portfolios catch the outliers.

  * **But rising valuations now come with shrinking upside:** Top-decile seed rounds are now priced around $40M pre-money, roughly 3× the market median, and the math is breaking:

    * Ownership shrinks with every follow-on round

    * Dilution compounds faster

    * Exit timelines have stretched to 11.5 years on median

    * Distributions are delayed, dragging down IRR

    * Only managers with deep reserves can protect their stake

  * **Return multiples are compressing hard**

For portfolios concentrated in these premium-priced seeds, the shift is
dramatic:  
Simulated results show the 75th percentile return multiple dropping from 7.7x
to 3.8x for recent cohorts.

Same “quality,” half the payoff.

Early traction no longer signals long-term quality; it simply attracts more
investors, creating bidding wars.

AI has intensified this. A handful of startups get swarmed by funds chasing
allocation, pushing valuations higher without materially changing
fundamentals.

When valuations drift too far above intrinsic progress, the hurdle rate
becomes unrealistic. Investors aren’t just buying access; they’re buying a
longer, thinner, slower path to liquidity.

High-valuation seed rounds used to be the smart bet for catching power-law
outcomes. In today’s market, they look more like a trade-off:

Less ownership, slower exits, lower multiples and no guarantee the premium
reflects true quality.

[Vy Capital ](https://www.vycapital.com/)might be the most unconventional and
effective investment firm in tech.

With a tiny team and almost zero public footprint, they’ve quietly become one
of Elon Musk’s biggest backers, funding SpaceX, xAI, Neuralink, and Twitter/X,
and producing results that most VCs only dream of.

Here’s how they operate and why they matter:

**Lean team, massive returns:** Vy runs with just 4 core investors and about
20 total staff, split between California, London, and Dubai. Despite this,
they’ve managed $15B AUM and posted an average 28% annual return over 10
years, doubling the S&P 500.

**All-in on Musk** : They’re not just passive investors. Vy backed SpaceX at a
$15B valuation (now ~$400B), put $700M into Twitter/X, and has large stakes in
Neuralink and xAI. Some estimates suggest over half of Vy’s portfolio is tied
to Musk-led ventures.

**Minimalist by design:** Their website is a single page. No media interviews.
No pitch decks. Just quiet, outsized results.

**Closed to outsiders now:** After compounding billions, Vy recently told its
LPs it won’t raise more outside capital. They’re now investing their own
money, a rare move in venture.

**Not just US bets:** Vy was also an early investor in Zomato and Urban
Company in India, as well as fintech company Upgrade, AI chipmaker Cerebras,
and cyber-insurance firm Coalition.

**What makes Vy different?** They operate more like a high-trust family office
than a traditional VC. Back the right people early. Keep the team small. Skip
the noise. And ride long-term conviction to outsized outcomes. ([Read

The US venture secondary market is no longer a side corridor; it’s becoming
one of the main liquidity engines of the private markets. PitchBook’s new [US
VC Secondary Market Watch
reports](https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q3-2025-us-vc-secondary-market-
watch) the market hit $95B in annual value in Q3’25, with deal flow
accelerating as startups stay private longer and liquidity pressure builds
across the ecosystem.

And this time, Wall Street isn’t watching, it’s buying.

**What’s driving the surge**

Secondary transactions for direct company stakes jumped 31% QoQ, fueled by
rising valuations for top AI, defence, and fintech startups. Investors across
the spectrum — from Goldman Sachs to retail buyers are crowding into
secondaries to access companies that remain private far longer than they did a
decade ago.

This pressure is structural: with $3.7T still locked in unicorn equity and
limited IPO/M&A activity, secondaries are becoming the default liquidity
valve.

**Wall Street’s big move**

Major financial institutions have entered the market in force:

  * Goldman Sachs acquired Industry Ventures, marking the first time a top-tier bank bought a dedicated VC secondaries firm.

  * Morgan Stanley purchased EquityZen to expand private market access for its wealth clients.

  * Charles Schwab acquired Forge Global, signalling that retail-oriented demand is now mainstream.

These moves give banks a direct foothold in a market where investor appetite
is only growing.

**The SPV boom**

Retail and small investors are chasing exposure too, through special purpose
vehicles:

  * Secondary SPVs grew 682% in count over the last two years.

  * Capital raised jumped 1,340%, per Sydecar.

This represents a major shift: the secondary market is no longer dominated
only by institutions; it’s becoming a mass-access channel for private company
ownership.

**But the market is extremely top-heavy**

Despite the growth, the liquidity is not evenly distributed:

Outside elite AI, defence, and fintech names, most companies still trade at
deep discounts, if they trade at all.

**What this means for the venture ecosystem**

  * Secondaries now represent 32% of primary exit value over the last 12 months, a historic shift.

  * Yet the overall market is still only 2.2% of total unicorn valuations.

  * Given the sheer amount of value trapped in late-stage startups, secondaries are set to become a core pillar of VC, not a stopgap.

In other words: liquidity isn’t returning through IPOs anytime soon — but it
_is_ being rebuilt through secondaries.

##### **SOMETHING MORE**

Most founders hit a point where shipping velocity slows, and the default
reaction is: hire more engineers. However, adding headcount also introduces
complexity — including culture shifts, coordination overhead, and increased
burn. An alternative that’s starting to look real: treat AI agents like junior
hires.

That’s exactly what Linktree did. Going into 2025 planning, they [faced
pressure to scale their engineering
team](https://www.firstround.com/ai/linktree) beyond 100 people. Instead, they
froze hiring at ~190 total employees and leaned hard into AI. Here’s what they
found:

  * **Where it delivered value**

    * **Repetitive engineering tasks:** Their AI agent (Devin) now contributes ~2 PRs per engineer per week, especially for dependency upgrades, bug fixes, and debugging.

    * **Faster prototyping:** Engineers use it to quickly spike new features or test fixes — not production-ready, but good for grounding discussions and estimation.

    * **Security scanning:** AI helps detect and patch vulnerabilities across repos, saving the small security team countless hours.

  * **Where it failed**

    * **Complex or messy systems:** Inconsistent schemas and tech debt confused the AI, making outputs worse. The team had to clean up naming conventions, event schemas, and APIs first.

    * **Over-ambitious projects:** Attempts to auto-generate pixel-perfect pages failed. AI is powerful, but not a replacement for high-craft work.

  * **The real cost**  
AI adoption didn’t “just happen.” The CTO tracked usage dashboards, nudged
laggards, reframed AI as a junior teammate to manage, and created social
pressure (AI demo meetings, “Wins and Whoopsies” Slack channel).

**The takeaway:** Hiring an AI agent _is worth it_ — but only if you:

  1. Point it at repetitive, low-leverage work.

  2. Clean your tech debt so it has good patterns to learn from.

  3. Actively drive adoption across the team.

For Linktree, the payoff was clear: more launches without more hires, 25x
cheaper moderation, and customer support scaling 80% with AI. For most
startups, that’s a strong case to at least experiment with “hiring” an AI
teammate. ([Read detailed report

Fundraising isn’t about optics. It’s about showing investors you can figure it
out. Here’s how they pattern-match across stages (shared by [Amanda
Zhu](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zhu-amanda_after-my-last-doc-dozens-of-
founders-messaged-
activity-7322636978938630144-KFpS?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADSZgeABxlwMnuq8n-_LND05e9NXan-
Jdvo)):

Investors aren’t scanning for perfection. They’re looking for proof you’ll
figure it out.

It took 2–3 months and multiple tests to refine this. But now it’s a
repeatable, scalable framework for startup founders doing outbound.

Here’s the breakdown that worked:

  1. **Subject**

Keep it ultra-relevant and close to the customer’s world. Use a combo like
`Company Name + Service` to make it feel specific, not generic.

  2. **Opening**

Use a short personalised line that references what they do. You don’t need
deep research, find one shared pattern (like “saw your events page”) and
connect it to your service with a simple question.

  3. **Pain**

Call out a real frustration they likely deal with daily. The more vivid and
true it feels, the more they’ll read.

  4. **Solution**

Share who you are, what your tool solves, and a simple result (“grew
conversions by 10%”). If you’re the founder, mention it; people respond better
to founders than SDRs.

  5. **Question**

End with an easy A/B choice: “Want a one-pager or a quick 60s demo?” Avoid
generic yes/no.

One visual (like a product GIF) can boost replies too; use sparingly in small
batches. ([Read full post here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/oliver-

Most founders overthink launches. They keep tinkering, waiting for “perfect,”
and end up stuck in stealth. Claire Butler, Figma’s first marketer,
[says](https://review.firstround.com/how-to-launch-your-startup-out-of-
stealth/) the opposite is true: momentum beats perfection.

Here’s her framework for stepping out of stealth without stalling:

**1\. Set a date, even if it feels early**

  * Don’t wait for every feature to be done—just reach “critical mass.”

  * Figma launched without multiplayer (its core feature) to avoid stagnation.

  * Rule of thumb: if you’re not slightly embarrassed, you’ve waited too long.

**2\. Create three forcing-function artifacts**

  * **Website** : One homepage + about/careers. Define tone, positioning, CTA. (Waitlist vs sign-up vs talk to sales?)

  * **Announcement post** : Founder-written narrative → why you built it, why now, where it’s headed.

  * **Social post** : Distill it all into a single screenshot, video, or punchy tagline. If it feels fluffy, rewrite until it’s authentic.

**3\. Pick launch channels wisely**

  * Focus where your ICP already hangs out (Reddit, Discord, LinkedIn, Twitter/X).

  * Use founder accounts to amplify first—brand handles start from zero.

  * Press is optional. Unless tied to funding, don’t waste time chasing exclusives.

**4\. Seed amplification before launch**

  * Build a list: friends, beta users, influencers, your network.

  * Tell them when launch is, what you’ll need, and share links day-of.

  * Momentum spreads outward from your circle—plan it, don’t wing it.

**5\. Remember: launch ≠ finish line**

  * Monitor replies, engage, and bookmark supporters for ongoing community building.

  * Don’t obsess over metrics too soon—track impressions, traffic, sign-ups, but focus on vibes + momentum.

  * A flashy launch ≠ product-market fit. The real game starts after.

A launch is a forcing function, not a final exam. Prep your date, artefacts,
channels, and amplification. Then get out there; momentum matters more than
perfection.
