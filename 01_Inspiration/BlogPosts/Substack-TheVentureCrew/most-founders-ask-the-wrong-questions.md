##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

Top-performing founders know a key secret: when meeting with VCs, don't just
focus on securing their money—focus on learning from them.

Most VC meetings won't end with a check, but that doesn't mean they're a waste
of time. Each meeting is a chance to build your company using the insights you
gain from the VC, not just the funding you might receive.

Remember, investors have seen countless startups, invested in many, and have a
broad view of the market. That experience is incredibly valuable, and it’s
right there in front of you. They hear and see things that you might not. This
wealth of knowledge is yours to tap into—you just need to ask the right
questions.

Yet, many founders make the mistake of only asking, “How long will it take to
get a response?”

I’ve noticed that some founders approach VC meetings as if the investors are
above them, rushing through the meeting like it’s a rapid-fire round. Don’t do
that. Approach the meeting with the right mindset: come in as an equal, ready
to collaborate and engage in meaningful discussion.

**Here are a few of my suggestions for making the most of your VC meetings:**

> Spend the first part of the meeting explaining what you know about your
> business—focus on sharing insights, not just pitching. The majority of the
> time should be used to ask the VC questions and engage in a collaborative
> dialogue.
>
> Aim for a ratio like this: If you have 10 minutes, explain for 4 and discuss
> for 6. If you have 30 minutes, explain for 8 and discuss for 22. If you have
> an hour, explain for 12 minutes and discuss for the rest. Keep a large
> appendix in your deck for reference during the discussion.

To help founders get into the right mindset, I’ve pulled (Shared by GP)
together a few questions that have seen in pitch meetings. These are questions
every founder should consider asking when meeting with VCs. We’re sharing them
to encourage founders to start real conversations and build genuine
relationships with investors—from the very first meeting. Remember, these
relationships could last decades, even if the VC doesn’t invest this time.

More than just asking these questions, it’s crucial to approach meetings with
a mindset focused on learning and finding the right fit between the founder
and the VC.

How you phrase things can make a difference. Try asking from the perspective
of “this company I’ve shown you,” as that’s how the VC views it.

**Understanding How Your Company Is Perceived**

  1. You have a busy schedule and many meetings. What made you want to take this one? What were you hoping to learn?

  2. Does my deck accurately reflect the business as I’ve described it today?

  3. How would you describe this business to your partners?

  4. What concerns might your partners have when they review this business?

  5. How does this company fit within your current portfolio?

**Turning the Tables**

  8. Is there anything you think I’m underestimating or being overly optimistic about?

  9. What are the main risks or barriers to success you see? Any concerns that might lead you not to invest?

  10. Based on what I’ve shared, do you see any patterns (good or bad) from similar businesses?

  11. How many companies have you seen targeting the same sector?

  12. Have you seen similar businesses succeed or fail recently?

  13. How common is this idea? Have you encountered anything like it before?

  14. Does this startup remind you of any successful companies? Any analogies that come to mind?

  15. Are there companies this startup could naturally partner with now or soon?

  16. Is anything in this business aligning with trends you’re seeing elsewhere?

  17. Now that you’ve heard more about the business, what sectors would you place it in?

  18. Does our TAM (Total Addressable Market) calculation make sense to you?

  19. Here’s how we calculated TAM—do you see another way to approach it?

  20. Could we redefine our market to make it larger, like Airbnb going from home rentals to hotels?

  21. What do you think of the niche we’re targeting? Is there a sub-segment where you see strong potential?

  22. Do you think this could be a billion-dollar company? Why or why not?

  23. I’m considering adding a few smaller checks from angels and advisors to this round. Can you think of anyone who would be valuable to advise me, even if you don’t invest? (I’m not asking for an introduction.)

  24. Besides your firm, who do you think would be the ideal investor for this type of business? Does anyone specific come to mind? (Again, not asking for an introduction.)

  25. If you had someone else help you evaluate this company, whose opinion would you trust?

  26. I know the chances of you investing are slim, but out of curiosity, who else do you think I should be talking to?

  27. What’s the main metric that would prove this is a solid business?

  28. What traction metrics would make investing a no-brainer? Where do we stand on the proof ladder based on what you know?

  29. What’s your experience with companies using the distribution channels I’m planning to use? What lessons have you learned from them?

  30. If this company is worth $2B in the future, what path do you think it would have taken to get there?

  31. On a scale of 1 to 10, how strong do you think our founder-market or founder-product fit is?

  32. Based on our meeting, do I seem like the kind of person who can make this business succeed?

  33. How does my team compare to other teams you’ve invested in?

  34. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the team I’ve built so far?

  35. Who would you recommend adding to this team within the next year?

  36. What cultural traits do you think are essential for this company’s success? Should we be aggressive, careful, highly compliant, rule-breaking, sales-driven, or tech-driven?

The best meetings VCs have with founders are collaborative, not one-sided
pitches. They feel like conversations between equals, setting the stage for a
potential 7-10-year partnership to build something great.

When you ask VCs about your company, listen to their feedback without becoming
defensive. Embracing criticism and overcoming the fear of rejection can make
the fundraising process far more valuable.

Consider using some of the questions from this list that resonate with you and
will help you gain deeper insights into your business from the VC’s
perspective.

We’ve also built multiple guides and frameworks that can be helpful to you in
your startup journey:

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

NFX recently published an excellent piece titled "[How Venture Capital 3.0
Impacts Founders in the AI Age](https://www.nfx.com/post/venture-capital-3)
_"_ by James Currier. It’s worth a full read, but I’ve distilled the key
shifts — along with what they might mean if you’re building or raising right
now.

The first big point: it’s never been a better time to raise capital. We’ve
moved from a world of 150 VCs in the mid-90s to over thousands active
investors today. This isn't just about tech bros with checkbooks. It's a sign
that venture has become a widely adopted financing tool — not just for
software, but for climate, defense, space, bio, and more.

Founders benefit from this competition: more capital chasing deals means
better valuations, more support, and a growing appetite for outlier ideas.

Despite media narratives about a slowdown, NFX argues the VC industry will
continue expanding.

Why? Because inefficiency still exists in early-stage investing — meaning
returns are still attractive. New LPs are entering. VC is spreading across
geographies and sectors. AI is making it easier to identify opportunities, and
the job itself still attracts top talent. In short, the structural drivers for
growth are strong. Even if returns normalize, the sheer number of players is
likely to grow.

We’re now in Venture Capital 3.0.

  * The first era was a cottage industry, small and low-profile. 

  * VC 2.0 scaled with the rise of software and the internet — blogs, Twitter, accelerators, and TechCrunch helped demystify fundraising. 

  * VC 3.0, which kicked off around 2022, is defined by ubiquity. Venture is everywhere — touching every sector and becoming deeply intertwined with AI.

But the nature of the game is also changing. Software, in many ways, was the
perfect VC product — fast to build, scalable, high margins, winner-take-all
dynamics. New sectors will require more grit from founders and more rigor from
investors.

If software was the gold rush, these new frontiers are more like hard rock
mining. The 100x returns will still exist — but they’ll be harder to find and
take longer to build.

Another shift is cultural. As mega-funds emerge, some will begin to behave
more like private equity firms — structured deals, more control, less romance.
Founders may increasingly face investors who optimize for efficiency rather
than vision.

It’s not necessarily bad, but the personality and incentives of your investor
will matter more than ever.

Then there’s AI. It’s already reshaping how VCs work — from sourcing and
evaluating deals to portfolio support. VCs are moving from passive to
proactive, reaching out cold to founders based on digital signals like
LinkedIn updates or revenue milestones. You may find yourself fielding
outreach earlier than ever before — often from firms you've never met. AI will
also influence how decisions get made. While few firms openly admit it, AI
will increasingly help filter, score, and compare investment opportunities.

There is a bear case: too much money chasing too few great startups, rising
valuations, shrinking alpha, fewer IPOs, and an eventual reversion to a
smaller, more concentrated industry dominated by 20 large funds. But NFX is
betting that the opposite happens — that the inefficiencies, new LP flows,
sector expansion, and AI-fueled deal flow will drive continued growth.

So what does all this mean for you if you're building? The good news:

  * you’ll likely raise at higher valuations, 

  * you’ll see more investor interest, and 

  * more VCs will go out of their way to offer help. 

They have to — it’s competitive out there.

The flip side: you’ll also face more competition from well-funded peers, some
investors may act more like operators than partners, and navigating inbound
interest will require real focus. Being in demand is great — but distraction
is expensive.

Dilution probably won’t change much. Valuations will rise, but so will round
sizes, and the ownership math still has to work for funds. What will change is
how much capital you have access to and how early it might come. Whether
that’s helpful or harmful will depend on your ability to stay disciplined.

As a founder, you're probably eager to wrap up your round and get back to
building your company. Makes sense - fundraising can be a huge time sink.

One powerful strategy I've seen work well is using tranches. Let me break down
what this means and how you can use it effectively.

**What exactly are tranches?** Simply put, tranches are different pricing
tiers in your fundraising round. Instead of raising everything at one
valuation, you segment your raise into parts. The early investors usually get
in at a lower valuation, creating an incentive for quick decisions.

**Why consider using tranches?** Early-stage startups are inherently risky,
and getting that first check is often the biggest hurdle. VCs tend to move
faster when they see other investors already committed. By offering early
investors a better deal, you're not just rewarding them - you're creating
momentum for your entire raise.

**How do investors typically react?** Most sophisticated investors understand
the game. They know that whether they got in at $5M or $10M won't matter much
if the company becomes really valuable. That said, there are some unwritten
rules:

  * Never offer worse terms to later investors than what early ones got

  * Be honest about your strategy and intentions

  * Don't string investors along just to create FOMO

**What's the best way to communicate new tranches?** Keep it natural.
Something like: "We opened a small initial allocation to move quickly, and now
we're raising the rest at a fair cap." Or if you're extending the round,
"We're seeing strong interest beyond our initial target, so we're considering
taking on additional capital while managing dilution."

**How many tranches should you use?** Keep it simple - two or three maximum.
Any more gets messy and complicated to manage.

**How should you size each tranche?** You've got three main approaches:

  * Small first tranche, bigger second (great for speed)

  * Large first tranche, small follow-on (better for controlling dilution)

  * Flexible sizing based on market response (good when you're testing the waters)

Remember, tranches are just a tool to help you close your round efficiently.
Used thoughtfully, they can create positive momentum and get you back to
focusing on what really matters - building your company.

Landing pages are one of the most overlooked assets in an early-stage
startup’s journey. But they matter—a lot. Your landing page is often the first
thing investors, potential users, and early hires see. It communicates what
you’re building, who it’s for, and why it matters—all in under 30 seconds.

And yet, many founders treat it as an afterthought. They focus heavily on
product, which makes sense, but forget that messaging and design are how your
product earns its first shot. The most common mistakes? Being too vague, too
technical, or too “cool.” A great landing page doesn’t try to be clever—it
works hard to be clear.

[Maximilian Fleitmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximilian-fleitmann/)
recently shared a swipe file of landing pages from the YC Winter 2024 batch.
It features over 140 startups that have collectively raised more than $200
million. We went through it and found a lot to learn—especially in how these
teams write headlines, structure their messaging, and guide visitors to take
action.

These aren’t just well-designed pages—they’re great examples of how early-
stage startups communicate clearly, build trust, and create momentum from day
one.

If you’re launching soon, raising capital, or just want to sharpen how you
present your startup, this is one of the best collections out there.
