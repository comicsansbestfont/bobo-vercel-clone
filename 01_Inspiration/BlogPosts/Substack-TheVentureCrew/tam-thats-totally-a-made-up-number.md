##### **FROM OUR PARTNER**

Data Engineering is no longer just a backstage player but is taking centre
stage in the VC space.

It is about constructing and maintaining the architectures (think databases,
large-scale processing systems) that allow for data availability—a cornerstone
for insightful analysis and well-informed decisions.  

**Turning raw data into usable outputs and insights** has great use cases for
deal sourcing, due diligence, or portfolio monitoring.

##### **TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

> Every Founder, “This is a trillion dollar total addressable market.,”
>
> “If only we can capture 1% of trillion dollar market, We’re going TO BE
> RICH!”

While it may sound enticing, this mindset is known as the "**1% market
fallacy** ," and it's a common mistake many startups make. If you find
yourself thinking that focusing on 1% of a trillion dollars will make you
rich, you're falling into this trap.

It's easy to understand why the allure of a large, rapidly expanding market
can be captivating. Founders often get excited about the sheer size of the
opportunity and believe that securing even a tiny fraction of that market will
guarantee a substantial payday. But let's take a closer look at why this line
of thinking can be misleading.

**So What’s the Problem With Saying You’ll Capture 1% Of A Giant Market?**

First and foremost, 1% of a large market is still a significant number.
Achieving such a milestone requires considerable resources, effort, and time.
Merely stating the intention to capture 1% of a massive market does not
automatically translate into achieving that goal. It's crucial to recognize
that without a clear focus or differentiation, a startup may find itself lost
in a vast landscape, struggling to gain traction and relevance.

Furthermore, **assuming that capturing a small slice of a vast pie is an
easily attainable goal is a fallacy in itself.** If it were truly that simple,
everyone would be doing it.

The reality is that building a successful startup and capturing a significant
portion of any market is a complex and challenging endeavour. It requires
strategic thinking, a deep understanding of customer needs, relentless
execution, and continuous adaptation.

One more challenge with focusing on a big market is that most early-stage
startups (and even later-stage ones) have no legitimate unfair advantage. You
quickly become another player in the space clawing to get that mythical 1%
market share.

**You should never start a company on a level playing field.**

It makes no sense to jump into a market without any advantage whatsoever, and
yet many people do. They see a gigantic market, figure they’re smart and
capable, and go for it. Those founders usually get chewed up. While a lot of
startups aim to compete on speed versus incumbents it’s rarely enough on its
own.

one that focuses on capturing a substantial share of a smaller, well-defined
market. By narrowing their focus, startups can better understand their target
customers, tailor their offerings to meet their specific needs and develop a
competitive advantage. This approach allows for a more concentrated effort,
optimizing resources and increasing the likelihood of success.

Starting with a smaller market segment provides several advantages. Firstly,
it enables startups to gain a deep understanding of their customers and build
strong relationships. By delivering exceptional value to a specific group, a
startup can create a loyal customer base that acts as a foundation for future
growth. Success within this niche market can also provide valuable insights
and a proof of concept that can be leveraged to expand into adjacent markets.

Secondly, by establishing a solid presence in a smaller market, startups can
build credibility and a reputation for excellence. Customers are more likely
to trust and engage with a company that demonstrates a deep understanding of
their needs and consistently delivers outstanding products or services. This
reputation can serve as a launchpad for further growth and market expansion.

Once a startup has secured a significant share of a specific market, it can
then consider expanding its reach. Armed with a clear understanding of
customer preferences, feedback, and emerging trends, the company can
strategically target new market segments or even disrupt adjacent industries.
This approach allows for more calculated expansion, reducing the risk of
spreading resources too thin or losing sight of the company's core strengths.

In conclusion, the 1% market fallacy is a misconception that can lead startups
astray. Instead of aiming for a tiny piece of a vast pie, entrepreneurs should
prioritize capturing a substantial portion of a smaller, well-defined market.
By focusing their efforts and resources on understanding and delivering value
to a specific customer base, startups can lay a solid foundation for growth
and expansion. Once success is achieved in one market segment, the lessons
learned and the reputation built can be harnessed to conquer new challenges.

Remember, building a successful startup is not about grabbing a small piece of
a giant pie; it's about creating an irresistible recipe that resonates deeply
with a specific group of customers. Start small, think big!

I appreciate the appeal of big markets. Those 💰💰💰 look so exciting!

But chasing a big market—certainly early on—is a mistake.

  * It’s hard to define a big market and understand your place in it. TAM, SAM, and SOM are generic and don’t do justice to how markets operate.

  * Focusing on a big market likely means you have a superficial understanding of users/customers, their needs and what will get them to try & buy your solution.

  * You set what seems like reasonable expectations (i.e. 1% of a big market) but it’s a meaningless number, and still almost impossible to achieve.

  * You have no real advantage in a giant market because there are too many competitors with too much money, history and control.

_So, what should you do?_

Define your niche:

Rather than pursuing a broad market, identify a specific segment where you can
excel. Understand the unique needs and pain points of your target customers
and develop a tailored solution that addresses them effectively. By becoming
the go-to provider in a niche market, you can establish a strong foundation
for future growth.

##### **TODAY’S QUICK DIVE**

Europe's deep tech sector leads in research publications (28.1%), surpassing
the US and China. Despite a higher percentage of STEM graduates, Europe
struggles to commercialize breakthroughs.

**Encouraging scientists to enter venture capital (VC)** is seen as a key
driver for innovation. With substantial government pledges (e.g., France €2.5
billion, Germany €1 billion, UK £3.5 billion), Europe aims for success. STEM
graduates are crucial in VC, given the data-driven nature of deep tech.
Challenges for scientist VCs include understanding business, accessing
networks, overcoming cultural barriers, and gaining trust. Overcoming these
challenges could lead to collaborative innovation, aligning with objective
data over marketing dominance…**[More Here](https://tech.eu/2024/02/10/europe-

Nvidia has experienced an astonishing surge, with a $600 billion increase in
value over the past two months, propelling its market cap to $1.7 trillion.
This valuation is on par with the combined worth of all Chinese-listed
companies on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

**Nvidia's market cap has nearly quadrupled** since the beginning of the
previous year, with a remarkable 239% stock increase in 2023 and an additional
41% uptick this year. In contrast, China's economic challenges have resulted
in a 26% decline in the Hang Seng index over the last year. Despite this, Bank
of America sees potential for investors in select Chinese stocks with strong
management, robust balance sheets, and solid earnings, drawing parallels to
Japan's Nikkei collapse in the early 1990s, where a specific group of
companies rallied to a 400% bull market.

In a recent study by [Carta
](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7163215930636943361/)\-
In Q4 2023, 89% of pre-seed funding (under $1 million) used Simple Agreements
for Future Equity (SAFEs), surpassing convertible notes.

The surge in SAFE adoption since Q1 2020 reflects a dominant trend, especially
in SaaS, Fintech, Gaming, and Edtech, where SAFEs constituted over 90% of
funding. Notably, Medical Devices, Pharma/Biotech, and Energy still relied on
convertible notes for at least 30% of funding. The shift is driven by founders
raising multiple SAFE rounds before turning to priced equity, a strategy seen
in 4 to 5 rounds before their first priced round.

##### **FEATURED POST**

Being first in the market is often seen as a competitive advantage, but how
real is this? For example, do you have to be first – new product, service,
market?  

Moving quickly and striving to establish your business as the ‘go-to’
product/solution in a new market sounds like a competitive advantage, **but
the reality is often different**.

**What History Taught Us** ,  
If you study any new industry, you will find that most pioneers didn’t build
truly great products/services, incumbents did!  

**Example** : Apple was relatively late to the smartphone market. Blackberry,
Nokia, and Windows had at least five years of a head start on the first iPhone
– released in 2007. By 2009, the iPhone surpassed Blackberry sales.… **[Read
