##### **📜 DEEP DIVE**

When it comes to building a startup, one of the things that comes to a
founder’s mind is creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to test whether
their solution to a particular problem is valid or not. However, one of the
common mistakes I observe founders making is **forgetting about the "Viable"
part and just focusing on the product.**  

This common mistake is observed in 90% of startup founders and the rest 10% of
founders who know how to build MVP become startups like Airbnb, twich & stripe
etc.

Also, most of the founders mistaken the meaning of MVP - that it’s about
considering one feature and building a product. Actually - It’s more than
that!

So - In this, we will deep dive into -

  * Real Meaning of Building Minimal Viable Product (MVP)

  * How did Airbnb, Twitch, and Stripe build their MVPs?

  * How did these startups use the Y-Combinator MVP building strategy?

  * How can you build the MVP for your startup?

So grab your coffee and let’s deep dive into it!

**What is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)?**

A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough
features to be usable by early customers …— Wikipedia

**What should be your MVP mindset In the Pre-Launch Stage?**

Let’s start with the meme above. It’s called the **midwit** meme.

Many first-time founders (the guy to the left of the bell curve) launch
quickly and iterate (continue launching quickly). This is the same for the
expert founder (the guy to the right of the bell curve).

But the guy in the middle is the “ _smart founder_ ”. Let’s call him Benny.
Benny wants to do surveys, raise money, build a team, etc. He wants to do it
all. Benny learns after a while he should have been like the “dumb guys”.

> As a founder, you want to build an MVP, get it to customers, and learn if it
> helps them or not. Then iterate.

You only really _start learning about your users when you put a product in
front of them._ Not by doing 1000 surveys, gathering a mailing list, or
fundraising for half a year.

The amazing thing, your MVP might not even work how you want it to.

**Your goal as an early-stage founder:**

  * Launch quickly. (MVP)

  * Get your first customers.

  * Talk To Customers & Get Feedback

  * Iterate (Improve the product)

These goals need to be your guiding principle.  

Expect that after 3–5 iterations, your MVP would have changed so much. But
that’s a good thing. It means you’ve been listening to your customers.

Try and remember that you are not the hero of your customer’s story. You’re
not Harry Potter, you’re Dumbledore who gives him the tools to be the hero of
his own story. You serve at the pleasure of the customer.

**Is an MVP really the way to go?**

Many founders want to build a product (like the iPhone) that blows people out
of the water at once. That’s a very steep hill to climb though.

The MVP approach is best. You might have a question that -

**But What If My MVP Is Rubbish and they Never Want To Talk To Me Again?**

Even the biggest startups had this same fear. YC deals with it every time.
It’s okay that you feel this fear. But never act on it.

FEAR- False Expectations Appearing Real

Think about it. If one customer doesn’t like your product, does that kill your
startup? No. You can reach out to another customer. You can reach out to the
same customer after you’ve made the product better.

The more amazing thing is that most people who speak with startups at an early
stage are early adopters. They try out products that are in their rubbish
phase. They are used to products not working quite as well as they should.

Early users usually have a problem. They are the only ones brave enough to try
untested products that could solve the problem. They are usually there for the
long haul to give you feedback on how to make the product better.

**Fake Steve Jobs -**

These types of founders think they know exactly what the customer needs. Let’s
call them fake Steves.

In their minds, Steve Jobs built the iPhone and iPod, such amazing products in
one go. The mistake they're making is that’s not true. Many of them remember
the 3rd or 4th iteration of these products. The first iPhone had 2G internet,
no app store, etc.

You don’t know what the customer needs. The customer alone knows what they
need. If you ask them, they will tell you. How you ask them is by showing them
your MVP.

**Examples of Successful MVPs**

**1\. Airbnb:**

This is the first version of AirBnB. They didn’t have a lot of features. If
you were an early adopter, here was what you enjoyed.

  * No payment system.

  * No map view. You couldn’t see where the house was in the city.

  * You had to sleep on an airbed. The whole house could not be rented to you.

  * It was only for conferences.

**2\. Twitch:**

Twitch was the world's leading video platform and community for gamers.

But they’re now one of the most popular streaming websites in the world.

**Do you know what thing they focused on at the pre-launch stage?**

Software MVP

  * Very fast to build (weeks not months)

  * Very limited functionality

  * Appeal to a small set of users

They built a product that people loved, not one that everyone loved. It didn’t
solve all the problems. Solve problems step by step.

**Who Are These Early Adopters? Why Do They Want To Go Through So Much Pain?**

“You want to build your product for customers who have their hair on fire.”
What product would you want to buy from me?

Maybe a hose, bucket of water, or something that can bring water. Well, all I
have is a brick (my MVP). Walking away won’t even cross your mind. You’re
desperate, you’ll buy the brick and hit yourself on the head to kill the fire.

The early adopters are the desperate ones. Forget the ones that are not
desperate.

**Why surveys don’t work.**

You might have had a formal business school education. Now you’re thinking
let’s do a survey and learn everything the user needs. Then we build it.

That won’t work either.**** The customer doesn’t know everything about the
answer to their problem. They don’t even know everything about the problem
itself. If they did, don’t you think they would build the solution on their
own or hire people to do it for them?

It’s your job to know.**** Surveys help you find out your users' pain but not
how to solve it. Only a product can do that.

You give them a product and ask, does this solve your problem? Yes or no and  
you go down the scientific method flow chart from there.

**How To Build An MVP Quickly!**

Give yourself a timeframe. It’s easier to move on if you do. If you allow
endless time to build, you’ll never stop building the MVP.

Don’t keep doing a double take while building. Write everything you want to
build down now. Then you won’t have to rethink everything later.

At this point, you will cut many features. Think how important is this to
solve the user’s problem.

A startup to solve overseas payments doesn't need a chat feature in the MVP.
Neither does it need APIs connected to every bank in the world. Both are
important but can be skipped for the MVP.

**Don’t fall in love with your MVP.**

Have you heard married couples say something like: this is not the person I
married or fell in love with?

Please please please don’t fall in love with your MVP.

It will change so much as you’re iterating.

If you’re in love with it, you won't want it to change. You’re building an
emotional barrier to your growth.

**Final Thoughts**

“It’s better to have 100 customers that really love your product than 100k
that are just ok with it.” — Michael Seibel, Y-Combinator

Those 100 will give you rich feedback that you need to grow. Build for them
and the others will come when you have a shiny product.

All these concepts are covered in the

##### **📄 QUICK WIN**

Too many founders spend weeks polishing ideas the market doesn’t want. You
don’t need perfect data to spot a weak bet; you need a fast, honest pass that
forces clarity on market reality, customer truth, positioning, and go-to-
market.

Below is a tight, copy-paste stack you can run in ChatGPT to pressure-test any
idea in under 30 minutes.

How to run the 30-minute sprint:

  1. Set the mode (3 minutes)

  2. Market reality check (8 minutes)

  3. Define the customer (6 minutes)

  4. Write value props (4 minutes)

  5. Find the wedge vs competitors (6 minutes)

  6. Pick GTM mode (3 minutes)

> **Outcome:** a cold recommendation (Go / No-Go) with enough evidence to kill
> weak ideas quickly or move strong ones to deeper work.

**Prompt 1 — set the operating mode, Copy-paste:**

    You are my marketing strategist, growth specialist, creative director, and positioning expert. For every response:

    • Think critically.
    • Challenge assumptions.
    • Speak like a seasoned operator. When you use an acronym, include the full form in brackets (e.g., CPL (cost per lead)).
    • Offer structured feedback, not just answers.
    • After each output, add a short “Teach me” paragraph explaining the why.

    Commit this business to long-term memory:
    “My business is called [INSERT BRAND NAME]. I help [AUDIENCE] solve [CORE PROBLEM] by offering [PRODUCT/SERVICE]. You will build on each new detail as we go.”

    My marketing skill level is [BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED]. Adapt technical depth to my level but keep the strategist’s viewpoint. If I’m beginner or intermediate, define acronyms briefly in-line.

    Do not suggest next prompts unless asked. Always revert to this role for all future replies in this chat.

**Prompt 2 — market reality evaluator**

Purpose: remove optimism bias, ground the idea in public knowledge and
business logic. Copy-paste:

    Enter Market Reality Evaluator mode. Do not soften bad news or over-validate weak markets. Use credible public knowledge (2023+), trained inference, and structured business logic.

    Evaluate my market and tell me if it’s worth entering.

    What I sell:
    [One-line product summary — e.g., “A digital course that helps freelancers write faster with GPT.”]

    Who I sell to:
    [Target audience in plain terms]

    What I know (optional edge data):
    [Competitor prices, COGS (cost of goods sold), ad costs, performance signals, user data, internal benchmarks]

    My estimated pricing:
    [If you have it]

    Return the following, with concise evidence under each:
    • Estimated Total Addressable Market (TAM)
    • Category maturity (Emerging / Growth / Plateau / Decline)
    • Market saturation level (Low / Medium / High)
    • Dominant players (Top 5) with market share/gross revenue/costs/margins (best available estimates)
    • Market growth rate (% or trendline)
    • Buyer sophistication (Impulse / Solution-aware / Skeptical)
    • Purchase frequency (One-off / Repeat / Recurring)
    • Pricing ceiling (based on value and competition)
    • Viable acquisition channels (SEO, Paid, Organic, Influencer, Partnerships, etc.)
    • Estimated CAC ranges per viable channel
    • Suggested CLV target for sustainable CAC
    • Strategic opportunity mode (Steal / Expand / Defend / Stimulate)
    • Overall difficulty score (1–10)
    • Clear recommendation: Go or No-Go, with brief, cold reasoning

    Bonus (if I provide margin data like “COGS = $22”):
    • Profit per sale
    • Breakeven CAC
    • Minimum conversion rate needed from ads

    End with a brief “Teach me” note explaining how you arrived at each call.

**Prompt 3 — define the customer (use only the frameworks that fit)**

Purpose: capture reality, not fantasy; choose frameworks by model. Copy-paste:

    Based on the product above, define the ideal customer using only the most relevant frameworks. Choose from:
    • SaaS/service: Jobs to Be Done (JTBD), Awareness Levels (Schwartz), Hormozi first principles
    • DTC/brand-led: Brand Archetypes, Psychographics, Empathy Map
    • High-ticket B2B: First Principles, Awareness Levels, Moat Thinking
    • Content/influencer: Psychographics, Brand Archetypes, Traffic Temperature

    Return the sections below. Label a section with the framework used if helpful (e.g., “(JTBD)” or “(Awareness: Problem-aware)”). Be clear, concise, and non-customer-facing.

    • Demographics (only if decision-relevant): age/role/income/industry/location
    • Psychographics: beliefs, values, aspirations, fears, identity drivers (who they want to become)
    • Core frustrations: what they want to stop feeling/doing/struggling with
    • Primary goals: outcomes, progress, or emotional relief they actively seek
    • Current alternatives: what they use today (including workarounds or “do nothing”)
    • Resonant messaging: tone/promises/insights that land; the beliefs or objections we must shift

    Avoid repeating product features. Focus entirely on the customer. Close with a short “Teach me” note on why these choices matter.

**Prompt 4 — three value propositions under 20 words**

Purpose: make the promise crisp and believable. Copy-paste:

    Write 3 value propositions under 20 words each:

    We help [AUDIENCE] go from [BEFORE STATE] to [AFTER STATE] using [PRODUCT].

    Use the modular logic that fits:
    • SaaS or B2B services: Hormozi’s value equation (dream outcome vs. friction), April Dunford positioning (Alternative → Unique → Value), Awareness Levels (Problem/Solution-aware)
    • DTC/brand-led: Brand Archetypes, Empathy Map + Emotional Ladder, Blair Warren persuasion triggers
    • High-ticket B2B/consulting: First Principles (pain → path → belief shift), Andy Raskin narrative (enemy → promised land), Hormozi objections
    • Creator/influencer: Tribal logic (“people like us…”), identity shift, StoryBrand clarity (hero meets guide)

    Ensure emotional clarity, outcome specificity, and believability. End with a brief “Teach me” note.

**Prompt 5 — pick a defensible wedge vs competitors**

Purpose: find a clear, ownable position with proof. Copy-paste:

    Operate as a Competitive Strategy Analyst.

    Competitors (add if you have them):
    [Competitor 1], [Competitor 2], [Competitor 3]
    Websites:
    [URL 1], [URL 2], [URL 3]

    Analyse each competitor’s homepage and core product messaging. Summarise:
    • Primary value prop (headline + implied promise)
    • Likely axis of competition (e.g., speed, price, power, simplicity, brand)
    • Who they’re really speaking to (persona insight)

    Then propose 3 positioning axes that are unclaimed or under-leveraged. Return a table:

    | Axis | Emotional benefit | Who it’s for | How to prove |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | [e.g., Simplicity at scale] | [Control, calm, clarity] | [Teams with tool fatigue] | [One dashboard; one prompt; full funnel] |
    | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
    | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |

    Close with: “Of these 3, lead with [X] because [strategic rationale].”
    Bonus: include a sharp one-liner to communicate this wedge. End with a “Teach me” note.

**Prompt 6 — choose the GTM mode**

Purpose: align go-to-market with structure, not vibes. Copy-paste:

    Enter GTM Mode Selector. Use prior outputs (market, pricing, positioning, TAM, growth, CAC, wedge).

    My product:
    [Insert if single product]

    Answer:
    1) Most viable GTM mode: Steal, Expand, Defend, or Stimulate
    2) Strategic rationale (structural, not tactical): why this mode fits margins, market shape, and model
    3) Optimise for:
       • Speed vs margin?
       • Awareness vs conversion?
       • Breadth vs depth of messaging?
    4) Modes I should not pursue—and why
    5) GTM difficulty (1–10) with blind spots

    Do not recommend specific tactics yet. End with a “Teach me” note.

**Decision rules (kill or keep)**

  * Kill if growth is flat/declining, saturation is high, or the wedge is trivial.

  * Kill if CLV (customer lifetime value) can’t support CAC (customer acquisition cost) at 3:1 within 6–12 months.

  * Kill if pricing ceiling leaves unsustainably low margins after COGS (cost of goods sold) + discounts.

  * Proceed if there’s a provable wedge, at least one efficient channel with viable CAC, and a path to repeatable revenue.

**Good output looks like**

  * Crisp numbers with sources or reasoned estimates

  * Competitor reads that reveal the true audience

  * Value props sceptics would believe

  * A wedge provable in product/experience

  * A defendable Go / No-Go call

**Pro tips**

  * Bring one edge metric (COGS, CPC, or baseline conversion) to anchor the math

  * Ask for ranges/sensitivity if early (e.g., “show outcomes if CPC is +30%”)

  * Save the chat—compounds as you add more data

If you’re a B2B SaaS founder and not leveraging Reddit, you’re leaving leads
on the table.

I recently came across the Reddit Marketing Guide by [Adam
Shaw](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-shaw-stl/), so I thought to share with
you some key points and my opinion with you. He shared, “Reddit is the #2
source of leads, right after LinkedIn. It’s where people are actively asking
for help and exploring new solutions—unlike LinkedIn, which is more about
storytelling and sharing success.

And here’s the kicker: 50% of my leads come from just answering questions on
Reddit for less than an hour a day.**”**

Here’s how you can do it

**Step 1: Turn Your Profile into a Landing Page**

Your Reddit profile is like a mini landing page. It’s the first place curious
users will go after reading your comments or posts. Make sure it’s optimized
to convert.

**How to set it up:**

  * Choose a username that’s tied to your brand or product.

  * Write an actionable profile name (e.g., “Helping SaaS Founders Scale”).

  * Add a CTA to your profile banner (e.g., “Download our Free SaaS Marketing Guide”).

  * Include your one-line product pitch and CTA in the bio (e.g., “We help SaaS founders grow faster. Subscribe to our newsletter below!”).

  * Add links to key resources like:

    * Lead magnets

    * Newsletter sign-ups

    * Product demo

**Step 2: Find Subreddits Where Your Audience Hangs Out**

Reddit is vast, but your audience is likely concentrated in a handful of niche
subreddits.

**How to find them:**

  1. Use Reddit’s search bar to look for your product keywords (e.g., “SaaS,” “startup growth,” etc.).

  2. Use Google to search for “your keywords + Reddit” (pro tip: Google is better at finding Reddit threads than Reddit itself).

  3. Pick subreddits with active, engaged members in your niche.

**Pro tip:** Use tools like [Gummy
Search](https://gummysearch.com/?via=fdaae0) to automate finding relevant
subreddits and posts.

**Step 3: Prepare a Lead Magnet**

Redditors hate being sold to. They love **value first** approaches.

That’s where a lead magnet comes in. It’s a way to engage your audience
without coming across as too salesy.'

**Examples of great lead magnets:**

  * In-depth guides tailored to specific problems.

  * Free trials of your product.

  * Newsletters with actionable advice (my favorite).

Make it easy for people to commit. For example, I use a newsletter landing
page to capture leads. By the time they get there, I’ve already built trust
through helpful comments.

**Step 4: Start by Commenting, Not Posting**

Engage first, post later.

**Why?** Comments are more personal and allow you to directly connect with
people asking for help. You’ll also learn what your audience really needs.

**How to comment like a pro:**

  * Answer recent posts (24-48 hours old) for better visibility.

  * Avoid crowded posts (0-10 comments is the sweet spot).

  * Add value. Most comments are generic—stand out by being actionable, specific, and helpful.

**Step 5: Be the Best Commenter**

The secret to success on Reddit? Write better comments than everyone else.

**Here’s how:**

  * Be highly relevant—answer only what’s asked.

  * Be specific—don’t just say “try this.” Explain _how_ to try it.

  * Go in-depth—assume the person has zero knowledge.

  * Stay friendly—ignore trolls.

**Make your comment stand out visually too:**

  * Use white space for readability.

  * Add bullet points to organize your thoughts.

  * Be longer than most comments (Reddit loves thoughtful responses).

**Step 6: Post to Curate Conversations**

Once you’ve spent a few weeks commenting, you’ll notice patterns in what your
audience talks about. That’s when you start posting.

But don’t make the mistake of being self-serving. Redditors can smell that a
mile away.

**Here’s what works:**

  * Don’t post a blog or self-promo content. Instead, ask questions that spark engagement.

  * Let the audience share their thoughts and experiences in the comments.

  * Use their responses to build conversations and authority naturally.

Reddit can be a goldmine for B2B SaaS founders if used the right way. Focus on
engagement first, provide value, and let the leads come to you.
