Raising capital is a sales & marketing process. As a founder - Your company is
the product and you’re selling an equity ownership in your company but much
more broadly **you’re selling trust & confidence that you’re going to build
something enormously valuable** and that you’re going to be enjoyable to work
hand-in-hand with over the coming decade of each other’s lives.

Last Saturday (same investor from [the previous
post](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/how-to-talk-about-valuation-
numbers)), I had a brief call with an investor**(called Investor-A for privacy
reasons)** who has over 7 years of experience in the VC. We discussed
valuation numbers and the how founder can improve the odds of getting to yes
from a VC.

He shared some good tactics advice (inside info.. boom) that even I felt that
most of the founders were unaware of. So I thought to share those tactics with
you in this post, So let’s deep dive into it!

**To understand how to “get to yes” with a VC you first need to -**

`Understand how VC partnerships make decisions and then you can understand how
to increase your odds of closing a deal.`

Start by understanding how many partners are at the firm you are approaching.
It’s pretty easy since nearly every VC lists its partners on the website. Some
firms are trickier since they artificially call everybody “partner” but
they’re not all “investment partners.” It’s super easy to suss all this out.

Find a portfolio company or two that they’ve invested in. Find one that’s on
the earlier-stage size or one that was raised a long time ago and never scaled
and get to know the founder & CEO.

They can likely give you the entire playbook of the partnership if you build a
meaningful relationship with them and they trust you. The key to your
“consigliere” is that they can’t be crazy busy because they’re scaling at
meteoric rates.

**What do you want to know?**

  * How many partners are there?

  * Which partners are active and which are less active?

  * Who in the firm has the “pull” to get deals done when they want to?

  * Which partners work well with which other partners?

  * Who are the most optimistic partners and who are the most generally skeptical partners?

  * How does the partnership typically make its final investment decisions?

Each firm makes decisions in different ways so understanding the firm’s
decision framework matters. Some firms are “consensus-driven” and look for
unanimity in the decision or near unanimity. Some partnerships are “conviction
driven” meaning they’re looking for a super-committed partner who will slam
his or her proverbial fist on the table to push through a deal.
