##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

[Matt Lerner,](https://x.com/matthlerner) former growth leader at PayPal and
founder of SYSTM, has helped hundreds of startups figure out one thing: **how
to actually grow.** And his answer is clear — early on, founders need to lead
growth themselves.

It’s a necessary phase. Because when startups fail, it’s often not the market
or the product — it’s that founders didn’t learn fast enough what really
drives traction. And no one can learn that for you.

Founders are deeply involved in product and sales early on — but when it comes
to growth, many try to delegate too soon. Some get stuck in theory and
planning. Some keep building without validating. Others hand growth off to a
hire, expecting them to figure it out.

But the first growth hire can't do their job unless the founder has already
uncovered what works. You don’t bring in someone to scale chaos — you bring
them in to scale signal.

Matt Lerner saw this mistake often as a VC. Founders would pitch go-to-market
strategies that looked impressive on a slide, but didn’t stand up to scrutiny.
There was no evidence behind them — just ideas. And even if one of those ideas
worked, the upside was usually small.

> Lerner’s argument is simple:
>
> **Growth can’t be delegated until you know what works.** You don’t need
> polished strategy decks — you need signal. That comes from firsthand
> experience.

At PayPal, Lerner saw that nearly all of their exponential growth could be
traced back to just a few key levers:

It wasn’t about doing everything. It was about doing the right things — and
finding those things takes founder involvement.

That’s what pushed him to **define the concept of a “growth lever”** — a small
number of activities that drive most of the company’s growth. And finding
those levers is the founder’s responsibility.

Start by mapping your funnel from the moment a user hears about your product
to the moment they find value. You’re looking for drop-offs — the stages where
people get stuck. You don’t need dashboards or analytics tools to do this. A
rough sketch is enough.

What matters is identifying the bottleneck that’s holding back your growth.
Then ask yourself: if this stage improved, how much would it impact the rest
of the funnel?

One example comes from Popsa, a photobook app that Lerner invested in. The
product was solid — users liked it and stuck around. But install rates were
low. The team eventually realized the issue wasn’t the product — it was the
App Store listing. The tagline “Fast, Easy Photo Books” wasn’t specific
enough. People didn’t know what “fast” meant. When they changed it to “Photo
Books in 5 Minutes,” their conversion rate quadrupled.

Small change. Huge outcome. That’s the power of fixing the right bottleneck.

Behavioral data will tell you where people are dropping off. But it won’t tell
you why. That’s where qualitative research comes in.

Lerner leans heavily on the **Jobs to Be Done framework** here. Talk to your
actual customers — not leads who didn’t convert, but people who did. Ask them
what they were trying to accomplish, why it mattered, and what their process
looked like.

You’ll start to uncover patterns — shared goals, repeated anxieties, common
alternatives they considered. This is what helps you position your product and
smoothen your customer journey.

Smart Tales, an educational app for kids, was struggling with conversions.
Customer interviews revealed something surprising: parents didn’t just want
their kids to learn — they wanted to give them screen time without guilt. That
emotional insight shaped the company’s messaging and improved conversion rates
by 65%, without changing the product itself.

Once you know the bottleneck and understand your customer’s mindset, shift
into experimentation. This is where founders often get overwhelmed. There are
endless tactics and ideas. But Lerner simplifies it into weekly growth
sprints.

Each sprint is designed to answer one question: **does this change improve a
meaningful metric?**

The structure is simple:

  * Start with an observation and hypothesis

  * Make a team prediction

  * Run the experiment for a week or two

  * Review and decide what to try next

This isn’t about trying to get every test right. Most won’t move the needle.
But if you're running experiments tied to clear bottlenecks, you’ll learn
something useful every time.

Take Sonic Jobs — a job marketplace with high signup rates but low activation.
Their welcome email was too broad. After interviews showed that users looked
for specific job types, the team updated the email to include role-specific
links like “Amazon driver” and “Warehouse operative.” The result? Activation
doubled.

Sometimes you run a bunch of tests and nothing seems to work. That’s when you
zoom out and revisit customer outcomes.

Instead of focusing on why people didn’t convert, focus on why your best
customers _did_. What did they want? What did your product help them
accomplish?

If you offer a single clear outcome, you can lean into it. If your product
solves multiple problems, use onboarding questions to help customers self-
select — just like Calm does. That makes it easier to tailor your messaging,
onboarding, and growth strategy to their specific goal.

Eventually, you’ll spot the segment with the most urgent need and the highest
willingness to pay. That’s where you double down.

Founders often overlook great ideas because they feel too obvious or too
difficult. But many of the best growth levers aren’t new — they’re just right
for your business.

Lerner gives the example of Fatmap, a mapping app with slow-loading content.
The team dismissed SEO as a channel because the maps took too long to load.
Lerner proposed a workaround: use static images while the map loads in the
background. That one shift increased traffic and later contributed to
acquisition.

Another trap is “mental resistance” — where you avoid a test because it feels
too simple to be meaningful. But if the test aligns with your bottleneck, it’s
worth running.

Even if you’re the one leading growth, you don’t have to do it alone. In fact,
your entire team should be plugged into growth.

Start by sharing your North Star Metric across the company. Then ask each team
member how their work impacts that metric — and what they could do to improve
it. Bake that into their goals.

Lerner also encourages founders to make experiments public. Post them in
Slack. Let the team vote on variants. Show that everyone is learning together
— especially when things don’t work. That transparency builds confidence and
momentum.

The key shift here is cultural: growth isn’t something the “marketing team”
does. It’s something the whole company thinks about.

Eventually, you’ll hit a point where you’re doing so many experiments that you
need help. That’s when it makes sense to build a growth team — not before.

You don’t need a senior exec. Lerner recommends starting with:

  * A junior generalist who’s analytical, action-oriented, and curious

  * Or someone already on the team who’s shown interest in experiments — like an analyst, product manager, or even support lead

The important thing is: hire once you know your levers, and you just need
someone to scale what you’ve already figured out.

You wouldn't outsource your product before building version one. Don’t
outsource growth before you’ve figured out how your product grows.

Founder-led growth forces you to talk to customers, isolate bottlenecks, and
test ideas that get results. It gives you insights into your product, your
users, and your positioning that no outside hire can match — and once you’ve
built that understanding, you can bring in others to scale it.

This isn’t a detour from building your company. It _is_ building your company.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

I’ve seen countless first-time founders confused about startup valuation. So I
am covering few question that I received multiple times here:

**What determines a company’s valuation?**

In its most basic sense, valuation can be calculated by multiplying the
outstanding shares by the price per share. The thing is that company valuation
is more of an art than a science due to the mix of qualitative and
quantitative factors that go into it.

Value of company = Shares outstanding * Price per Share

Below, I share some of the factors that Brad Feld mentions in Venture Deals,
followed by my opinion on each:

  1. Stage of the company:

Early-stage valuation is impacted by factors such as entrepreneur experience,
the perception of overall opportunity, and the amount being raised.

Later-stage valuation heavily relies on financial performance and projections.

  2. Funding competition: there is a positive correlation between the number of investors who want to fund a company and the valuation of such a company.

  3. Leadership team experience: because there’s a perceived negative correlation between more experienced entrepreneurs and risk, the valuations of companies with more experienced leadership teams will be higher. Note: personal biases will play a role here.

  4. Size and trendiness of the market: Your market size (e.g., TAM, SAM, SOM) and the growing demand of a company’s market will also have a positive correlation with valuation.

  5. An investor’s entry point: Some investors have a valuation investment range. For example, an investor might only invest in companies that are valued at $10M or less.

  6. Financials and other numbers: There is a direct correlation between how well a company’s financials and numbers stack up (against its given industry and competitor benchmarks) with the company’s valuation.

  7. Economic climate: There is a tentative positive correlation between the stock market’s performance and the valuation of a company. That’s to say that if the stock market is performing well, valuations will be higher and vice versa.

If many investors perceive a given company to be less of a risk and more of an
investment opportunity (aka shows signs of a successful exit) — due to its
strong leadership, market size/trendiness, and numbers — the valuation of a
company is likely to be higher than lower. It makes sense, no?

Remember, investors want to invest in the horse that’s most likely to win the
race.

**What are some methods that investors use to value companies?**

Investors may calculate valuation by assessing:

  * Comparables: the valuation of other companies with a similar profile

  * Multipliers: industry revenue/EBITDA/EBIT multipliers

  * Formulas, such as pre-money valuation = ($1M x #Engineers) — ($1M x #MBAs) AND Net Present Value (discounted cash flows)

  * Venture Capital/Leveraged Buyout Method

  * Monte Carlo Simulations

You will find more info about all these and another method later.

The most common question that I received from every founder,

**Is it mandatory to calculate a company’s value to fundraise?**

Valuation in fundraising has several benefits. At a basic level, founders will
know exactly how much of the company they’ve sold and they’ll also have a
cleaner cap table. Valuation will also make life easier for everyone involved
— investors and founders.

That said, companies don’t need to value their companies in order to
fundraise, at the start. There are multiple fundraising vehicles that allow
for a postponed valuation to take place in a future and larger fundraising.
Such mentioned vehicles include, but are not limited to, the:

Convertible Note — Investors give companies money in exchange for an
opportunity to buy the stock at a discount in a future financing round. Until
then, the “investment” is considered debt that pays interest. If you want to
know more about it, check out our previous article.

SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) by Y Combinator. A SAFE is neither
debt nor equity and has no maturity date or accruing interest. You can also
check about this in our home page.

**Should companies aim for the highest valuation they should get?**

No. Because a too-good-to-be-true kind of deal is likely to hurt everyone
involved in the next round. If you have a high valuation in one round, then
fail to hit the right milestones and end up having to raise at a lower
valuation, that’s going to dilute your original shareholders. If that happens,
it’s possible that they will block a new financing. No founder wants that —
it’s already hard to run a company and fundraise.

Also, if a company raises at higher valuations, the company’s investors will
expect a bigger exit and will block a sale if they are not happy with the
selling price.

I hope this helps you to get an idea of what’s an important thing to know
during valuing your company.

You might still have questions like:

  * How should I talk about valuation numbers when investors ask?

  * What are the different valuation methods commonly used in the VC world?

  * What do VCs expect from founders regarding valuation?

  * Which method should I use to come up with a valuation number?

  * How can I used Excel sheet to come up with a valuation number?

  * Is there any framework I can follow?

We’ve covered all of these questions — along with templates and Excel sheets —
in our All-in-One**[Startup Valuation
Guide](https://theventurecrew.gumroad.com/l/valuationguide)**. You can
**[access it here](https://theventurecrew.gumroad.com/l/valuationguide).**

**[Patrick Campbell](https://x.com/Patticus)** sold his startup, Profitwell,
for $200 million last year — and it was entirely bootstrapped.

Since then he’s started sharing a lot of primary research he’s commissioned
into topics that there isn’t a lot of ground truth data on. Most recently, he
shared his **[competitive research
playbook](https://patticus.com/2023/12/16/competitive-research-playbook/)**
and shared this framework — the market command matrix:

The y-axis represents how much of a competitor’s resources they’re piling into
your market, and the x-axis represents how aware customers in your market are
of the competitor.

The big text in each quadrant is what you should do in response. While the
placements on the matrix aren’t exact (for example a “big VC bet” could have
dramatically more or less mindshare depending on what stage they’re in),
Patrick’s recommendations are good.

Note that he only recommends you take action against the two quadrants on the
right — the competitors who your target and/or existing customers are likely
to be aware of.

Another note: “all-out attack” may mean exploring partnerships when you both
have leverage in different parts of the market — it doesn’t mean burning all
your money on paid ads.

He also includes free playbooks on how to handle competitors in each quadrant
— the **[full article](https://patticus.com/2023/12/16/competitive-research-
playbook/)** is worth a read.

Starting a business with co-founders is like embarking on a long road trip
together. While the journey can be more enjoyable with partners who complement
your skills, even the strongest relationships need ground rules. This is where
a founder agreement comes in.

Simply put, a founders agreement is a legal contract between company founders
that sets clear guidelines for their business relationship. Think of it as a
roadmap that outlines everyone's rights, roles, responsibilities, and
expectations from day one.

**Why You Need One**

While not legally required, having a founder agreement is crucial because it:

  * Prevents misunderstandings by getting everyone on the same page

  * Provides a clear structure for handling disputes

  * Shows potential investors you're serious and well-organized

  * Protects both your business and personal relationships

As [Simon Bacher, CEO of Ling](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonbacher/), puts
it: "My wife and I co-founded our startup, and we saw a founders agreement as
essential - think of it like a prenup for your business."

**1\. Basic Company Information**

**2\. Roles and Responsibilities**

  * Each founder's specific duties and areas of authority

  * Clear job titles and their limitations

  * Flexibility for role changes as the company grows

**3\. Decision-Making Powers**

**4\. Equity and Vesting**

  * Each founder's ownership percentage

  * Vesting schedule (typically four years with a one-year cliff)

  * Conditions for receiving full rights to shares

  * Compensation plans

**5\. Commitments and Resources**

  * Expected time commitment from each founder

  * Initial capital contributions

  * Intellectual property rights

  * Other resources (industry connections, expertise)

**6\. Exit Planning**

  * Conditions for dissolving the company

  * What happens during an IPO

  * Handling of unvested shares

  * Non-compete and non-solicitation terms

Now that you know what goes into this document, here are a few founder’s
agreement templates and examples to help you craft your own.

  * [University of Pennsylvania Law](https://www.law.upenn.edu/clinic/entrepreneurship/startupkit/founders-agreement.pdf): Includes provisions about ownership structure, transfer of ownership, decision-making and dispute resolutions, representations and warranties, and choice of law

  * [Harvard Business School](https://startupguide.hbs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Founders-Agreement-Template.docx): Includes provisions on ownership, competition restriction, and exit situations

You’re going to go through many ups and downs with your partners. Creating a
founders agreement is an excellent way to ensure you’re all protected
throughout your business journey.
