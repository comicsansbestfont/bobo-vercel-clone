##### **START WITH**

Google Cloud’s 2025 [DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment)
report](https://blog.google/technology/developers/dora-report-2025/) just
dropped, and it’s the clearest evidence yet that AI has fundamentally changed
the way software is built. Nearly 5,000 technology professionals across the
world were surveyed, and the findings show massive adoption — but also some
surprising paradoxes.

Here’s what you need to know:

**1\. AI adoption is now mainstream**

  * 90% of software professionals (developers, PMs, engineers) now use AI in their workflows — up 14% from last year.

  * Median usage: 2 hours a day spent with AI tools.

  * 65% report heavy reliance on AI, with 20% saying they rely on it “a lot” and 8% “a great deal.”

Translation: AI is no longer a sidekick — it’s part of the daily toolkit for
nearly every developer.

**2\. The clear benefits**

  * Productivity: 80%+ say AI boosted how much they can ship.

  * Code quality: 59% report better-quality code as a direct result of AI use.

  * Throughput: Teams adopting AI are releasing more software and applications — reversing last year’s mixed results.

In short, AI isn’t just helping individuals; it’s starting to improve
organizational velocity too.

**3\. The “trust paradox”**

Even though AI is widely adopted, trust lags behind:

This paradox shows up in practice: developers use AI heavily because it’s
useful, but they don’t fully rely on it for final decisions. AI is a
productivity enhancer, not a replacement for human judgment.

**4\. AI as “mirror and multiplier”**

The report introduces a critical idea: AI reflects the state of your team.

  * In cohesive teams, AI amplifies efficiency.

  * In fragmented teams, AI highlights weaknesses — faster delivery, but also faster exposure of flaws.

This is why some orgs see AI as transformative, while others see only chaos.

**5\. The seven developer archetypes**

DORA moved beyond simple metrics this year and mapped seven team archetypes,
from “Harmonious high-achievers” to “Legacy bottlenecks.” These profiles show
how AI interacts with team culture and workflows. Big insight: organizational
health determines AI ROI.

**6\. The blueprint: DORA AI Capabilities Model**

Adoption alone isn’t enough. The report lays out seven essential capabilities
that drive meaningful AI impact: a blend of technical practices (like CI/CD,
data integration, and testing) and cultural factors (like feedback loops,
psychological safety, and cross-functional collaboration).

Put simply: AI won’t fix broken systems. To get the promised productivity
boost, orgs must evolve both their tools and culture.

Aventis Advisors [released](https://aventis-advisors.com/wp-
content/uploads/2025/09/SaaS-Valuation-Multiples-2015-Q3-2025.pdf) a new
analysis of SaaS valuation trends across public markets and private M&A from
2015 to 2025.

  * Growth slowdown: Median revenue growth hit 31% during COVID but has since dropped to 12.8% in Q2 2025, putting downward pressure on valuations.

  * Profitability push: Median EBITDA margins reached 7.5% in 2025, with investors rewarding efficient, cash-generating SaaS companies.

  * Rule of 40: Median score fell to 23%, but each 10-point improvement can add about 1.5× to revenue multiples, making it a critical benchmark.

  * Private M&A: More stable than public markets, with a long-term median around 4.7× EV/Revenue. Multiples dipped to 2.9× in 2024, but rebounded to 5.7× in 2025, mostly on larger $50M+ transactions.

  * Valuation drivers: Scale, durable growth, and defensible AI integrations are commanding premiums, while smaller SaaS firms with high burn face tougher scrutiny and tighter deal terms.

The SaaS boom-and-bust cycle has reset expectations. Going forward,
efficiency, scale, and AI defensibility—not just top-line growth—will define
premium valuations.

##### **SOMETHING MORE**

Micro-SaaS = a focused SaaS product with pointy features for a very specific
customer. Pat [studied
dozens](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18sH0AV_s0vR_kbFGhWLCkgua6xcMwqCM9qU1UmjZbN4/edit?tab=t.0)
of case studies and found common patterns behind the winners:

  1. **Ride trends or shifts**

     * Growing trend → e.g. waitlist software (ReferralHero, $18K MRR).

     * Missed opportunity → Amazon FBA tools (Gorilla ROI, $40K MRR).

     * Change in the world → rise of personal brands → Tweet Hunter ($220K MRR & acquired).

  2. **Build on large platforms**

     * Shopify (2M merchants), Amazon FBA (1.5M sellers), Twitter (100M+ businesses).

     * Example: WideBundle, a Shopify plugin for product bundling, $55K MRR.

  3. **Pointy solutions**

     * Do one thing extremely well → not an all-in-one.

     * Example: Testimonial → embed video testimonials, $83K MRR.

  4. **Serve a narrow customer base**

     * CyberLeads: only digital agencies targeting VC-backed startups ($40K MRR).

     * Gorilla ROI: not all FBA sellers, only spreadsheet/data-heavy ones.

  5. **Solve painful business problems**

$1M micro-SaaS ideas aren’t random — they win because they’re simple, built on
big platforms, serve specific customers, and solve money/time problems. Start
small, ship fast, and let the pointy feature lead you to growth.

Most founders overthink launches. They keep tinkering, waiting for “perfect,”
and end up stuck in stealth. Claire Butler, Figma’s first marketer,
[says](https://review.firstround.com/how-to-launch-your-startup-out-of-
stealth/) the opposite is true: momentum beats perfection.

Here’s her framework for stepping out of stealth without stalling:

**1\. Set a date, even if it feels early**

  * Don’t wait for every feature to be done—just reach “critical mass.”

  * Figma launched without multiplayer (its core feature) to avoid stagnation.

  * Rule of thumb: if you’re not slightly embarrassed, you’ve waited too long.

**2\. Create three forcing-function artifacts**

  * **Website** : One homepage + about/careers. Define tone, positioning, CTA. (Waitlist vs sign-up vs talk to sales?)

  * **Announcement post** : Founder-written narrative → why you built it, why now, where it’s headed.

  * **Social post** : Distill it all into a single screenshot, video, or punchy tagline. If it feels fluffy, rewrite until it’s authentic.

**3\. Pick launch channels wisely**

  * Focus where your ICP already hangs out (Reddit, Discord, LinkedIn, Twitter/X).

  * Use founder accounts to amplify first—brand handles start from zero.

  * Press is optional. Unless tied to funding, don’t waste time chasing exclusives.

**4\. Seed amplification before launch**

  * Build a list: friends, beta users, influencers, your network.

  * Tell them when launch is, what you’ll need, and share links day-of.

  * Momentum spreads outward from your circle—plan it, don’t wing it.

**5\. Remember: launch ≠ finish line**

  * Monitor replies, engage, and bookmark supporters for ongoing community building.

  * Don’t obsess over metrics too soon—track impressions, traffic, sign-ups, but focus on vibes + momentum.

  * A flashy launch ≠ product-market fit. The real game starts after.

A launch is a forcing function, not a final exam. Prep your date, artefacts,
channels, and amplification. Then get out there; momentum matters more than
perfection.

Most founders talk about growth. Few can clearly show how each new customer
makes or loses them money. That’s why running a unit economics model early
matters; it tells you if your business will compound or collapse.

Here’s how to use the sheet I’ve shared:

1\. Map your revenues

  * Enter your average revenue per unit (subscription, fee, or transaction).

  * Decide if it’s recurring (monthly/annual) or one-time.

  * Pro tip: if you don’t know exact numbers yet, start with estimates and refine over time.

2\. Add cost of sales (COGS)

  * Enter costs as a % of revenue (hosting, delivery, support).

  * The sheet calculates your gross margin per unit automatically.

3\. Plug in churn + growth assumptions

  * Set billing cycle (monthly = 1, annual = 12).

  * Add churn % (customers who drop each cycle).

  * Add expected annual margin growth (e.g., 5%).

  * The model uses these to estimate the average customer lifetime.

4\. Add acquisition + retention costs

5\. Review key outputs

  * LTV (Lifetime Value): how much a customer is worth over their lifecycle.

  * LTV/CAC ratio: >3 is usually healthy.

  * CAC payback period: months it takes to earn back the acquisition spend.

  * Cumulative cash flows: show when you turn profitable per customer.

6\. Stress-test scenarios

Why this matters

  * Investors use this as a quick sanity check.

  * It forces you to confront pricing, churn, and acquisition head-on.

  * A business with shaky unit economics will break no matter how good the growth story sounds.

plug in your numbers, and run 3 scenarios: best case, expected case, worst
case. You’ll instantly see whether your idea scales or needs fixing.

Recently, Brett Adcock, the founder of Figure Robot, shared a tweet in which
he listed several reasons **why he believes cold emails work better than
referrals.**

  1. Outbound cold email scales several orders of magnitude better than referrals - you can find 99.9% of anybody’s email.

Raising capital is a shots-on-goal game; you want to maximize top-of-funnel
pitches. Optimizing your fundraising for referrals will put you at a local
maximum.

  2. It’s a challenge finding somebody who will stick their neck out to refer you. People rarely want to use their political capital referring you to a *highly important person* in their network, therefore at best you’re left with lousy double opt-in email.

Although I completely agree with these points, many founders struggle with
writing cold emails to investors. Some founders even question whether
investors open cold emails. Here’s what investors said:

  * [Keith Rabois ](https://x.com/rabois)prefers a deck, and he reads most of them.

  * [Aileen Lee](https://x.com/aileenlee) or her partners read every email pitch that comes into Cowboy Ventures.

  * [David Sacks ](https://x.com/DavidSacks)of Craft prefers a short email pitch that summarises the opportunity.

  * [Satya Patel](https://x.com/satyap) of Homebrew reads everything sent to him

Jason (Founder of SaaStrfund) said - “I do get behind on email, but I love an
amazing cold email and have funded maybe ~50% of my investments from them. I
like an email pitch that is so amazing that I’d fund it just based on the
email alone. “

So yes, is a perfect warm intro better? Yes. But even the top, most famous
Seed VCs are hunting. Hunting unicorns and decacorns. And they can’t wait for
them all to come from their networks.

Here’s the email from two startups to which [Jason](https://x.com/jasonlk)
gave a million-dollar funding…

Email 1:

Email 2:

So put together the very, very best cold email you can. Make it awesome in
every way. And send it to your top VCs. At least seed and probably Series A
VCs, too.

They may not respond. But if it’s awesome, including the title, I bet they
open it. And if it’s super awesome, you have a better chance than you might
think of getting a meeting.
