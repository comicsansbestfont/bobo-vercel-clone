##### **START WITH**

Many founders assume adding AI coding assistants (like Cursor, Copilot, Claude
Code) will 10x developer output. The reality is more complicated.

Here’s what [research and real teams
](https://www.cerbos.dev/blog/productivity-paradox-of-ai-coding-assistants)are
finding:

  1. **Speed vs. perception**

     * METR’s July 2025 trial: developers with AI were actually 19% slower on OSS tasks, but they felt 20% faster.

     * The dopamine loop of instant code makes it feel productive, even when review/debug cycles erase the gains.

  2. **The quality trap**

     * 66% of devs in the 2025 Stack Overflow survey said AI outputs are “almost right but not quite.”

     * More context = more irrelevant noise. Senior engineers often spend more time fixing AI code than writing it from scratch.

  3. **Security & compliance risks**

  * Apiiro’s 2024 study: AI-generated code had 322% more privilege escalation paths and 153% more design flaws.

  * Secrets exposure rose 40%, often due to hard-coded credentials. For SOC2/GDPR/HIPAA companies, this is a real compliance red flag.

  4. **The 70% problem**

  * AI gets you to a demo fast (70%), but the last 30%—edge cases, tests, production readiness—is still human-intensive.

  * For juniors, AI scaffolding feels magical. For seniors, it often slows them down.

  4. **Business vs. dev reality**

  * Leaders love the “10x” pitch, but real bottlenecks are design reviews, QA, system dependencies—not typing speed.

  * Expect incremental wins in boilerplate and onboarding, not exponential leaps.

**Why this matters for founders**

  * Don’t over-index on AI as a productivity silver bullet.

  * Use AI assistants for prototypes, docs lookup, or junior onboarding.

  * For core product and security-sensitive code, invest in solid engineering practices first.

AI coding assistants are accelerators for demos and MVPs, but not replacements
for senior engineering or rigorous review. Treat them as scaffolding, not
shortcuts.

PitchBook’s latest [Emerging Tech Research shows
](https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/Q3_2025_AI_VC_Trends_Preview.pdf)how
concentrated AI venture funding has become. Out of 1,086 AI VC deals in Q3,
just four rounds xAI, Anthropic, Nscale, and Mistral, accounted for nearly
half of all capital deployed.

The money is still flowing. But it’s flowing to fewer companies, in bigger and
riskier checks.

**Here’s what’s happening under the hood:**

Investors see the LLM layer as the infrastructure on which every application
will be built, so they’re willing to deploy massive rounds into a handful of
contenders. That’s why Anthropic ($13B), xAI ($10B), and Mistral (€1.7B)
dominate quarter after quarter.

Nscale’s $1.1B raise shows investors are betting heavily on GPU clouds, data-
centre capacity, and compute infrastructure — not just the LLMs themselves.
This is where many believe the more consistent, less winner-take-all returns
will come from.

AI-specific chip startups pulled in $3.8B in Q3, vs. the usual ~$1.9B. The
scarcity of Nvidia GPUs, the rise of model-specific accelerators, and the push
for sovereign compute are driving this surge.

At the application layer, it’s still unclear who wins. At the LLM + infra
layer, the frontrunners are obvious, so capital consolidates around them. This
creates a paradox:

  * Hedge your bets by backing multiple model providers

  * But the infra + compute layer, where the value is more broadly distributed

What this means for founders**:** If you’re building an LLM or infra-layer
startup, investor appetite is still wide open, but competition is brutal, and
capital intensity is unprecedented.

If you’re building an application-layer startup, differentiation and
distribution matter more than ever, because funding gravity has shifted
upstream.

Q3 didn’t just show strong AI funding; it showed the _shape_ of AI funding.
And that shape is a pyramid with a very narrow top. The winners at the
foundation model and compute layers are pulling away, while everyone else
fights for what’s left.

PitchBook’s latest [global VC ecosystem
rankings](https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q4-2025-pitchbook-analyst-note-
global-vc-ecosystem-rankings) show an unmistakable reality: the US still
dominates venture capital, even as new regions push upward and geopolitical
forces reshape where innovation happens.

Here’s what’s happening across the global map:

Across both development (size, maturity, depth of capital) and growth (speed
of expansion), the US leads by a wide margin. No other region comes close to
the combination of deal volume, valuation strength, and startup density.

SF sits far above every other city in development scores, reaffirming its
global lead.  
But on growth, Nashville tops the world, and 14 of the top 20 fastest-growing
ecosystems are in North America. The US is expanding _from the top and the
bottom_ at the same time.

Despite ranking 19th overall, Saudi Arabia is now #1 in growth, ahead of
Switzerland, the UAE, and the other fast-advancing markets.

Eleven new countries entered the top-20 growth list this year, showing that
global participation is widening even though the US still dominates.

US AI funding in this period exceeded the next 20 countries combined. In
Europe, the UK, Germany, and France lead AI development—but their totals
remain far below the US.

**What this means for founders & investors: **The US is still the best-
positioned ecosystem for capital availability, valuations, and AI talent
density. But new growth pockets from the Gulf to emerging US cities are
creating fresh opportunities, especially for founders willing to build where
competition is lower and incentives are rising.

##### **SOMETHING MORE**

Most founders think naming is a quick brainstorm or a “let’s run it through
ChatGPT” exercise. [Arielle Jackson (From First Round) has
helped](https://review.firstround.com/how-to-pick-company-name/) hundreds of
startups name companies and products, and her view is simple: naming is
emotional, subjective and slow and still one of the most important early brand
decisions you make.

The biggest mistake founders make? They want the perfect name on day one, even
though the best names often become great over time (Disney, Nike, Square).
Your job is to pick a name that fits the strategy today and doesn’t limit you
tomorrow.

**Here’s the practical way to approach it.**

**Start with a placeholder**

Your incorporation name is not your final name. Most good companies don’t
start with the name they end up with. Some founders even intentionally pick
ridiculous incorporation names just to avoid attachment. It’s better to
incorporate as something unusable and rename once you’re clear about your
product.

When should you pick the real name?

  * When you’ve hit clarity on positioning

  * When you’re about to launch and need a public-facing brand

  * When your old name stops fitting your product

  * When legal risk forces a change

Founders who rush naming end up boxed in. Founders who delay it slightly make
far better choices.

**Start with positioning, not creativity**

Arielle’s process always begins with a simple question: Who is this for? What
space do we occupy? What makes us different?

A clear positioning statement makes naming dramatically easier because you
know what your name should signal: sophistication, speed, trust, creativity,
community, or something else entirely.

**Build a naming brief**

Before brainstorming, outline the constraints:

  * Who is the target user?

  * What tone and personality should the name convey?

  * Do you prefer descriptive, suggestive or abstract names?

  * Any languages, meanings or connotations to avoid?

  * Any domain or trademark constraints?

  * Five names you love, five you hate — and why

This reduces randomness and helps others understand your taste.

**How to namestorm**

This is where founders usually go wrong. They brainstorm alone. Arielle
suggests the opposite — widen the surface area. Bring in employees, friends,
even linguists. And use AI not to “name your startup” but to explore:

Keep the prompts specific. AI is better at generating raw material than
finished names.

**What themes to explore**

Use both direct and indirect angles:

  * Your core value (expertise → Maven)

  * Your product’s motion (gather, connect, accelerate)

  * Patterns, metaphors, symbols

  * Names from mythology or history

  * Simple phrases (PayPal, First Round)

A good brainstorm should produce hundreds of words, not ten.

**Narrow the list with structured criteria -** Evaluate your list against:

Distinctiveness, Memorability, Trademark risk, Domain feasibility, How it
sounds when spoken, How it looks visually, & Whether it will age well.

Then shrink to a shortlist of 10–25, then a top 3.

**Signs you’ve found a good name**

  * It’s polarising — some people love it, some hate it

  * It grows on you over a few days

  * It works on two levels (simple now, deeper meaning later)

  * It avoids the obvious, generic and forgettable

**Signs it’s a bad name**

**User feedback helps, but lightly**

Ask small groups of users what each name _communicates_ , not which one they
“like.” People tend to choose descriptive names because they’re familiar. You
want clarity, not consensus.

A simple memorability test works well: share three names today and see which
one people recall tomorrow.

**Legal + domain basics**

Arielle’s rule: Get the name right first. Then solve the domain. You can use:

  * prefixes (usemaven.com, tryfigma.com)

  * suffixes (squareup.com, awaytravel.com)

  * alternative TLDs (.ai, .co, .io)

  * lease-to-own domain deals

Trademark clearance should be done before spending money on identity work. A
quick USPTO search rules out obvious conflicts. A trademark lawyer helps
determine if you can register the name.

**Product naming vs company naming**

If you have one product, keep the same name as the company. Once you have
multiple products, use a simple structure like: Company + Descriptor

Example: Google Maps, Google Drive, Square Reader.

Use unique product names only when they help establish a separate identity
(Cash App, Android).

Naming is messy. It’s emotional. And it takes time. But with the right
framework, it becomes structured enough to produce a name that supports your
positioning, doesn’t box you in, is easy to remember and ages well.

If your AI product isn’t seeing adoption, the issue might not be the tech; it
might be how confident users feel using it.

Most teams building AI products obsess over model accuracy. They test
precision, tune parameters, and improve performance. But after watching dozens
of launches and failures, product leaders like [Assaf Elovic (Head of AI at
Monday) realised ](https://medium.com/@assafelovic/the-hidden-metric-that-
determines-ai-product-success-799a98fd57aa)something strange:

> Some AI products with mediocre models gain traction fast. Others with great
> accuracy completely flop.

So what’s going on?

The answer lies in a concept called **CAIR - Confidence in AI Results**. It’s
a simple but powerful idea: People don’t adopt what they don’t trust.

And trust isn’t just emotional, it’s designable, measurable, and improvable.
CAIR gives teams a framework for doing exactly that.

**What is CAIR?**

At its core, CAIR is a score that reflects how confident a user feels in the
AI’s output.

> The formula is: CAIR = Value ÷ (Risk × Correction Effort)

Here’s what each variable means:

  * **Value** : How helpful the AI is when it works.

  * **Risk** : What goes wrong if it makes a mistake?

  * **Correction** : How much effort does it take to fix a bad result?

> If an AI tool saves you time and is easy to undo if it fails, CAIR is high.
>
> If a mistake has big consequences and is hard to fix, CAIR drops fast.

This metric explains why even good AI gets ignored and how to fix that.

**Example: Why Cursor’s AI coding tool took off**

Cursor, the AI-powered code editor, became a favourite among developers. But
coding is risky; what if the AI writes buggy code?

Let’s break it down:

  * Risk: Low — the AI runs in a local editor, far from production.

  * Correction: Low — devs can delete or overwrite code instantly.

  * Value: High — saves hours on repetitive coding tasks.

**Result: High CAIR -** Developers trust it. They feel in control. They adopt
it.

Now, imagine Cursor’s auto-deployed code to production servers. The Risk jumps
to High, even if the Correction stays manageable.

**New CAIR = Much lower -** Adoption would likely suffer, even with the same
model accuracy.

**What about AI tools like Monday.com?**

Monday AI can automate workflows instantly. That’s powerful, but also risky.
What if it triggers the wrong action across a business-critical board?

  * Risk: Medium — real data, real impact.

  * Correction: Medium — complex to undo across systems.

  * Value: High — major time savings.

**CAIR: Moderate.**

Here’s the insight: Adding a preview screen could change everything. If users
see what the AI will do before it’s deployed, the **Risk** drops from Medium
to Low.

**Result: Higher CAIR → More adoption.**

This shows how product design, not just model tuning, can dramatically
increase AI success.

Some fields, like finance and healthcare, have built-in limitations:

Take tax software, for example.

But [TurboTax](https://turbotax.intuit.com/) uses a human-in-the-loop system.
The AI suggests optimisations. A human approves. Confidence rises.

Same with [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/) and healthcare
diagnostics: AI does pattern recognition, humans stay in charge of math and
decisions.

Designing around limitations beats waiting for perfect models. So, how to
improve CAIT ( Confidence in AI Results)

Here are 5 quick ways to boost your AI product’s CAIR, without changing the
model:

  * Strategic human-in-the-loop: Add human checks only at key decision points to prevent major errors without slowing things down.

  * Reversibility: Make every AI action easy to undo to reduce anxiety and build trust.

  * Consequence isolation: Let users test AI safely with drafts, previews, or sandboxes before going live.

  * Transparency: Explain why the AI decided so that users can trust, verify, and fix when needed.

  * Control gradients: Start with low-risk features and gradually offer more power as user confidence grows.

**Why this matters for product builders**

Here’s the mindset shift:

> Instead of asking, “Is the AI good enough?”, start asking, “Do users feel
> confident enough to use it?”

Because a well-designed, medium-accuracy AI can outperform a high-accuracy
system with poor UX.

Your product’s success doesn’t hinge on a 99% model. It hinges on:

And most importantly: How confident the user feels hitting that first button.

[Toby Egbuna](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/toby-egbuna_i-wasted-weeks-cold-

activity-7353042973724405760-Z3i7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADSZgeABxlwMnuq8n-_LND05e9NXan-
Jdvo) shared one of the best no-network fundraising tactics and ways to get
intros

Instead of cold emailing 300 VCs, he recommends this step-by-step process:

  * Shortlist 30 top funds you actually want

  * Use Crunchbase to find their 3 most recent portfolio founders

  * Connect with those founders on LinkedIn

  * Email and ask for a quick chat about their experience with the fund

  * If the call goes well, ask for a warm intro

Why it works:

> “You don’t need a huge network. You just need a system.”

Here’s the 14-step process Toby recommends:

  1. Build a list of 300+ VCs

  2. Prioritize the top 10% (30 funds) based on thesis, connections, brand, and fit

  3. Filter for just those 30

  4. Go to Crunchbase

  5. Search each fund

  6. Find the 3 most recent investments

  7. Note founder names, sites, and companies

  8. Repeat for all 30 funds

  9. Go to LinkedIn

  10. Send a connection request to every founder

  11. Open your email

  12. Email each founder asking about their experience (include a short, warm note)

  13. Do the calls, be genuinely curious

  14. If it goes well, ask for the intro

Many people wonder what top investors actually use AI tools for in their day-
to-day life, not just for making better investment decisions, but also for
staying productive.

Olivia Moore, an AI Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, tests dozens of products
every week, but only a handful make it into her daily AI stack.

Here’s what she relies on:

  * **Comet (Perplexity)** : Default AI browser for research, calendar/email triage, and automated outreach workflows.

  * **Julius AI** : A quick, accurate AI data analyst for spreadsheet insights and visualizations.

  * **Happenstance** : AI-powered people search across email, LinkedIn, and Twitter to map networks.

  * **Granola** : AI meeting notes with smart triggers for post-meeting workflows.

  * **Gamma** : AI slide decks, docs, and websites, with flexible formatting and sharing.

  * **Willow** : AI voice dictation tuned to personal writing style.

  * **Superhuman** : AI-enhanced email with Ask AI, Instant Reply, and Auto Reminders.

  * **Overlap** : AI video clipping and auto-captioning for long-form content.

  * **Krea** : AI creative partner for generating hyperrealistic visuals.

  * **ChatGPT** : For deep research, personal advice, and drafting.

She’s also experimenting with Serif (AI email assistant), Tako (trusted data +
graphics), and SnapCalorie (AI nutrition tracker).

Even at the center of AI investing, the tools that stick are the ones that fit
seamlessly into existing workflows and deliver daily value, not just novelty.
