##### **TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

As a first-time founder, you might find yourself in this situation - excited
about a positive response from a potential investor, but suddenly faced with
an unfamiliar term: 'data room.'

A data room is essentially a secure, organized collection of documents that
provides detailed information about your company. It's a tool for due
diligence, allowing potential investors to examine your business's financials,
operations, and potential in depth.

But before diving into how to build an investor data room, let me share an
important insight: Don't send all your data to investors too early in the
process.

Just because investors request data room access doesn't necessarily mean
you're making progress. Many founders make the mistake of sending all their
information at once (even before the first investor call) and end up getting
ghosted by VCs. The best way to avoid this is to create a two-stage data room
approach:

  1. A pre-term sheet data room

  2. A post-term sheet data room

This structured approach helps protect your sensitive information while
maintaining investor engagement throughout the fundraising process.

**Stage 1: Pre-Term Sheet**

At this point, investors typically have limited information about the company,
relying mainly on the pitch deck, website, and publicly available data. They
request access to a preliminary data room to perform a quick spot check and
gather material for internal discussions with their partners.

This Stage 1 data room helps investors validate their initial interest and
prepare for more in-depth conversations about the potential investment.

Here’s a list of the 5 sections and types of content you’ll want to include in
your stage 1 data room:

  1. **Business Summary / Company Overview**

  2. **Traction / Product Market Fit**

  3. **Financials**

  * Purpose: provide a financial overview of your business from the day you started to the present day with forward-facing projections. If you don’t have a financial model built, I highly recommend you check out Sturppy. Sturppy’s is used by 4,000+ startups and allows founders to build an investor-ready financial model without being an expert on finance or financial modelling.

  * Docs to include:

    * P&L / Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cashflow Statement, Financial Projections 1-3 years in the future

  4. **Team & Roles**

  5. **Cap Table**

After receiving and negotiating a term sheet, you enter Stage 2 of the data
room process.

**Stage 2: Post-Term Sheet**

This stage is crucial for streamlining due diligence before any final
agreements are signed. It's wise to create a separate, more detailed data room
for this phase, rather than just expanding your Stage 1 room. This approach
gives you better control and flexibility, especially when dealing with
multiple investors at different stages.

Here’s a list of additional sections and content you’ll want to include:

  1. **Entity Formation Documents**

  * Purpose: These documents are mostly needed by the legal team and are the set of documents used to certify your business’s good standings. These docs are going to fluctuate based on where your business is incorporated and the type of business entity you’ve chosen. If you’re a startup in the US, 9/10 if you’re raising venture, you’re going to be established as a Delaware C-Corp

  * Docs to include:

    * Shareholder certificate documents

    * Local/state/federal business licenses/letters of good standing

    * Articles of incorporation

    * Bylaws, Tax ID number, Operating agreement between founders, Shareholder meeting minutes/board minutes, Annual meeting notes/minutes

  2. **Customer & Partner Contracts**

  3. **Proof of Intellectual Property**

  * Purpose: If your company has IP and that was part of the pitch, you’re going to have to show proof of that IP. This includes patents, trademarks, copyrights, design

  * Docs to include:

  4. **Full cap table documents**

  5. **Tax Filings**

  * Purpose: Proof that your company is in good standing with the IRS

  * Docs to include: Tax History, Previous filings, Previous audit statements and any third-party financial evaluations

  6. **Information on Any Outstanding Litigation**

Just remember - unless you’ve received a term sheet and you’re asked to share
(and you will be asked if you’ve received a term sheet and decide to move
forward) don’t share (Stage 2 data room data) it until it’s requested.

Also, many founders ask about what solution to use to create and store all
this data. Let me address that:

If you're a founder on a budget, Google Drive works perfectly fine as your
data room. There's no need to spend money on fancy solutions. Some of you
might worry about privacy, security, analytics, and tracking - but honestly,
at your early stage, these aren't critical concerns.

Google Drive is secure enough, costs nothing, and most importantly - investors
are already familiar with it. Save your money for things that actually move
your business forward. That’s it.

##### **QUICK DIVES**

Recently a16z shared a detailed [article](https://a16z.com/big-ideas-in-
tech-2025/) asking AI founders to work on the following ideas for 2025. Here's
a comprehensive breakdown of the most promising opportunities:

The next frontier in AI infrastructure involves building massive "AI
Hypercenters" - think of data centres but dramatically larger, capable of
handling the intense computing needs of next-gen AI models.

However, there's also a parallel push toward smaller, more efficient AI models
that can run directly on our phones and devices. This dual approach aims to
make AI both more powerful and more accessible while maintaining privacy
through local processing.

A major shift is happening in how businesses operate. Taking inspiration from
Klarna, who boldly replaced Salesforce with their own AI system, more
companies are expected to overhaul their legacy systems with AI-native
solutions.

The vision is to have AI assistants for every white-collar role, automating
mundane tasks and augmenting decision-making capabilities. Particularly
interesting is the use of AI to simplify compliance and regulations in complex
industries like banking and healthcare.

Google's dominance in search is facing its first real challenge in years. New
AI-powered search tools are emerging that don't just provide links but deliver
precise answers and insights.

We're seeing specialized search engines for specific domains - legal research,
scientific papers, academic content - that provide deeper, more relevant
results than traditional search engines.

The consumer space is seeing exciting developments in creative tools with
real-time AI feedback. Imagine having an AI music collaborator that adapts to
your style in real-time, or video generation tools that can create content
specifically optimized for different platforms and purposes.

Personal AI assistants are becoming more sophisticated, learning from your
digital footprint to provide truly personalized support.

In healthcare, AI is opening new possibilities for treating common diseases
and making healthcare more accessible. The focus is on practical applications:
AI-powered diagnostics, remote monitoring systems, and solutions for
healthcare staffing challenges.

The goal is to make quality healthcare more accessible while reducing the
burden on healthcare workers.

The Path to Success For founders looking to build in this space, a16z
emphasizes that success won't just come from having cool technology. The
winning companies will be those that:

  1. Create solutions that are genuinely hard to replicate

  2. Design intuitive interfaces that make complex technology accessible

  3. Focus on solving real problems with a clear return on investment

  4. Build systems that can scale across multiple industries

This is an exciting time for founders who can identify genuine problems and
solve them with practical AI applications. The key isn't just to build
impressive technology, but to create solutions that deliver real value and can
build sustainable businesses.

While building MVP (Minimal Viable Product), Founders act like the “minimal”
part is the goal. Or worse, that every potential customer should want it. In
the real world, not every customer is going to get excited about your minimum
feature.  

The reality is that the MVP is

  * a tactic to reduce wasted engineering hours (code left on the floor).

  * to get the product in the hands of early visionary customers as soon as possible.

  * You’re selling the vision and delivering the minimum feature to visionaries, not everyone.

**Why A Minimal Viable Product (Minimum Feature Set)?**

The MVP is the inverse of what most sales and marketing groups ask of their
development teams. Usually, the cry is for more features, typically based on
“Here’s what I heard from the last customer I visited.”  

The premise is that a very small group of visionary customers will guide your
features until you find a profitable business. Rather than asking customers
explicitly about features X, Y or Z.  

One approach to defining the minimum features set is to ask “What is the
smallest or least complicated problem that the customer will pay us to solve?”  

This rigour of “no new features until you’ve exhausted the search for a
business model” counters a natural tendency of people who talk to customers –
you tend to collect a list of features that if added, will get one additional
customer to buy. Soon you have a ten-page feature list just to sell ten
customers.  

Most customers will not want a product with a minimal feature. The majority of
customers will hate it. So why do it? Because you are selling the first
version of your product to Earlyvangelists.  

Earlyvangelists = Early Adopter + Internal Evangelist

“Earlyvangelists are risk-taking customers who envision your startup's
potential to solve a critical problem for them, and have the budget to buy in
early.” Earlyvangelists can be identified by these characteristics (attached
image):

  * They have a problem.

  * They understand they have a problem.

  * They are actively searching for a solution and have a timetable for finding it.

  * The problem is painful enough that they have cobbled together an interim solution.

  * They have, or can quickly acquire, dollars to purchase the product to solve their problem.

Early evangelists buy into the vision before the product itself. They need to
fall in love with the idea. This vision will keep them committed through the
inevitable mistakes and challenges.

But early evangelists will stick with you through good and bad because they
share your vision.

According to the recent [Carta](https://carta.com/) report (Shared by Peter
Walker), it’s clear that - Startup employees don't care much about equity.

At least, that's what many of them are telling us about their exercise
decisions.

To become a real company stock, startup equity has to jump two hurdles. First,
it has to vest - meaning the employee has to remain at the company for a
specific amount of time.

Second, it has to be exercised, or purchased by the employee.  

The chart below shows the quarterly exercise rate for vested options since
2017 across US employees whose companies use the Carta. We split the exercise
rate into three separate lines to reflect the "status" of the option when it
expires.

  * 𝗜𝗻-𝗧𝗵𝗲-𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘆: options where the strike price at expiration is higher than when it was issued.

  * 𝗔𝘁-𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘆: options where the strike price at expiration and issuance was identical.

  * 𝗨𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘄𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗿: options where the strike price at expiration is below the strike at issuance.

Most stock options have a 10-year expiration window—but that gets cut short if
the employee leaves the company, either by choice or through layoff. So you
can think of this chart as showing "what per cent of employees exercise their
options when they leave".

In the pre-boom period, exercise rates hovered around 44% for in-the-money
options. Today that same figure has fallen to 33%.

Now this drop is probably to be expected. Startups have had a rough go over
the past few years with down rounds, layoffs, and curtailed fundraising.

But there are some signs things are changing. Super late-stage secondary
activity has picked up. The IPO forecasts for 2025 are getting brighter.
ServiceTitan just popped up on public day 1.

Equity in startups has this beautiful promise to it - but paying money now for
the chance of a windfall in the future is not an easy sell.
