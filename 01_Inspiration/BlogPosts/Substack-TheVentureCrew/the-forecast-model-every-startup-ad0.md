##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

Running a startup can feel like captaining a boat through a storm. You’re
blindfolded. The compass is broken. And you’re mostly guessing.

That’s where a financial forecast model comes in. First thing - it won’t tell
you the future. But it will help you see what’s coming, make smarter
decisions, and stretch your cash in the right direction.

If “building a financial model” sounds complex, overwhelming, or like
something you’ll “do later”... good news: is it doesn’t have to be. We’ve
created a straightforward forecast model template you can copy, customize, and
actually use.

Let’s walk through why every founder (yes, even early-stage) should have one
and what to focus on.

  1. **Cash is oxygen**

Forget “cash is king.” For startups, cash is air.

Without it, you’re done. A forecast model helps you project income and
expenses across time, so you’re not surprised when the runway gets tight.
Instead of reacting when you're gasping, you’re making moves ahead of time.

  2. **Speak the language of money**

Investors. Board members. Loan officers. Even vendors.

They all want to see that you’ve got a handle on your finances. A forecast
model helps you show not just say that you’re building with a plan. It proves
you’re not winging it, even if it feels like that some days.

  3. **Get better at saying no**

Startups are full of decisions that sound exciting: “Let’s ramp up ads!” or
“Let’s hire three more engineers!”

But can you afford to do that and still build the product? A forecast model
helps you understand tradeoffs, prioritize resources, and stay focused on the
metrics that matter.

  4. **Know what really moves the needle**

Whether your goal is acquisition, profitability, or that next funding round
your forecast helps you zoom out and see what truly impacts your outcomes.

For example: improving retention by just 5% might move revenue way more than
launching that new feature you’re debating.

Let’s break it down into five core sections you should focus on, especially in
the early stages:

  1. **Customer acquisition**

Think about how you attract new customers. Break it into clear channels like:

  * Performance marketing: Ads, paid campaigns, etc. (Track CAC!)

  * Sales team productivity: Deals won per rep.

  * Organic growth: SEO, word of mouth, referrals.

Start simple, don’t overcomplicate with 10 variables per channel. Use broad
assumptions, then refine with real data over time.

  2. **Customer retention**

Acquiring a customer means nothing if you can’t keep them. Your model should
reflect how long customers stay, and when they tend to churn.

Use cohort analysis or a basic monthly churn rate. Ask:

Retention is also your best indicator of product-market fit.

  3. **Revenue**

Revenue should be tied directly to customer activity:

  * For SaaS, it’s subscription price × active customers.

  * For marketplaces, it could be volume × take rate.

Start with average revenue per user (ARPU), and evolve into more granular
views as you scale.

  4. **Expenses**

Your biggest expense? People. Use a headcount plan to map out salaries, hiring
timelines, and team functions. Other key categories include:

  * COGS: Hosting, inventory, services delivered.

  * Marketing spend: Performance + brand.

  * Tools & software: Scale with team size and complexity.

  * Office, travel, services: Keep it lean unless proven otherwise.

Don’t default to “% of revenue” unless you have no better data. You control
your budget, make it intentional.

  5. **Cash flow + runway**

At the end of the day, it’s about how long your cash lasts. Forecasting your
runway (how many months you can operate before running out of money) helps
guide:

  * Fundraising timelines

  * Hiring plans

  * Growth investments

Always stress-test with multiple scenarios:

  * Best-case (aggressive growth)

  * Base-case (reasonable assumptions)

  * Worst-case (conservative path)

**Tips to get started (without burning out)**

  * Start simple. This isn’t a Wall Street IPO model. It’s your startup’s guiding tool.

  * Update monthly. Compare forecast vs. actuals. Adjust your assumptions.

  * Don’t aim for perfection. Aim for utility. It’s better to have a rough, usable model than a flawless one that sits unopened.

  * Think of it as a living document. Not a one-time exercise.

**Remember your forecast model = your strategy, in numbers**

You don’t build a model because investors ask. You build it to understand your
own business better. To make smarter decisions. To align your team. To spot
problems early and act on them.

“The real magic happens when you strike a balance between planning and doing.”

You can use this [financial model
template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hfxgjJQQCd-1J_WRkGoc64L-E5M5D6sM/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106576900328119216380&rtpof=true&sd=true)
to create one for your startup.

##### **HIGHLY RECOMMEND COHORT**

Most CEOs think scale means hiring more people. **[Christine
Carrillo](https://x.com/christinecarril) built three businesses to $200M+**
and did it with fewer humans by designing AI-first systems. At Joany, 5 out of
her 26 “employees” were AI agents. The result? 96% profit margins.

In this 3-week live course, Christine teaches the exact frameworks she used to
scale while working just ~20 hours/week.

You’ll learn how to delegate (to humans and AI), automate workflows before
hiring for them, and ruthlessly focus on the 10% that actually drives your
business forward.

[This cohort](https://maven.com/christine-carrillo/the-20-hour-ceo) is
designed for CEOs already operating at $500K+ revenue, ready to stop being the
machine and start building one.

Only a few days left to join the July 10–25 cohort. Don’t miss it.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Lovable is reportedly the fastest-growing startup in the world right now. Its
promise? Turn simple prompts into high-fidelity, interactive product
prototypes. Describe your app idea in a sentence or two, and Lovable builds a
functional UI around it no coding, no design tools.

It’s the kind of magical AI experience that spreads fast. But the more you dig
in, the more you notice something strange.

Subtle Software recently shared [an article
discussing](https://www.subtle.so/perverse-incentive-of-lovables-growth.html)
the same topic. Here are a few points and takeaways worth considering it’s a
valuable read for any founder building products.

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!JoJ8!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-
post-
media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F011da28a-f72a-482e-8621-5c216e592b93_1436x924.bin)Image
Source: UX Collectives

The product is good but not great. It gets close, but often makes small
mistakes. UI elements misalign, interactions don’t quite match, and it usually
takes a few extra prompts to get things looking right.

That’s where the real business model kicks in.

Lovable’s free tier gives you just five prompts per day. And you’ll probably
burn through them fast **not because you’re experimenting, but because the
tool doesn’t get it right on the first try**.

Which leads to an important insight that most people miss:

> There’s a perverse incentive: the less perfect the output, the more prompts
> you use, and the more likely you are to pay.

This doesn’t mean it’s intentional but it does raise questions. If the product
became too efficient, fewer people would hit the paywall. Slowing down the
path to revenue growth.

And yet, that friction combined with the delight of seeing your idea come to
life creates a powerful loop. People talk about it. Share it. Growth explodes.

**But is it sustainable?**

For many users, Lovable feels like a one-time thrill. You try it, show it off,
maybe even build a quick MVP. But then you hit limits:

  * It’s not always production-ready

  * You still need to clean up the UI

  * There’s no clear handoff into actual deployment

So retention becomes the big question.

A growing number of product people believe the real future of tools like
Lovable isn’t for indie builders it’s for agencies and product teams who want
to iterate faster, prototype collaboratively, and cut out weeks of back-and-
forth.

Imagine replacing a static slide deck with a live prototype. The team and the
client sit in the same room, making changes together. That’s a powerful
workflow shift and Lovable 2.0 is betting big on it.

Still, the competition is rising fast. Designers have mentioned tools like v0
as better alternatives. Dev-first platforms like Vercel may offer smoother
integrations. And larger players like GitHub or OpenAI could easily roll out
competing products with better polish and deeper ecosystems.

Here’s the takeaway:

  * **Text-to-app tools are magical, but still early.** They’re great for ideation, not yet great for production.

  * **Paywall design matters.** If users are paying because the tool makes mistakes, not because it delivers value that’s a long-term risk.

  * **The winners will be platforms, not demos.** The tools that become sticky will be the ones teams build into their actual workflow.

Lovable may be growing faster than any other startup—but that kind of growth
comes with a catch. If users don’t stick, or if competitors catch up, that
rocketship can stall just as fast.

The excitement is real. But so is the churn risk.

Every founder has felt it: that sting of watching a hype-fueled startup with
no product and no revenue raise millions, while your cash-flow-positive,
growing business struggles to even get a meeting.

It feels unfair. And it is.

But there’s a deeper logic behind it. One that has little to do with how
“good” your business is and everything to do with how venture capital works.

Recently, Steve Blank broke [down](https://steveblank.com/2025/07/01/why-
investors-dont-care-about-your-business/) why so many real businesses with
customers, revenue, and even profits often fail to attract VC attention. The
core idea? Venture capital isn’t built to fund good businesses. It’s built to
fund massive ones.

> Most founders misunderstand what investors are actually looking for. They
> assume that solid traction and profitability should be enough.

But venture capital follows a different playbook entirely.

Here’s what many founders miss:

  * **VCs are in the business of power-law outcomes.** They need 10x–100x returns to make [their math](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/155318590/steps-to-know-if-your-company-can-return-a-vc-fund) work. A steady-growing $20M company might be a great business but it’s not the billion-dollar rocket ship they’re hunting for.

  * **Your startup is a financial instrument.** The moment you raise venture money, your company becomes part of a portfolio. Investors aren't just betting on your growth they’re betting on a future exit (IPO, acquisition, or secondary sale) within 7-10 years.

  * **Perception drives value.** Especially now, when[ IPOs are rare and secondaries are a popular](https://www.cardumencapital.com/blog-posts/secondaries-reshaping-the-exit-landscape-for-vc-funds) liquidity path, what matters is how compelling your company looks to the next investor in line. The story you’re telling has to be big, bold, and believable.

This is also why certain sectors become hot overnight. Once a few top-tier
firms back AI companies, everyone wants in. The result?

  * Floods of capital chase a handful of “hot” categories

  * Even questionable ideas get funded if they have the right narrative

  * Meanwhile, proven but “unsexy” companies get ignored

> And secondaries have quietly changed the game. With fewer public exits, many
> investors are making money by selling their stakes to other funds. These
> aren’t new shares, they’re early investors cashing out while the company is
> still private.
>
> But this only works if the startup’s perceived value keeps rising so hype
> and optics matter more than ever.

So what can you do?

  * **Understand the game.** Your business may be amazing, but that doesn’t mean it’s venture-scalable. And that’s okay.

  * **Match your story to the investor.** Some funds chase trends. Others back overlooked gems. Know which one you’re pitching.

  * **Don’t assume they’ll “get it.”** You have to show them why your company can be massive and do it in a way that aligns with their timelines, incentives, and risk appetite.

Because once you take VC money, their model becomes your reality. If you don’t
fit what they’re looking for or don’t know how to frame your business in a way
that does you’ll keep hearing “no” for reasons that have nothing to do with
the actual quality of what you’re building.

And if you do have the kind of story they’re chasing? Now’s the time to go
big. Just remember: what they want isn’t a business. It’s a breakout.
