##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

Start with MVTs. Test your assumptions. Build when it matters.

We’ve all heard it before:

> “Build something small. Ship it fast. Get feedback. Iterate.”

But in reality, most MVPs aren’t minimal. They’re bloated. Overbuilt. Full of
features that don't matter. And worst of all, they don’t answer the most
important question:

Will people care?

That’s why Gagan Biyani, co-founder of Udemy, Sprig, and Maven, shared a new
concept that he called - The Minimum Viable Test (MVT).

Gagan’s seen it over and over, founders getting trapped in a fake loop of
progress:

  * You dream big, start building a small version of the vision.

  * You add onboarding, a dashboard, maybe even a sleek UI.

  * You ship it, only to realise… You still don’t know if anyone needs it.

And worse: now you’re stuck. Stuck with a half-working product, some early
users, maybe a few signups... But no clarity.

In the MVP world, you throw things at the wall and pray something sticks.  
In the MVT world, you move with deliberate testing and conviction.

An MVT is a focused experiment that tests a critical assumption your startup
needs to survive.

Gagan puts it like this:

> An MVP tries to simulate a full car.  
> An MVT just checks whether an electric engine works better than a gas one.

Here’s how to apply this as a founder:

  1. **Nail your value proposition**

Before testing anything, ask:

  * What are users already trying to do?

  * What problem are they frustrated by?

  * What clear, simple promise can you make to solve that?

Good example: “We’ll get a healthy meal to your door in 15 minutes.”

Bad example: “We’re a reimagined last-mile logistics platform optimised for
culinary efficiency.”

Keep it simple. Your value prop should feel like something your user would
actually say, not pitch deck jargon.

  2. **List your riskiest assumptions**

Every startup has hidden landmines. Your job is to dig them up early.

Ask yourself:

Five major risk categories:

  * Demand risk – Do people want this?

  * Execution risk – Can you deliver this well?

  * Monetisation risk – Will they pay enough?

  * Market size risk – Is this more than a niche?

  * Distribution risk – Can you reliably reach your customer?

Write them all down. Then circle the one that would ruin everything if it’s
wrong. That’s what you test.

**3\. Design your atomic test**

This is where most founders mess up. They try to validate everything at once
and learn nothing.

Instead:

  * Pick one hypothesis to test

  * Create a narrow experiment

  * Focus on one real action your customer must take

Don’t ask: “Would you pay for this?” Ask: “Here’s the payment link. Want to
try it now?”

Think of these tests like rough sketches, not product demos.

Even tests that “fail” can save you years of wasted time.

  * You build features nobody uses.

  * You attract a co-founder or team before knowing if you’re on to something.

  * You fall into the traction treadmill — chasing fake metrics from a half-working MVP instead of starting over with clarity.

> As Gagan says: You are nothing until customers want what you’ve built.

**Maven**

  * Ran 5 MVTs in 9 months.

  * Didn’t touch the code until the demand was proven.

  * Made $1M in revenue within 4 months of launch.

  * Skipped the MVP entirely and went straight to real company-building.

**Sprig**

  * Validated food ops with small MVTs.

  * Built MVP only after operations looked promising.

  * Hit $1M run-rate in first 6 months.

If you’re an early-stage founder thinking about building:

Ask yourself:

  * What assumptions are you making?

  * What’s the fastest, simplest behavioural test to validate them?

  * Are you building because users want it, or because you need to feel progress?

Then go run that test. Not a deck. Not a Notion doc. Not another brainstorming
session.

A real test. With real users. Right now.

So, the MVT isn’t a way to prevent failure. It’s how you fail smarter, faster,
and more informed.

You don’t need to code to learn. You don’t need a team to validate. You don’t
need traction to make progress.

You just need curiosity, a risky question, and the guts to test it.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Most founders think they know their ICP. Ask them who their ideal customer is,
and you’ll hear answers like “mid-sized companies that use cloud tools” or
“enterprises with large data teams.”

That might sound good on paper, but in reality, it's too broad to guide your
go-to-market motion.

As your company grows, a vague ICP becomes a silent killer, leading to high
CAC, wasted marketing spend, low conversion rates, and confusion across your
product and sales teams.

Especially in today’s fast-growing AI-native world, knowing exactly who your
product is built for is what separates high-growth companies from the rest.

Your ICP is more than a general persona. It’s a living blueprint of who your
product solves for best, and where you can win consistently.

A strong ICP should be clear, measurable, and deeply actionable across your
org. Ask yourself:

  * Can you define your ICP’s company size or revenue range?

  * Can you specify the industry, geography, and business model (e.g., B2B SaaS, ecommerce)?

  * Do you know the job titles and roles of the decision-makers involved?

  * Can you describe the specific pain points your product solves for them?

  * Do you know what tech stack they use and what buying behaviour they follow?

If you can’t answer these clearly, it’s time to revisit and refine.

Use this set of questions to either define your ICP from scratch or stress
test what you already have.

The key: don’t just answer these yourself, ask across the company. Sales, CS,
Product, and Marketing will all see the ICP differently, and your job is to
pull those insights together.

**1\. Which of your current customers gets the most out of your product?**

These are the people who buy fast, stay long, and tell others about you. Don’t
just look at the biggest accounts, focus on customers with:

Talk to them. Understand why they chose your product, what it helps them do,
and what they'd miss if it disappeared.

**2\. What traits do your best customers have in common?**

Look for patterns:

  * Company size, industry, and team structure

  * Geography and maturity (startup vs. legacy enterprise)

  * Tech stack (e.g., cloud data warehouse, GitHub)

  * Buying behaviour, are they early adopters or part of the traditional 70%?

The more specific you get, the easier it becomes to target the right prospects
and say no to the wrong ones.

**3\. What recurring objections do you hear from churned or lost customers?**

This question helps you identify whom not to sell to. Look for patterns in why
customers didn’t convert or churned early:

Not every loss means the ICP is off, but if you hear the same reasons again
and again, it probably is.

**4\. Which customers are easiest to upsell—and why?**

Upsellability is one of the strongest signals of true ICP fit. If a small team
adopts your product and it organically spreads across the org, that’s gold. It
means:

  * You're solving a meaningful problem across multiple departments

  * Your product’s value is clear without needing a heavy sales push

  * You're likely aligned with their existing workflows and compliance needs

False signals (like one-time big deals) can trick you. Focus on those who
expand naturally.

**5\. What do the customers of your closest competitors have in common?**

Sometimes your competitor’s ICP reveals opportunities or gaps:

  * Are they winning deals in industries you’ve ignored?

  * Are they closing customers you’ve lost?

  * Do they have features that help them unlock a market you’ve struggled with?

Study their customer base, then use RevOps data to see where your ICP
overlaps—or where you can carve out a unique lane.

> Your ICP is not static. As your product evolves, so should your
> understanding of who it’s for.

Say you’ve been targeting commercial teams for years, but you launch a new
feature, like supporting over 10,000 seats. That one capability might suddenly
make you a strong fit for the mid-market or enterprise segment.

This shift changes your ICP and requires corresponding shifts in:

Revisit your ICP every time your product meaningfully expands. Don’t wait
until the market tells you you’re out of sync.

A great ICP does more than help you close more deals. It gives your team
focus. It helps you say no to bad-fit customers. It shapes what you build, how
you sell, and where you invest.

Most importantly, it makes your growth more efficient.

Because no matter how good your marketing or sales team is, you can’t force
traction in a segment where the problem doesn’t exist, or where your solution
doesn’t stand out.

Get your ICP right, and you’ll see:

Clarity becomes your competitive edge. The tighter your definition, the easier
it becomes to win and keep winning in the right markets.

Everyone talks about solving customer problems, but not all problems are worth
solving, as some lack sales potential. Consider this: while some customers may
be indifferent to your solution, others are desperate for help. Understanding
this difference is crucial.

[Jeroen Coelen](https://substack.com/@iwantproductmarketfit) has shared 6 ways
people relate to problems, and only some of them lead to actual sales. Let me
break it down:

Level 1: Cannot experience

Level 2: Never Experienced

Level 3: Just Realising

  * Have the problem, but hadn't noticed it before

  * Good for testing your marketing message

  * Can become customers if your pitch works

Level 4: Gave Up Looking

  * Have the problem, but stopped trying to fix it

  * High sales potential if your solution is better

  * They're tired of bad solutions

Level 5: Actively Looking

Level 6: Just Found Solution

What to do based on who you find:

  * Finding Level 1-2: Wrong target market. Change who you're talking to.

  * Finding Level 3: Adjust your target market or wait for them to realise they need help

  * Finding Level 4-5: Perfect! Focus on selling.

  * Finding Level 6: You're too late. Find ways to reach people earlier.

Remember: Only Levels 3, 4, and 5 are likely to buy. Focus on them.

Also, many founders became discouraged and demotivated when they couldn't find
customers to try their product at an early stage. I highly recommend focusing
on customers who are at Levels 4-5, i.e. [people with hair on
fire](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/y-combinators-framework-for-
building).

Jeroen Coelen has shared two more articles where he discusses[ how to use this
model](https://iwantproductmarketfit.substack.com/p/why-the-chasm-model-sucks-
at-identifying) to identify launch customers for your beachhead market,
including [a case
study](https://iwantproductmarketfit.substack.com/p/customerproblemfit#details).
I highly recommend reading these articles.
