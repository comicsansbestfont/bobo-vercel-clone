One of the hardest concepts to internalize for those new to VC is what is
known as the “Babe Ruth effect”:

> [[pdf](http://turtletrader.com/pdfs/babe-ruth.pdf)]_

The Babe Ruth effect occurs in many categories of investing but is especially
pronounced in VC. As Peter Thiel
[observes](http://25iq.com/2014/07/13/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-from-peter-
thiel/):

> _Actual [venture capital] returns are incredibly skewed. The more a VC
> understands this skew pattern, the better the VC. Bad VCs tend to think the
> dashed line is flat, i.e. that all companies are created equal, and some
> just fail, spin wheels, or grow. In reality you get a power law
> distribution._

The Babe Ruth effect is hard to internalize because people are generally
predisposed to avoid losses. Behavioural economists have famously
[demonstrated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion) that people feel a
lot worse about losses of a given size than they feel good about gains of the
same size. Losing money feels bad, even if it is part of an investment
strategy that succeeds in aggregate.

People usually cite anecdotal cases when discussing this topic, because it's
difficult to access comprehensive VC performance data. [Horsley
Bridge](http://www.horsleybridge.com/), a highly respected investor (Limited
Partner) in many VC funds, was kind enough to share with me aggregated,
anonymous historical data on the distribution of investment returns across the
hundreds of VC funds they've invested in since 1985.

As expected, the returns are highly concentrated: about ~6% of investments
representing 4.5% of dollars invested generated ~60% of the total returns.
Let's dig into the data a little more to see what separates good VC funds from
bad VC funds.

_**Home runs:**_ As expected, successful funds have more "home run"
investments (defined as investments that return >10x):

(For all the charts shown, the X-axis is the performance of the VC funds:
great VC funds are on the right and bad funds are on the left.)

Great funds not only have more home runs, but they also have home runs of
greater magnitude. Here's a chart that looks at the average performance of the
"home run" (>10x) investments:

The home runs for good funds are around 20x, but the home runs for great funds
are almost 70. As Bill Gurley [says](http://25iq.com/2013/09/09/a-dozen-
things-ive-learned-from-bill-gurley-about-investing-and-business/): “Venture
capital is not even a home-run business. It’s a grand slam business."

_**Strikeouts:**_ The Y-axis on this chart is the percentage of investments
that lose money: This is the same chart with the Y-axis weighted by dollars
invested per investment:

As expected, lots of investments lose money. Venture capital is a risky
business.

Notice that the curves are U-shaped. It isn't surprising that the bad funds
lose money a lot, or that the good funds lose money less often than the bad
funds. What is interesting and perhaps surprising is that great funds lose
money more often than good funds do _._ The best VC funds truly do exemplify
the Babe Ruth effect: they swing hard, and either hit big or miss big. You
can't have grand slams without a lot of strikeouts.

**Join 5500+ Founders, VCs and startup Enthusiasts** Getting Tactical To
Build, Learn and Implement Startups, Technology and Venture Capital.

In recent times there has been a drastic shift in startups from focusing on
growth to making business profitable. But is this possible for every startup
to achieve profitability at an early stage without focusing on growth? In
search of this - I came across an article which talked about - When to
prioritize profit. When to prioritize growth. and examples of successful
companies in some of these categories. I have written a summary of that
article.

Due to changes in economic situation/funding winter, Investors have grown more
cautious, while founders are much more focused on burn and profitability
metrics even early on. The “growth first” mentality has given way to
profitability.

_Image: Profitability vs. Growth Image (Google Image)_

How should founders and VCs strategically decide when to blitz scale versus
when to focus on profitability? The right approach depends on factors like
market dynamics, access to capital, business model, and the stage of the
business. But as a founder, it’s important to understand where to focus at an
early stage because if you have this idea - you will work on the right
strategy.

**Under what circumstances does prioritizing profit make sense?**

  * **Demand slows down** — customer demand may change due to factors like economic conditions, industry headwinds, interest rates, etc. Slowing demand means that there’s less revenue growth potential, so it’s time to conserve runway

  * **Access to funding is uncertain** — When capital is scarce, investor sentiment shifts, or milestones for the next round look unattainable, focus on profitability can help extend the runway

  * **After core product validation** — after demonstrating product-market fit and customer traction, it’s time to refine the business model and path to profitability

  * **Low-margin business model** — for startups competing on price and high volume vs. high margin, tracking and improving unit economics is crucial from the early stages

  * **High customer acquisition costs** — when the costs of acquiring customers are too high relative to customer lifetime value, it signals a need to focus on improving unit economics before aggressive growth

  * **Lifestyle business goal** — for founders not focused on building unicorns or billion-dollar exits, profitability may take priority

**Some scenarios where focusing on rapid growth could be the wise strategic
choice:**

  * **Fast-growing market** — when the overall market is experiencing rapid adoption and growth, capitalize on the rising tide by fueling growth

  * **First mover advantage** — when it’s a disruptive innovation or new business model, grow to capture market share before competitors, especially if it’s a winner-take-all or winner-take-most market

  * **Abundant capital** — when funding is readily available and investors are prioritizing rapid growth, utilizing capital to expand aggressively rather than focusing on near-term profitability can align interests

  * **Before product-market fit** — when the product is still in development and product-market fit remains unproven, the focus should be on iterating, building, and finding traction

  * **Network effect** — for businesses that benefit from network effects such as marketplaces and social media platforms, unfavourable unit economics early on are typical and can be offset by focusing aggressively on growth. Focusing on growth to achieve scale can justify delaying profitability until the market is established

  * **Economies of scale** — for businesses like manufacturing and infrastructure with high fixed costs, growth is key even at a loss in order to reach economies of scale and drive down unit costs over time. The larger the scale, the higher the profitability

  * **Adjacencies and new products** — when new complementary products or markets significantly expand TAM, aggressively expanding to them before competition arises can be prudent

While rapid growth at the expense of profits can be strategically timed to
capitalize on opportunities, growth cannot be sustained forever without
eventual profitability. The key is evaluating whether the timing to reach
profitability should be immediate or longer-term depending on factors such as
those listed above.
