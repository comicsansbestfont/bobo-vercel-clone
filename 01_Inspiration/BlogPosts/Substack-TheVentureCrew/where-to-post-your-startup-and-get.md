##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

If you're building something new, one of the hardest (and most underestimated)
parts is getting your first users.

You’ve spent days, maybe weeks, writing code, designing the UI, and pushing
features live. But when it's time to share it with the world, you're stuck
wondering:  
Where do I even post this? Who’s going to care?

The truth is: distribution matters as much as the product, especially in the
early days. And you don’t need a growth team to get started. What you do need
is a list of places where early adopters, builders, and curious users hang out
and where sharing your startup can actually move the needle.

Here’s a practical breakdown of where to post your startup from launch
platforms to niche communities to software directories that can help you go
from invisible to discovered.

**Launch platforms:**

Great for buzz, validation, and early adopters who love trying new tools.

**Software directories:**

Think of these as long-term SEO and trust-building channels. Great for
credibility.

**Lifetime deals platforms & groups:**

Useful if you want early cash, rapid feedback, and distribution all at once.

**Subreddits (always check the rules before posting anything):**

Not for everyone, but if you post with context and care, it’s a goldmine. You
can even check out our guide on how to [use Reddit to onabrod customers

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

One of the most common refrains in the generative AI era is that “startups are
growing faster than ever”, and often doing so with fewer resources.

There are some jaw-dropping outliers:

  * Lovable reached $50M in revenue in just six months.

  * Cursor hit $100M in its first year.

  * Gamma made $50M with under $25M raised.

But these are the top 0.1% stories. For everyone else building in AI: what
does “working” actually look like?

Before the AI wave, benchmarks were simple. A great enterprise SaaS startup
achieved $1M ARR in its first year. Consumer startups? They often delayed
monetisation until they had millions of users relying on ad revenue or upsells
later.

Now? Things have changed. a16z shared detailed [benchmark
data](https://a16z.com/revenue-benchmarks-ai-apps/) from hundreds of AI
startups, and the new standards are clear:

Across the companies a16z reviewed, the bar has moved up.

  * The median AI enterprise startup now reaches $2.1M ARR in its first year.

  * The median consumer AI startup hits $4.2M ARR in the same time.

  * Top quartile consumer AI apps? $8.7M ARR in 12 months.

  * And both groups are raising Series A rounds in under 9 months from monetisation.

For founders, this means: just being “good” isn’t enough anymore. The old $1M
ARR mark is now the lower end of what VCs expect. Speed to revenue and speed
to iterate are your biggest leverage points.

And even if you’re not monetising yet, your shipping velocity and product
iteration pace need to signal that you’re building toward that trajectory
fast.

In AI, speed has become a moat.

Not only are metrics improving across the board, but the best startups are
pulling away even faster.

Top AI companies aren’t just peaking early. They’re sustaining and
accelerating growth after the first 12 months, unlike in the pre-AI era, where
growth often slowed after year one.

But it’s not all about revenue. Series A investors still look at usage and
retention metrics, even if it’s only 6 to 12 months of data. Later-stage
rounds will go deeper: high top-line growth won’t make up for weak engagement
or poor retention.

So while revenue speed gets you noticed, retention keeps you in the game.

It’s no longer just B2B that VCs see as “real.” Today’s AI-native consumer
startups are not only monetising earlier, they’re often doing so at higher
ARPUs than their pre-AI predecessors.

Why? Many B2C AI apps are training their models. When they launch a new
version, they see step-function revenue spikes. Usage and revenue surge with
each release, often plateauing until the next big product update.

Even if conversion to paid is lower, once users do pay, they stick. According
to a16z’s data:

  * Paid user retention between months 1 to month 6 is nearly identical to what was seen in top pre-AI prosumer apps.

  * That means these aren’t just AI tourists — they’re active, valuable users.

[Olivia Moore](https://x.com/omooretweets) notes that 90% of the top 50 AI
consumer apps are already monetising, despite lower conversion rates. And
they’re doing so with a higher ARPU than pre-AI models.

But there’s a catch:

Some AI startups are accidentally going viral in countries that are hard to
monetise, Brazil, China, and India. So even if user numbers look great, you
have to ask:

  * What % of users are converting?

  * Are they coming from high-intent, monetizable geographies?

  * What do free users cost you (especially with GPU-heavy AI products)?

A $0 CAC doesn’t help much if free users cost more to serve than they bring
in. Founders are now restricting access for unprofitable free users from low-
converting markets or channels.

So the bar has shifted, and founders need to think differently.

  * **Speed wins:** Whether it's revenue, iteration, or product launches, velocity gets you funded.

  * **Retention matters more than vanity metrics:** Strip out AI tourists. Focus on paid or engaged users.

  * **Consumer AI is a real business model:** With the right product and monetisation loop, B2C can outperform B2B.

  * **Not all traffic is created equal:** Direct and organic traffic means intent. Viral growth in low-converting regions can be misleading.

This isn’t just hype. The data from a16z, based on real metrics from hundreds
of companies, proves it: the best AI startups are growing faster, monetising
earlier, and holding onto users better than ever.

In this new era, “working” doesn’t just mean having a cool demo or hitting $1M
ARR. It means sustained speed, smart monetisation, and retention that scales.

“Figuring out” your startup’s TAM is somewhat useless. Most of the time, it’s
made up (TAM - Totally Made-Up Number) or at least very generous, and everyone
knows it. But the real sin about TAM is that it’s just one giant number.

Sure, you have SAM and SOM as well, but those aren’t much better. They don’t
tell you anything actionable, like, for example, how ready to buy your market
is.

[The Buyer’s Pyramid](https://www.fishhookmarketing.com/chet-holmes-buyers-
pyramid-explained/) is a framework that divides your potential market into
five categories based on how likely they are to buy your product or service.
Alert: only 3% of your audience is actively shopping for what you offer.

Here’s the breakdown:

  * **Buying Now (3%)**  
These are your hot the tiny sliver of people ready to purchase. They’re
already doing research, comparing options, and looking for the best deal. This
group is your low-hanging fruit, but also your most competitive audience.

Most businesses spend too much time chasing the top 3%, fighting over the same
small pool of customers. The Buyer’s Pyramid shows that 67% of your potential
market is in the middle layers, waiting to be educated, nurtured, and
persuaded.

What I like about the framework is that you can use different strategies for
each distinct user group, track performance with simple tagging when potential
customers are in your funnel, and audit whether you’re spending your time and
money most effectively with sales and marketing.

Your customers don’t care about your product. At all. This sounds harsh, but
it’s true. They have no vested interest in it.

They only care about what your product can do for them. Here’s an easy example
with Super Mario:

  * **Mario** → Your customer who needs help navigating their world.

  * **Your Product** → In a vacuum, this does nothing for Mario. It simply exists.

  * **Mario, Using Your Product** →**** Suddenly, Mario has new abilities and can conquer their problems.

The takeaway? Avoid selling and marketing based on what your product can do.

Focus entirely on the transformation and future state that your customers will
be in once they buy and use your product. It’s all about the benefits, not the
features. What can your product’s features do for your users?
