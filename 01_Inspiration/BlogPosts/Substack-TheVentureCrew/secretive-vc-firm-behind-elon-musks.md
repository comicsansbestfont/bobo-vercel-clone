##### **INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU**

[SkinBit
](http://wefunder.com/skinbit?utm_source=Venture_Curator&utm_campaign=Venture_Curator_Newsletter)is
building the first full-body AI skin scanner to deliver life-saving cancer
detection in just 60 seconds. With a $15B market and millions of Americans
left waiting for appointments, the need couldn’t be clearer.

Now, a proven team with over $1.5M already raised is bringing early detection
to everyone, starting with two flagship clinics in Beverly Hills and San
Francisco.

**Why investors are excited:**

  * Validated demand: 4 LOI signed, representing 55,000 patients, 3,000+ patients on waitlist

  * Proprietary 50,000-image dataset and Stanford dermatology backing

  * Projected $1M revenue per scanner/year with zero upfront clinic cost

  * FDA 510(k) filing in progress, with clinics launching in 2026

SkinBit combines hardware, AI, and clinical workflows into a single platform
to accelerate early detection of skin cancer.

##### **START WITH**

[Vy Capital ](https://www.vycapital.com/)might be the most unconventional and
effective investment firm in tech.

With a tiny team and almost zero public footprint, they’ve quietly become one
of Elon Musk’s biggest backers, funding SpaceX, xAI, Neuralink, and Twitter/X,
and producing results that most VCs only dream of.

Here’s how they operate and why they matter:

**Lean team, massive returns:** Vy runs with just 4 core investors and about
20 total staff, split between California, London, and Dubai. Despite this,
they’ve managed $15B AUM and posted an average 28% annual return over 10
years, doubling the S&P 500.

**All-in on Musk** : They’re not just passive investors. Vy backed SpaceX at a
$15B valuation (now ~$400B), put $700M into Twitter/X, and has large stakes in
Neuralink and xAI. Some estimates suggest over half of Vy’s portfolio is tied
to Musk-led ventures.

**Minimalist by design:** Their website is a single page. No media interviews.
No pitch decks. Just quiet, outsized results.

**Closed to outsiders now:** After compounding billions, Vy recently told its
LPs it won’t raise more outside capital. They’re now investing their own
money, a rare move in venture.

**Not just US bets:** Vy was also an early investor in Zomato and Urban
Company in India, as well as fintech company Upgrade, AI chipmaker Cerebras,
and cyber-insurance firm Coalition.

**What makes Vy different?** They operate more like a high-trust family office
than a traditional VC. Back the right people early. Keep the team small. Skip
the noise. And ride long-term conviction to outsized outcomes. ([Read

AI agent startups aren’t just raising billions; they’re turning into real
revenue engines.

A new [CB Insights report](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/ai-agent-
startups-top-20-revenue) reveals that 42% of the top players are already
commercialising or scaling. Some are pulling in $100M+ ARR just 2–3 years
after founding.

**What’s driving this growth?**

  * Workflow-focused agents win early: Startups targeting engineering, customer support, and internal enterprise workflows are scaling fastest. These use cases show immediate ROI and are easy for companies to adopt.

  * $13B+ in 2025: Enterprise AI agents & copilots are projected to grow from $5B (2024) to $13B ARR by the end of 2025, with companies like Cursor ($500M ARR), Mercor ($100M ARR), and Lovable ($100M ARR) leading the pack.

  * Insane efficiency: Cursor ($3.2M per employee) and Mercor ($4.5M per employee) are outpacing Microsoft and Meta in revenue per head. They’re operating at big tech levels, but with startup speed.

  * Valuation gaps show investor belief: Customer service AI agents are being valued at 127x revenue, far above the average 52x across the top 20. Why? Investors expect AI to rapidly replace support teams across the board.

  * Defensibility still unclear: The challenge ahead: Can these startups hold their position? As giants like Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI enter the space, moats will depend on: Proprietary data, Deep vertical focus, and switching costs via deep integrations

AI agents aren’t just the future; they’re already rewriting how fast software
companies can monetise.

We’ve seen AI help write code. But what about analysis?

Dan Hockenmaier shared [a write-up](https://www.danhock.co/p/vibe-analysis) on
Vibe Analysis — the moment when you stop running queries manually and start
“talking” to your data.

Instead of analysts bouncing between SQL, Excel, dashboards, and reports, the
future is a single AI-powered interface that understands your company’s data,
answers tough questions, and even creates charts, all in one go.

Here's the progression Dan outlines:

  * Today (Augmented Analyst): AI helps with cleaning, querying, and drafting faster. Think ~20% productivity gains.

  * Next (Accelerated Analyst): Full-stack tools emerge that compress analysis time by 5x and let anyone, not just analysts, get insights on their own.

  * Soon (Agentic Analyst): AI agents will handle end-to-end analysis with zero human help for simpler tasks.

  * Future (Autonomous Analyst): AI that proactively runs analysis, spots trends, and suggests decisions before you even ask.

Why this matters:

  * Analysts will be hired less for SQL skills and more for judgment, intuition, and the ability to ask good questions.

  * Tools like Looker and Mixpanel tried to “democratise” data before, but AI will finally make it real, even your CEO or sales rep could pull meaningful insights instantly.

  * This doesn’t eliminate analysts. It amplifies them. Like going from horse to motorbike.

A stat that says it all:

> Cursor ($500M ARR) and Mercor ($4.5M per employee) are already more capital-
> efficient than Microsoft or Meta.

The big takeaway? Vibe analysis is a new way of thinking with data. And it
might be the fastest lever for company growth over the next 5 years.

##### **SOMETHING MORE**

Most employees undervalue their ESOP because no one explains it well. Founders
often say things like “you’re getting x% of the company” or “this is worth
$40K”, but that sets false expectations and creates more confusion than
clarity.

Here’s how to fix it:

  * Start early: explain ESOP terms clearly during the offer and onboarding, exercise price, vesting schedule, and exit conditions

  * Don’t frame equity in dollar terms; instead, give a basic scenario model showing what outcomes might look like at different exit values

  * Run ESOP explainer sessions for the full team: what it is, why it exists, how it works

  * Use forecasting tools to show employees how equity compounds over time

  * Update regularly on valuation changes, exit planning, and how that affects the value of their shares

  * Share the actual plan rules, total shares, option pool size, cliff period, and what happens when they leave

The goal isn’t to hype up equity, it’s to make it understandable. When
employees get it, they start thinking like owners. ([Read full post
here](https://www.airtree.vc/open-source-vc/communicating-esop-value-to-
employees))

Also, you can check out the Airtree VC[ ESOP Value
calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y_HHt0iceK0fv350SKQsPPmxTWMjg5SJ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107905195340848653668&rtpof=true&sd=true):

Before you write a single line of code, ask: Can 1,000 people pay $100 for
this?

If the answer’s fuzzy, you’re not building a business, you’re prototyping a
hobby. This test cuts through the noise.

Here's how to pressure-test your idea:

  * **Define your buyer narrowly:** Not “busy professionals”, but “marketing managers at 50-person SaaS companies who make Friday reports manually and hate it”

  * **Clarify the result:** Not “save time”, but “get Friday afternoons back and look like a data genius to your CEO”

  * **Map your distribution:** Not “social media”, but “LinkedIn groups, SaaS Slack communities, and industry newsletters they read”

  * **Model the math:** Not “lots of traffic”, but “1,000 visitors × 15% opt-in × 20% booking × 30% close × $100 = $9,000/month”

This is how you avoid a 6-month build that leads to zero buyers.. You don’t
need branding, followers, or a website. You need clarity on buyers, value,
reach, and conversion math. ([Read full post

you-100-you-dont-activity-7340363344509325314-kp4c/))

It took 2–3 months and multiple tests to refine this. But now it’s a
repeatable, scalable framework for startup founders doing outbound.

Here’s the breakdown that worked:

  1. **Subject**

Keep it ultra-relevant and close to the customer’s world. Use a combo like
`Company Name + Service` to make it feel specific, not generic.

  2. **Opening**

Use a short personalised line that references what they do. You don’t need
deep research, find one shared pattern (like “saw your events page”) and
connect it to your service with a simple question.

  3. **Pain**

Call out a real frustration they likely deal with daily. The more vivid and
true it feels, the more they’ll read.

  4. **Solution**

Share who you are, what your tool solves, and a simple result (“grew
conversions by 10%”). If you’re the founder, mention it; people respond better
to founders than SDRs.

  5. **Question**

End with an easy A/B choice: “Want a one-pager or a quick 60s demo?” Avoid
generic yes/no.

One visual (like a product GIF) can boost replies too; use sparingly in small
batches. ([Read full post here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/oliver-

Michel Lieben shared a [detailed GTM
funnel](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michel-lieben_how-id-find-my-
first-10-b2b-clients-if-i-activity-7353008470603767808-X78a) he’d use if
starting from zero again, one that helped him grow to $5M+ ARR. Here's the
playbook broken down for founders looking to get their first clients without
spending big.

Start with visibility over budget

Go for low-cost, high-effort channels early on:

These helped him build brand visibility fast.

Turn visibility into conversion

Send traffic to a single clear destination, either your website or an
optimised LinkedIn profile.

  * Use a short video sales letter

  * Add a lead magnet for email capture

  * Use visitor ID tools to track anonymous traffic

Tools: Instantly, Vector, Midbound

Re-engage warm leads manually

He suggests writing the first 50 outbound messages by hand to sharpen your
offer and improve messaging.

  * Focus on quality before automating

  * Reach out via email, LinkedIn, or even WhatsApp

Tools: lemlist, Expandi, Woodpecker

Stick with it for at least 3 months

This approach isn’t complex, but it takes consistency. Stick to this loop of
visibility → landing → re-engagement, and you’ll eventually close your first
10 deals.

Forget clever one-liners—top AI startups now treat prompts like onboarding
docs. Think 6+ page instructions, role clarity, step-by-step flows, and
embedded tags. Why? Because that’s what makes LLMs reliable and agent-like.

Here’s what they’re doing differently:

Don’t just say “Answer this.” Instead: “You are a senior support manager
overseeing tool approvals.” A strong role sets the tone, reasoning style, and
response format.

LLMs fumble vague prompts. Give them an explicit plan: “Step 1: Review the
tool name. Step 2: Check policy match. Step 3: Approve or reject.”

Parahelp uses XML-style tags like `<manager_verify>accept</manager_verify>`.
Tags make outputs easy to parse and debug.

These startups feed their own prompts and outputs back into the LLM to ask:
“How can I improve this?” The LLM often gives better rewrites than humans.

Especially for complex tasks. Jazzberry gives examples of tough bug reports
and expected responses. Accuracy goes up.

Escape hatches are crucial. It’s better to admit uncertainty than to
hallucinate confidently. Helps with trust.

Ask the LLM to explain _why_ it made a decision. Combine that with prompt test
cases (evals) to stress test reliability. Many founders say evals are more
valuable than the prompt itself.

This structured prompting is how top teams move from “cool demo” to “reliable
agent.” Watch the full YC talk: [State-of-the-Art Prompting for AI
