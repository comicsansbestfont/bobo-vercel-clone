##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

The second most common reason VCs pass on a startup is some version of "the
market isn’t big enough."

For a VC to deliver strong returns across their fund, they usually need at
least one investment that turns into a multi-billion-dollar company. Because
of that, most VCs want to believe that _every_ company they invest in has the
potential to reach that kind of scale—even if they know it won't happen every
time.

The challenge is, that many of the most exciting startups _don’t_ look big
enough early on. They’re often going after markets that don’t exist yet, or
they’re tackling a niche that _seems_ small—but could actually be huge with
the right approach.

So, if you’re a founder on the VC path, how do you counter investors’ concerns
about market size?

I recently came across a post by [Rob Go](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robgo/)
(co-founder of NextView) from 2015 that's still incredibly relevant. He
outlined different approaches founders can use to frame their market
opportunity better—and I thought it was worth sharing a few keynotes and my
own thoughts on it.

Some of these approaches are more left-brain (logical and analytical), while
others are right-brain (emotional and intuitive).

Both types of thinking are important—and it’s good to remember that investors,
especially those making team decisions, often come at this question from
multiple angles.

Most market-size stories start top-down. “The marketing software space is
worth $X billion, so it’s clearly a huge opportunity.” That kind of framing
works especially well if you're going after a big, existing market. It's
simple, and most investors default to it.

But a more thoughtful way to present it is by starting top-down and then
adding detail—brick by brick. Show how the opportunity can actually be
_bigger_ than it looks. For example:

  * You can expand into new geographies

  * You have potential to upsell or introduce premium pricing

  * The overall market is growing

  * There are logical adjacent verticals or complementary products you can expand into

This approach won’t rescue a tiny market, but it’s a great way to help
investors see the upside if they already believe the core market is
meaningful.

Top-down logic breaks down fast when you're creating something new—especially
if the market doesn’t quite exist yet.

Here, the better move is a bottoms-up analysis. Start with the number of
potential users, make reasonable guesses about what they'll pay, what share of
them you could capture, and go from there.

But expect some pushback—on things like:

  * How you define and segment your users

  * Whether your market share assumptions are realistic

  * The fact that these are still educated guesses

You can address those concerns by showing data: how much money people already
spend to solve the problem today, or an ROI calculation that makes your
product a “no-brainer.”

Also remember: this kind of story works better if you're solving a real
pain—not offering a nice-to-have. Painkillers sell better than vitamins, even
if the vitamin’s benefits are clear.

Another way to win over investors, especially when the current market looks
small, is to align yourself with a major trend.

If an investor believes a mega-trend is happening—say, AI transforming
workflows or climate tech becoming mainstream—it becomes easier to believe
that your startup can ride that wave:

When investors believed “software is eating the world,” they were more open to
funding vertical tools that looked niche, because they expected big shifts and
rapid adoption.

Without a mega-trend behind you, you’ll often need to be 10x better or cheaper
than incumbents just to get attention.

Analogies can be powerful—but only when they _click_. If the investor gets it,
it sticks.

But don’t just throw out big names or past exits. Think deeply about what the
analogy is _really_ saying. For example, pointing to Evernote or Sunrise as
comps sounds good on paper—but the reality is most of those companies exited
for relatively modest sums and were often acquired for strategic reasons by a
handful of buyers.

So ask: does the analogy highlight strength and scale—or weakness and exit
limitations?

The best analogies either:

  * Tie your startup to a macro shift (“As cloud computing enabled Salesforce, mobile-first tech will enable [your startup]”)

  * Or connect the _founder DNA_ —“These founders are obsessed with product in the same way the Notion team was early on” (though that kind of connection usually emerges from relationship, not pitch decks)

This is the classic “we’re starting with X, but it leads us to Y, which is
_huge_ ” story.

There are two flavors here:

  1. **The bank shot** – where X isn’t a huge business on its own but gets you into a position to build Y. VCs are cautious about this unless you’ve already got serious traction. To make this work, scale X quickly and efficiently, then use the customer base or network effects to unlock the real value in Y.

  2. **The solid base** – where X is already a decent, sustainable business. It might not be a unicorn, but it can deliver solid returns and doesn’t burn tons of capital. That gives you optionality to chase bigger wins later. Investors love this because it balances risk and reward: 5–10x potential with a shot at 20x+ if things break right.

Sometimes the best strategy is to shift the conversation from today’s market
to what the future might look like.

This works well when your core belief is bold and clear. For example, in the
rental or sharing economy: “People spend thousands on things they barely use.
We believe the future is less about ownership and more about access. That
shift will unlock billions in new value.”

This kind of thinking can make a market that _looks_ small today suddenly feel
inevitable—and massive.

**1\. Margins shape how big “big” needs to be.**

If you're building a high-margin business—like SaaS or a marketplace with
clean take rates—your revenue doesn’t need to be sky-high to justify a
billion-dollar valuation. Investors will often use 10x+ revenue multiples for
these businesses.

But if your margins are thin, the revenue target has to be _much_ higher to
reach the same valuation. So when you're doing your market size
math—especially using a bottoms-up approach or comps—make sure you're
adjusting expectations based on your margins.

**2\. Who might buy you matters (a little).**

You usually don’t want to lead with “here’s who might acquire us”—most
investors are betting on category-defining outcomes. But if you're in a space
where the market size is uncertain or the plan includes a bank shot, it helps
to know there are strong potential acquirers in the wings.

Investors rarely make decisions based on downside protection alone—but knowing
that a company is in a category where decent exits have happened can nudge
someone off the fence when the upside case is still developing.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

After working with founders in the Consumer AI space -
[Olivia](https://x.com/omooretweets), a partner at a16z, noticed a clear
pattern that makes subscription businesses work. She shared -

Most successful companies nail at least two of these three metrics, but the
truly exceptional ones hit all three:

  1. High Conversion (4-5%+ from signup to paid)

  2. Strong Retention (40%+ of paying users still active after 12 months)

  3. Organic Acquisition (75%+ of users coming in for free)

Let's break down what happens when you have different combinations:

High Conversion + Strong Retention (but paid acquisition): You can make money
and potentially turn a profit, but everything hinges on managing your customer
acquisition costs (CAC). Your growth will be limited by how quickly you can
recoup your marketing spend.

High Conversion + Organic Acquisition (but poor retention): You'll build both
users and revenue, but low lifetime values are your Achilles' heel. There's
not much room for error since each customer isn't worth as much in the long
run.

Strong Retention + Organic Acquisition (but low conversion): You'll grow your
user base quickly, and people love your product. The challenge? Turning that
love into revenue. You've built a great product, but haven't quite cracked the
business model yet.

The Dream Scenario - All Three: This is what investors get excited about. You
have a business that fills itself with users, converts them efficiently, and
keeps them around. Even if these numbers dip as you scale beyond early
adopters, you have enough cushion to stay healthy.

Think of it like a bucket - you want it to fill itself (organic acquisition),
not leak much (retention) and contain something valuable (paying users). Hit
all three, and you've got something special.

Knowing when to quit and when to stick with it is a key skill for all startup
founders.

Even the best investors in the world aren’t right all the time. So most
investors apply a portfolio approach (Simple word — Broad Portfolio) to spread
their risk and increase the chances of backing a billion-dollar opportunity —
Power Law Guys….

In any investor’s portfolio, you have **three types of startups** : the dogs,
the stars, and the zombies.

**Dogs** run out of cash before finding a scalable business model. These
companies return nothing to the investors.

**Stars** are the home runs — the investments that generate 10x returns and
make up for all the dogs.

**Zombies** are companies that are neither dogs nor stars. They make revenue,
perhaps enough to break even, but not enough to generate a huge return for
investors. Their growth seems stagnant and they can’t consistently generate
more revenue than costs. They are constantly raising money, are focused more
on investors than on customers, and rarely have a unique value proposition
that generates exponentially more value for customers than existing solutions.

Investors see zombie startups as no longer attractive, and not worth a follow-
up investment — which can be the kiss of death for those companies.

**What Creates a Zombie**

If you have read a book by [Seth Godin](https://www.sethgodin.com/) titled The
Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick).

Godin’s main idea is that to be the best in the world, you must quit the wrong
stuff and stick with the right stuff. In the case of startups, it says that
after some initial traction, there comes a dip.

**From there, one of two things happens:**

The dip bounces back and starts to trend upward to scale, or the dip turns
into a cliff and never bounces back. Godin proposes that at the bottom of the
curve — in the dip — founders have to choose to double down or cut their
losses.

The ability to know when to hold them and when to fold them is the difference
between dogs and stars. Zombies happen because some founders get caught up in
the dip, and neither flame out nor take off to greatness.

**How to Tell If Your Startup Is Doomed**

Many signs can alert a founder (or investor) that a startup is stalling and
zombie-bound. But the following signals can show that you may be in a zombie
phase:

  * You don’t want to get out of bed in the morning.

  * You don’t want to go out in public for fear you’ll have to explain what you do.

  * You haven’t hit 10 per cent week-over-week growth on any meaningful metric (revenue, active users, etc).

  * You’ve been working on the same idea for more than a year and still haven’t launched.

  * You’ve launched a consumer service and have less than 2 per cent week-over-week growth in signups.

  * You’ve launched an enterprise service and have less than 2 per cent week-over-week growth in the revenue pipeline.

  * You are the CEO and hole yourself up in the offices so you don’t have to talk to employees and can read TechCrunch.

  * You’ve hired consultants to figure out revenue, culture, or product in a company of less than 10 people.

**What You Can Do About It**

  1. **Accept it.** Call it a day, or as some founders choose to, flame out big. Double down on your efforts and fail large instead of quietly fading away.

  2. **Pivot one of the parts of your business model.** To become a startup unicorn, you likely need an exponential advantage in one of these areas to shift from zombie to star (think: Netflix offers 10x the entertainment of a movie theatre for less than half the cost). There are lots of examples of how a pivot evolved from a zombie into a star: Yelp, YouTube, PayPal, Flickr, Groupon, and Shopify.

  3. **Organize an acquihire and make lemonade from your lemons.** Sometimes, others can leverage what you have built to drive growth in their business. This is often done through an acquihire (buying a company as a means of hiring that startup’s people). While this may not be an optimal outcome, it is often the best choice for zombies.

Unlike on the TV show _[The Walking
Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_\(TV_series\))_ , zombie
status isn’t forever. There are examples of startups pivoting and becoming
stars (and many more examples of startups pivoting and becoming dogs).

But what’s more important is that the decision you make is making a decision.
Do not delude yourself.

Early-stage startups struggle to attract talent when competing with bigger
companies' high salaries. The key? Smart use of ESOP (employee stock options).

The trick is balancing equity with cash compensation. Antler shared a few
decision-making frameworks that can help you design a successful ESOP plan:

It's important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all approach and there
are several factors beyond the seniority levels of employees that need to be
considered before rolling out employee equity.

Equity allocation is a complex yet critical aspect of building a startup's
team. Antler has interviewred several portfolio founders and early-stage
people success leaders to learn about what are some of the best practices in
arriving at the right quantum of ESOPs for a critical hire. You can check the
detailed **[write-up](https://www.antler.co/blog/creating-a-successful-esop-
plan)** on Antler’s website.
