👋 Hey, [Sahil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahilsr/) here — Welcome back to
Venture Curator, where we explore how top investors think, how real founders
build, and the strategies shaping tomorrow’s companies.

  * Where to post your startup and get first users.

  * How to study a new market and build expertise — tactics from a Twitter PM turned healthcare founder.

  * The 3 AI product categories that actually work (and why everything else keeps failing).

##### **FROM OUR PARTNER - WIND HARVEST**

Wind farms leave valuable low-altitude wind untouched because traditional
turbines can’t handle the turbulence.

[Wind Harvest’s ](https://www.startengine.com/offering/wind-harvest)patented
vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) are built to change that. Made from steel
and aluminium, they capture wind below 100 feet, with the potential to double
or more the energy production from existing land.

With new patents, a validated aeroelastic model, and flagship projects in
motion, they’re positioned to become the first into this overlooked space.

Why this matters:

  * $18M+ raised and 8 new patents granted

  * 100GW+ of unused mid-level wind potential around the world

  * Flagship projects in St. Croix are eligible for federal tax incentives

  * Featured in Journal of Physics & awarded USPTO’s “Patents for Humanity”

##### **📜 DEEP DIVE**

If you’re building something new, one of the hardest (and most underestimated)
parts is getting your first users.

You’ve spent days, maybe weeks, writing code, designing the UI, and pushing
features live. But when it’s time to share it with the world, you’re stuck
wondering:  
Where do I even post this? Who’s going to care?

The truth is: distribution matters as much as the product, especially in the
early days. And you don’t need a growth team to get started. What you do need
is a list of places where early adopters, builders, and curious users hang out
and where sharing your startup can actually move the needle.

Here’s a practical breakdown of where to post your startup from launch
platforms to niche communities to software directories that can help you go
from invisible to discovered.

**Launch platforms:**

Great for buzz, validation, and early adopters who love trying new tools.

**Software directories:**

Think of these as long-term SEO and trust-building channels. Great for
credibility.

**Lifetime deals platforms & groups:**

Useful if you want early cash, rapid feedback, and distribution all at once.

**Subreddits (always check the rules before posting anything):**

Not for everyone, but if you post with context and care, it’s a goldmine. You
can even check out our guide on how to [use Reddit to onabrod customers
](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/160562677/how-bb-saas-founders-can-
use-reddit-to-drive-leads-a-step-by-step-guide)for your startup.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Most founders try to “study” a new industry with research reports, Statista
charts, or high-level TAM decks.[ Othman Laraki](https://x.com/othman) (ex-
Google/Twitter PM, now co-founder/CEO of Colour, a billion-dollar healthcare
company) took a different path: he learned healthcare by building into it.

Here’s a practical framework you can use if you’re breaking into a market you
don’t know.

**1\. Map how money really flows (don’t stop at the buyer).**

In healthcare, the patient isn’t the buyer. The insurer or employer often
pays. Clinicians influence decisions, but administrators handle approvals.
Laraki sat down with claims adjusters, procurement managers, and even lab
operators to understand:

media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57b33c86-3873-4309-b60f-e0310a352984_2400x1350.png)You

Do this for your own market. Draw a flowchart from first touch → payment
collected. Until you see each actor and their incentive, you don’t understand
the market.

**2\. Run a unit economics teardown.**

Instead of guessing, Laraki decomposed the cost of delivering a genetic test,
line by line. He set a target price ($250 vs. the $4,000 incumbents charged)
and worked backwards:

  * Negotiate with suppliers (“ask for a discount” was a rule, not a hope).

  * Unbundle inputs (suppliers often add hidden buffers).

  * Spot timing incentives (end-of-quarter discounts, prepayment benefits).

Try the same: build a spreadsheet of every cost driver. Then ask, for each
line item: “How can I bend this?”

**3\. Test whether your wedge is a feature or a solution.**

Colour’s first wedge was low-cost testing. But insurers didn’t care; they
priced by median cost across labs, not the cheapest option. A $250 test was
just a feature. The solution buyers actually wanted? A vertically integrated
cancer care clinic that reduced overall spend.

post-
media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc909e580-944e-4bac-8d1e-e411357234fd_2400x1350.png)You

Apply this lens: if your product is a “better part,” ask who needs a “whole
car.” Sometimes you need to bundle your tech into a broader solution to unlock
budgets.

**4\. Talk to operators, not celebrities.**

Instead of chasing famous doctors or regulators, Laraki reached out to genetic
counsellors, lab managers, and non-famous scientists. These were the people
actually running the processes Colour needed to integrate into.

Your move: make a list of the doers in your industry. Cold email them with a
mission-driven story. They’ll tell you how transactions really happen.

**5\. Treat pivots as progress, not failure.**

Laraki cycled through:

  * DTC tests (failed: CAC too high, LTV too low).

  * Selling via physicians (failed: billing friction too high).

  * Employer health plans (worked: aligned with budgets).

  * Expanded into a full clinic (big unlock).  
Don’t cling to your first model. Every failed buyer segment is data that
sharpens where the incentives align.

**6\. Don’t mistake false positives for traction.**

Colour scored early deals because of influence (warm networks, Stripe founder
referral). But those didn’t generalise. Laraki’s test: could a stranger buy
this product on standard terms? If not, you don’t yet have PMF.

Run the same filter: strip away influence. Would the product still close
deals?

Mini checklist founders can run this week

  * Map one real transaction in your target market from first touch to cash collected. Name each actor and their incentive.

  * Identify your product’s current status on the buyer’s ladder: feature, component, or solution. If it’s a feature, who can you bundle with to become a solution?

  * List the top three cost drivers and one concrete action to bend each (renegotiate, alternate supplier, process change).

  * Book five calls with non-celebrity operators who move money or approvals. Ask them to redline your transaction map.

  * Write your “no influence” test: how would a cold buyer discover, evaluate, purchase, and activate without your network?

Most founders think they’re building an AI product, but in reality, they’re
just shipping another chatbot with a wrapper. [Sean Goedecke’s
piece](https://www.seangoedecke.com/ai-products/) cuts through the noise:
despite billions poured into AI, only a few product types consistently produce
value.

Everything else struggles because it either competes with ChatGPT or forces
users into a chat interface they don’t actually want.’

**1\. Pure Chatbots (only win in very narrow niches)**

ChatGPT already dominates general-purpose chat. If your product is “ChatGPT
but for X,” users will simply go back to ChatGPT. The only chatbot category
that survives is explicit roleplay—AI companions, emotional support, NSFW
interactions—basically things big labs won’t allow.

Why these niches work:

  * Users want content OpenAI/Claude won’t generate

  * Less capable models are fine if they’re more permissive

  * Strong emotional attachment creates retention

But the defensibility is weak. As labs relax content rules, these products
will be eaten alive.

**2\. Completions (the most underrated, highest-ROI category)**

This is the GitHub Copilot → Cursor → Replit “autocomplete on steroids” model.
It works because users never talk to the AI. They type, and the system
instantly predicts and completes what they need.

This category wins because:

This is why coding assistants exploded. The opportunity is wide open in areas
like documents, spreadsheets, CRM updates, legal drafting, product workflows,
sales proposals—anywhere autocomplete can replace chat.

A simple rule: AI that users don’t interact with directly is the AI that
scales fastest.

**3\. Agentic Products (the next wave, actually working in the wild)**

Agents aren’t chatbots with tools. They’re systems that take one instruction
and execute entire workflows by themselves—write code, fix bugs, rerun tests,
and repeat.

Coding is the first domain where this works because:

  * Output can be verified (tests, compile)

  * Labs fine-tune heavily for coding

  * Tasks are structured and sequential

The big question now is whether agents can work beyond coding. Early signals
are pointing to research-heavy fields like law, finance, ops, and
compliance—places where the agent can search, extract, compare, verify, and
package findings without waiting for user input.

Two categories aren’t fully working yet but are being heavily invested in.

**AI-generated feeds:** OpenAI, Meta, xAI—all are trying infinite
recommendation + infinite generation. If quality hits TikTok-level
addictiveness, this becomes a huge consumer shift.

**AI-native games :** Game cycles are long, gamers distrust AI, and generated
dialogue is still uncanny. But once someone cracks AI-driven worlds or NPCs
with memory, this becomes a new genre.

**What founders should actually do with this**

Most ideas fail because they fall into the “chat UX trap.” Chat is convenient
for demos, bad for real workflows. The winning pattern across every successful
AI product is the same:

  * Make AI silent where possible

  * Let AI do full workflows, not single steps

  * Build around proprietary data, not general knowledge

  * Avoid competing with the base model

  * Use chat only where emotion, roleplay, or creativity matter

The best AI products make users forget they’re using AI at all. If you want, I
can turn this into:

  * a shorter Quick Win summary

  * a “Steal This Idea” opportunity list

  * a polished LinkedIn version

  * or a founder checklist for building the right AI product
