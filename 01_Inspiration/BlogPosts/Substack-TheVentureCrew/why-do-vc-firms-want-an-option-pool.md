I have been interacting with so many founders at events or during pitch
sessions or finalizing investments in their startups, I observed that almost
all founders get confused when VCs say they will invest some amount at pre-
money. Let’s take an example.

“When a VC says they will invest $10 million pre-money” - it means $10 million
**inclusive of any ESOP** the startup will be set aside for future employees.
At the same moment, they always have a query about why it’s not exclusive and
why investors saying it’s inclusive. So If you are a founder or aspiring
investor it’s really important for you to understand the math behind it. So
let’s deep dive into it - Why do VC Firms Want an Option Pool Before the VC
Round?

Let’s do simple mathematics to understand this. We will take the two scenarios
of the founder considering the option pool before & after vc round. This will
help you to get a better idea.  

**First Scenario: Founders create a 15% Option Pool before VC Round**  

Suppose - Founder A and Founder B started a Business with the following
shares.  

\- Number of shares with Founder A= 10,000  
\- Number of shares with Founder B= 5,000  
\- Total number of shares= 10,000+5,000= 15,000  

\- Option Pool= 15% (Founder Considering option pool before vc round)  
\- Number of new shares for Option Pool/ (Number of New shares for Option
Pool+ Total Number of old shares)= 15%  
\- Number of new shares to be issued for Option Pool= (15,000*15%)/ (1-15%)=
2,647  

\- Total number of shares after Option Pool= 15,000+2,647= 17,647  

\- Now a VC Firm is investing= $2m  
\- Let’s say the Pre-money valuation of the company= is $8m  
\- Post-money valuation= $2m+ $8m= $10m  
\- Dilution= $2m/ $10m= 20%  

\- Number of new shares to be issued for VC Firm / (Number of New shares to be
issued for VC Firm+ Total number of shares after Option Pool)= 20%  

\- Number of new shares to be issued for VC Firm= ( 17,647*20%)/ (1-20%)=
4,412  
\- Total number of shares after VC round= 17,647+ 4,412= 22,059  

Final Ownership Structure:  
\- Founder A= 10,000/ 22,059= 45.33%  
\- Founder B= 5,000/22,059= 22.67%  
\- Option Pool= 2,647/ 22,059= 12%  
\- VC Firm= 4,412/ 22,059= 20%  

**Now Consider a Second Scenario: Founders create a 15% Option Pool after VC
Round**  

\- Number of shares with Founder A= 10,000  
\- Number of shares with Founder B= 5,000  
\- Total number of shares= 10,000+5,000= 15,000  

\- VC Firm wants 20% ownership  
\- New shares to be issued for VC Firm= (15,000*20%)/(1-20%)= 3,750  
\- Total number of shares after VC round= 15,000+ 3,750= 18,750  

\- Next, the Company creates a 15% Option Pool (As the founder considering the
option pool after VC funding)  
\- New shares to be issued for Option Pool= (18,750*15%)/ (1-15%)= 3,309  
\- Total number of shares after Option Pool= 18,750+ 3,309= 22059  

Final Ownership Structure:  
\- Founder A= 10,000/ 22,059= 45.33%  
\- Founder B= 5,000/ 22,059= 22.67%%  
\- Option Pool= 3,309/ 22,059= 15%  
\- VC Firm= 3,750/ 22,059= 17%  

If you compare the Second Scenario with the First Scenario, you will find that  

\- VC Firm’s ownership has been reduced from 20% to 17%  
\- Both Founders’ ownerships are unchanged  
\- The Option Pool has been increased from 12% to 15%  

And that’s why VC Firms prefer an Option Pool before the Investment.

That’s It. I hope this helps you to get an idea - Why do VC Firms Want an
Option Pool Before the VC Round
