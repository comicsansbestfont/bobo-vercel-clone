##### **INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY WORTH EXPLORING**

This fast-growing health brand is turning heads in the investment world:
**[ShapeAccelerator](https://wefunder.com/shapeaccelerator1?_bhlid=424c94e1d2b21190c6fb10d04aa13c974a021458)**
isn’t just another weight-loss product—it’s an award-winning, science-backed
solution with real clinical results and explosive market demand.

**Why it matters:**

  * The global weight-loss market is booming, growing at 9.7% CAGR.

  * Most products lack scientific backing or fail to deliver lasting results.

**Why I’m watching:**

  * 500% sales growth in 2024, with strong traction.

  * National media exposure, including CNN, HGTV & a Times Square campaign.

  * Expanding into Europe & Asia by 2026, signalling global demand.

With 20X ROI potential, this is a rare chance to invest in a science-driven
consumer brand at the tipping point of massive growth.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Problem-Solution Fit and Product-Market Fit are often a point of confusion for
early founders. On the surface, these two definitions are virtually identical
= find a valuable product in a big enough market. However, the solutions in
the Problem-Solution Fit stage are often different to those in the Product-
Market Fit stage.

> This is because Problem-Solution Fit focuses on a tiny group of [early-
> evangelists ](https://x.com/sahils_r/status/1894033896863621476)who are
> comfortable with missing features, as long as it solves their core problem.
> (Bad UX, no onboarding, and manual work-arounds are part of the fun!)
>
> Whilst solutions during the Product-Market Fit stage focus on selling your
> product to a larger mainstream market. These solutions need to have a more
> robust set of features. (Reliability, Security, Reporting, and a decent UX
> is a common ask for these customers).

**Problem-Solution Fit Example**

David Wang, founder of product academy shared this example - “A great example
I’ve experienced recently was assessing a content moderation tool for the
company I currently work for.

My company is on a mission to create the most trusted destination on the
internet. We want to moderate all content hosted on our platform to protect
visitors.

Our team scoured the internet to find a tool that fit our requirements. After
weeks of searching, we came across a startup that friends in the industry
highly recommended. Their product was easy to use, had an AI engine that makes
our lives easier, and had a few customers using it - a great demonstration of
Problem-Solution Fit!

However, due to the size of our remote-first workforce, information security
was a key need for us. We require features like Single-Sign-On and specific
security certifications that the startup didn’t offer.

As a result, we ended up choosing another tool with fewer features but focused
on a more robust set of features on information security. When we broke the
news to the founders, they were disappointed but understood their product
wasn’t right for us.

We departed amicably, and the startup will reach out again when they have the
security features we require.

Now… could the startup have built the security features that we need?
Absolutely.

But more importantly, was my company the right customer for them? Probably
not.

They were focused on smaller startups with different sets of needs. To change
their product just for my company would’ve meant overheads that were not worth
it for them.

The moral of the story is that **“everyone” is not your customer.**

When you’re trying to find a Problem-Solution Fit, your customers must be your
“early-evangelists”—these are customers that would scream and shout about your
product.

Once you’ve found a strong base of “early-evangelists" you can move into a
bigger market to find Product-Market Fit.

Here is a quick comparison between your PSF customers vs your PMF customers:

Deciding whether to offer a freemium model is a common dilemma for founders.
Many try out freemium strategies, but not all SaaS companies can replicate the
success of Dropbox or Typeform.

Done wrong, freemium can end up cannibalizing your paid user base while also
draining your company’s precious engineering and customer support resources.

So how can you determine if it's the right move for your company? The most
reliable way to find out is through A/B testing. However, getting solid
results can take a long time, especially if you're looking at the impact on
virality and your viral cycle is six months or longer.

If you can't wait that long or aren't set up for a full A/B test, consider
these "Three Factors for Freemium Strategy":

  1. **Does your paid plan have a gross margin of 80–90%?**  
If you have a lower gross margin — for example because your product is not
fully self-service, requires extensive customer support or is extremely costly
in terms of tech infrastructure — freemium will probably not work for you.

  2. **Does your free plan attract the right audience?**  
If your free users are too different from your paying users, your free-to-
paying conversion will be low — and you’ll risk developing your product for
the wrong audience.

  3. **Is your product inherently viral?**  
If your answer is no, that doesn’t make it a complete no-go, but it does mean
that it’s much less likely that freemium is right for you.

In the end, freemium only makes sense if a certain percentage of your free
users do one of three things:

  * Eventually, convert to paid, 

  * Refer paying customers, or 

  * Provide the kind of valuable feedback that will improve your product. 

A freemium product that fails to achieve any of these effects will merely
saddle you with extra costs and distract you from servicing your most
important users.

Also, there is one interesting article on [why companies fail with
freemium](https://medium.com/swlh/why-do-companies-fail-with-
freemium-600e6b607127). I highly recommend checking it out, it’s worth
reading.

Starting a business with co-founders is like embarking on a long road trip
together. While the journey can be more enjoyable with partners who complement
your skills, even the strongest relationships need ground rules. This is where
a founder agreement comes in.

Simply put, a founders agreement is a legal contract between company founders
that sets clear guidelines for their business relationship. Think of it as a
roadmap that outlines everyone's rights, roles, responsibilities, and
expectations from day one.

**Why You Need One**

While not legally required, having a founder agreement is crucial because it:

  * Prevents misunderstandings by getting everyone on the same page

  * Provides a clear structure for handling disputes

  * Shows potential investors you're serious and well-organized

  * Protects both your business and personal relationships

As [Simon Bacher, CEO of Ling](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonbacher/), puts
it: "My wife and I co-founded our startup, and we saw a founders agreement as
essential - think of it like a prenup for your business."

**Key Components of a Strong Founders Agreement**

**1\. Basic Company Information**

**2\. Roles and Responsibilities**

  * Each founder's specific duties and areas of authority

  * Clear job titles and their limitations

  * Flexibility for role changes as the company grows

**3\. Decision-Making Powers**

**4\. Equity and Vesting**

  * Each founder's ownership percentage

  * Vesting schedule (typically four years with a one-year cliff)

  * Conditions for receiving full rights to shares

  * Compensation plans

**5\. Commitments and Resources**

  * Expected time commitment from each founder

  * Initial capital contributions

  * Intellectual property rights

  * Other resources (industry connections, expertise)

**6\. Exit Planning**

  * Conditions for dissolving the company

  * What happens during an IPO

  * Handling of unvested shares

  * Non-compete and non-solicitation terms

Now that you know what goes into this document, here are a few founder’s
agreement templates and examples to help you craft your own.

  * [University of Pennsylvania Law](https://www.law.upenn.edu/clinic/entrepreneurship/startupkit/founders-agreement.pdf): Includes provisions about ownership structure, transfer of ownership, decision-making and dispute resolutions, representations and warranties, and choice of law

  * [Harvard Business School](https://startupguide.hbs.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Founders-Agreement-Template.docx): Includes provisions on ownership, competition restriction, and exit situations

You’re going to go through many ups and downs with your partners. Creating a
founders agreement is an excellent way to ensure you’re all protected
throughout your business journey.
