##### **START WITH**

Every AI founder I talk to thinks they need to hit "hockey stick" growth to
succeed. They're burning through cash trying to replicate the explosive
numbers they read about in TechCrunch, wondering why their solid 20% month-
over-month growth feels like failure.

Bessemer Venture Partners just released their [State of AI 2025
report](https://www.bvp.com/atlas/the-state-of-ai-2025), and it reveals
something fascinating - there are two completely different ways to win in AI,
and most founders are chasing the wrong one.

After studying 20 high-growth AI startups, BVP discovered that successful AI
companies fall into two distinct categories. Understanding which path you're
on could save you months of misguided strategy.

**The Tale of Two AI Startups**

  * **The "Supernovas"** hit $40M ARR in year one and $125M in year two. Sounds incredible, right? Here's the catch - they often operate at 25% gross margins (sometimes negative) because they're fighting winner-take-all battles in red-hot competitive spaces. These companies live dangerously close to being "thin wrappers" around foundation models.

  * **The "Shooting Stars"** take a steadier path: $3M to $12M to $40M to $103M over four years, maintaining healthy 60% gross margins. They look more like stellar SaaS companies - strong product-market fit, loyal customers, predictable growth.

**What Else Does the Report Reveal**

**Infrastructure consolidation is real.** Foundation models are settling
around OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Llama and xAI. The opportunity isn't
building another model - it's creating compound AI systems that combine
retrieval, memory, and planning.

**Memory is the new moat.** Current AI tools are like brilliant consultants
with amnesia. They're smart in the moment but forget everything between
sessions. Companies solving persistent memory will create the deepest customer
loyalty.

**Enterprise systems are cracking.** AI dropped implementation time by 90%
because it translates business logic into code automatically. Companies like
Day.ai and Attio are auto-logging customer interactions. The strategy? Start
with an "AI Trojan horse" feature, then expand.

**"Technophobic" industries are adopting fast.** Healthcare (Abridge for
clinical notes), legal (EvenUp for demand packages), and education
(MagicSchool for teachers) show 10x productivity gains. The pattern: pick
manual, language-heavy workflows as your wedge.

**Browser becomes the new OS.** Think Perplexity's Comet browser - not just
search, but a programmable interface where agents can observe and execute
across the entire digital world.

**Video generation hits 2026.** After images (2024) and voice (2025), video
will cross the commercial threshold next year. Google's Veo 3 and OpenAI's
Sora are approaching production-grade quality.

**Evaluation infrastructure matters.** Public benchmarks tell you nothing
about real-world performance. Companies building private, use-case-specific
evaluation systems will have massive advantages as AI moves to production.

**M &A wave incoming.** Legacy enterprise giants are buying AI capabilities
rather than building. If you're creating domain-specific tools, expect
acquisition interest.

AI will change the way we shop - from where we find products to how we
evaluate them, when we buy, and much more.

This raises a question: What types of purchases will be disrupted, and where
does opportunity exist in the age of AI?

a16z recently shared a [framework](https://a16z.com/ai-x-commerce/) from
[Justine Moore ](https://x.com/venturetwins/status/1955287508394127800)and
Alex Rampell that categorises consumer commerce into five categories based on
the level of consideration required for a purchase.

The takeaway: AI will disrupt these categories at different speeds, and the
biggest near-term opportunities sit in the middle.

Candy bars at checkout, funny shirts on TikTok, no research, no deliberation.
AI’s role is limited to hyper-targeted, personalised ads that appear at the
right moment.

Groceries, cleaning supplies, pet food. You know what you like, but AI can act
as an autopilot buyer, tracking prices, predicting when you’ll run out, and
ordering at the best deal.

Luxury skincare, a designer bag, home décor, researched, but not life-
changing. AI can serve as a personal shopper, finding, ranking, and explaining
the best picks based on your taste, past purchases, and style.

Laptops, sofas, bikes, high-cost, long-term items. AI’s role here is deep
research plus consultation: a back-and-forth “expert” conversation that
compares across brands and matches your exact needs.

Homes, cars, weddings, degrees, rare, high-stakes decisions. You won’t fully
outsource them, but AI coaches can guide research, flag risks, and even help
negotiate terms.

**The opportunity:**

The middle three, routine essentials, lifestyle purchases, and functional
purchases are where AI can create the biggest disruption fast. They’re big
markets with enough complexity for AI to add value, but not so high-stakes
that people resist automation.

The boom years of 2021–2022 saw record fundraising for first-time VC managers,
$24B raised in 2021 alone. But the sequel is proving far harder to finance.

PitchBook data shows:

  * Of first-time managers who raised in 2021, only **33%** have closed a second fund.

  * For those who launched in 2022, it’s just **12%**.

  * Historically, most have raised Fund II within 3 years. Now, many are stalled.

Why?

  * Capital concentration: In H1 2025, just 12 large firms raised over 50% of all VC capital, leaving less for emerging managers.

  * LP mindset shift: More LPs are doubling down on “power law” funds with proven access to unicorns.

  * Economic uncertainty: Volatile markets and political shifts (like US clean energy rollbacks) make LPs more cautious.

  * Overexposure to venture: LP capital is tied up from the 2021–22 surge, with weak returns across the board.

Fund II isn’t just about proving PMF for your investment thesis; it’s about
surviving in a market where LP dollars are concentrated at the top, liquidity
is scarce, and macro headwinds make new commitments harder to win.
* * *

##### **SOMETHING MORE**

Forget the $50M seed round headlines, unless you’re an OpenAI alum or an
outlier, those numbers don’t reflect reality. Most founders raise far less,
and understanding the real medians will save you time, stress, and false
comparisons.

Recently, Carta shared [some
data](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peterjameswalker_startups-fundraising-
founders-activity-7360379503346376706-G_Rh/) on this, which you should look:

**What the data shows (last 12 months, primary rounds only):**

  * Seed: Median $3.5M. 70% of rounds are under $5M.

  * Series A: Median $11M. Most common range is $10M–$19M. $50M+ rounds are extremely rare.

  * Series B: Median $20.3M. Huge variation, some at $9M, others at $55M.

  * Series C: Median $36.8M. $50M+ is common here, but plenty raise smaller.

**What this means for founders:**

  * Don’t plan your raise based on press releases. They’re often the exception, not the norm.

  * Your funding needs should align with your business model, not vanity numbers.

  * Smaller rounds (especially pre-seed/seed) can be closed faster using **SAFEs** rather than priced equity, but stacking multiple SAFEs can cause headaches when they all convert later.

  * In AI and other capital-heavy spaces, question early how much it will take to build something generational.

Run your race. The right raise size is the one that gets you to your next big
milestone, not the one that looks good in TechCrunch.

Even with $0 in sales, your startup can have a strong valuation if you
understand the levers investors pull. Valuation isn’t just about money coming
in; it’s about perceived potential, team credibility, and the size of the
opportunity.

**Pre-revenue reality:**

  * You don’t have revenue yet, but investors still see value in the story you’re building.

  * Early credibility builds trust with partners and makes it easier to attract top talent.

  * Market perception plays a big role, how you’re seen will influence deal terms and equity split.

**The common methods investors use:**

  * **Berkus Method** : Values five areas (idea, team, product, market, launch) at up to $500K each, capping most valuations at ~$2.5M.

  * **Scorecard Method** : Benchmarks your startup against similar ones, adjusting for strengths, weaknesses, and competitive landscape.

  * **VC Method** : Starts from a projected exit revenue, applies profit multiples, and works backwards to match investor ROI targets.

  * **Risk Factor Method** : Rates 12 risk categories from team quality to market size, adding or subtracting value based on each.

**Boosting your valuation before revenue:**

  * Build an MVP to prove you can deliver.

  * Showcase a strong, credible founding team with relevant track records.

  * Choose market comps that work in your favour.

  * Land early sales or pilots before fundraising to show momentum.

We’ve included a detailed breakdown of each method, plus an [Excel valuation
calculator](https://theventurecrew.gumroad.com/l/valuationguide?layout=profile)
for each method, in our full guide: [Valuation
Guide](https://theventurecrew.gumroad.com/l/valuationguide?layout=profile)

[Sara Santanen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sara-santanen/), Product Marketing
Consultant at FletchPMM, points out a mistake she sees over and over: founders
chase big, cross-company problems that no one actually owns.

Founders love to paint a picture of a massive pain:

  * Broken workflows

  * Endless manual work

  * Dropped handoffs

  * Duplicated effort

  * Wasted time

The problem? In the target company, no single person is responsible for fixing
it.

If no one owns the problem, no one is actively searching for (or budgeting
for) a solution.

What happens in practice:

  * Founder: “We solve X, and it’s a big company-wide problem.”

  * Investor/Advisor: “Is that why people book demos?”

  * Founder: “Not really, they usually have problem Z or Y.”

  * Advisor: “Right… but Z and Y aren’t connected to X in their minds, are they?”

Her takeaway: **In the early stage, focus on a problem that someone owns,
feels, and can take action on.**

Asana could have pitched “cross-departmental collaboration”, but they started
with project management for individual teams, a pain point that had a clear
owner.

The startup graveyard is full of tools that solved “everyone’s problem” and
therefore no one’s.

Recently, Greg shared an interesting [video on the IKEA
effect](https://x.com/gregisenberg/status/1955439410037821891) and how
founders can apply this in their startup:

People value things more when they’ve built part of it themselves; that’s the
IKEA effect. Your customers can feel the same way about your product if you
design it right.

**How to make it work (with examples):**

Instead of everything pre-set, guide users to configure it themselves.

Example: Notion’s empty workspace prompts you to add your own pages and
templates you feel like you built your system from scratch.

Give customers building blocks they can arrange. Example: Canva lets you start
with a template but modify colours, text, and layouts turning “their” design
into “your” design.

Invite beta users to give feedback before launch. Example: Figma grew a
passionate community by running open betas and shipping features shaped
directly by user requests.

Offer flexibility rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. Example:
Airtable’s product looks simple at first, but users quickly mould it into CRM
systems, project trackers, or content calendars tailored to their workflow.

When users invest effort, they invest emotionally. That makes your product
harder to leave and easier to love.

Many startups proudly declare they’ve found product–market fit (PMF). But
there’s a quieter, equally critical test: business-model–product fit (BMPF),
making sure the way you charge sustainably exceeds the cost to deliver.

Recently, [Chris Paik](https://x.com/cpaik) shared an interesting [article
titled as Cursor’s
problem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q3O7niwoxsyfJ5zSx8dgYzipEgBkUqXzLejQQ-
PQNWs/edit?tab=t.0). It shared - Cursor’s story is a cautionary tale.

They sold “unlimited” coding on top of expensive variable-cost AI models from
OpenAI/Anthropic. That’s fixed revenue, rising costs, the same trap that
buried MoviePass, Oyster, and “Unlimited” ClassPass.

The danger signs:

  * **Cohort inversion** : light, profitable users churn; heavy, unprofitable ones stay.

  * **Topline masking rot** : growth hides deteriorating margins.

  * **Subsidies mistaken for product love** : usage spikes when prices are artificially low, but demand collapses when costs are passed on.

Uber and DoorDash survived early subsidies because they had a path to
operational efficiency (density, batching, utilisation) and future pricing
power. Without that bridge, subsidies just burn cash.

For variable-cost businesses, especially in AI, the lesson is simple:

  * Price in proportion to usage costs.

  * Cap or segment high-cost users early.

  * Test demand at the true marginal cost before declaring PMF.

> If customers disappear when the subsidy disappears, you don’t have PMF, you
> have **subsidy–market fit**.
