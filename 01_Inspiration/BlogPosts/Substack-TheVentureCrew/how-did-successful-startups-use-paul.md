Ralph Emerson would probably not have been an outstanding entrepreneur.

Now, Emerson lived 150 years before the iPhone. However many believe the idea
still resonates today -

_If you build a better mousetrap, people will find it naturally, and your
startup will take off._

**Simple, right?**

In reality, building a better mousetrap is usually not enough. It’s not enough
to be very good. To get something from 0 to 1 typically requires something
remarkable It takes solving a problem others haven’t solved.

**Startups take off because** the founders make them take off by doing well
what was never done before. Usually, it takes some sort of push to get them
going.

Many of you might be aware of the term called - **“Do things that don’t
scale”** which is popularized by Paul Graham in his **[2013
essay](https://paulgraham.com/ds.html)**. I am sure, you’ve read that article
too, but **Do successful startups use this strategy at an early stage?** &
**What does it take to follow this strategy and does it practically work?**

To answer all these questions I thought to share my views and how startups
like Reddit, Doordash and other Y-Combinator startups used this strategy to
build their business. So Grab your coffee and let’s deep dive into it. ☕

**In Simple words “Do things that don’t scale” means** -  

`“Early-stage startups should focus on learning and validating their business
model rather than on growth. This means doing efficient and effective things,
even if they don't scale well. For example, a startup might initially make
manual sales calls to each customer, rather than building a complex automated
sales system.”`

But does every successful startup follow this strategy at its early stage? I
have **studied 50+ successful startups** and found that almost all startups
used this strategy in their early days.

To get clarity on this in a better way, let’s see how some startups used this
strategy :

  1. **DoorDash**

**[DoorDash](https://www.doordash.com/)** , backed by Y Combinator, is one of
numerous digital businesses that employ logistical services to provide on-
demand meal delivery from restaurants. Here’s a little extract from the
founder, **[Stanley Tang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanleytang/)** , on how
to get started and avoid doing things that don’t grow.

“They created a landing page in the afternoon and were conducting restaurant
pick-ups and deliveries by the evening (while still in college!). Yes, within
a single day.

Consider this an experiment; just put it out there and see what happens! In
the beginning, your goal should be to gather input and ensure that you’re not
dealing with a personal bias! The greatest aspect is that you will be able to
communicate with your consumers and gain real-time feedback! _This may not
work for everyone, but for the other 90% of ideas, you’re sitting on waiting
to construct a “polished & shiny” product before launching, well…_”

You don’t need algorithms or flawless web pages to solve a genuine issue. All
you need is a clean landing page and some tinkering to make things work.

  2. **Airbnb**

**[Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co/)** probably has the most talked about
articles, podcasts, and videos in the how-they-did-things-that-didn’t-scale-
but-got-them-to-where-they-are-now category.

Take one out of the **[book](https://www.amazon.in/Hacking-Growth-Morgan-
Brown/dp/0753545373)** “Hacking Growth” by Sean Ellis:

“Brian and Joe were astonished to find, when establishing the company, that
New York City, despite its tourist appeal, was underachieving. ‘The graphics
were fairly horrible,’ co-founder Joe Gebbia recalls after browsing over their
posts. People were taking Craigslist-style images with their phones. Surprise!
No one was booking because you couldn’t see what you were paying for.” One of
their early backers, Paul Grahan of YC, advised that the two attempt a low-
tech, high-effort hack to boost bookings — but it was fast to deploy and was
incredibly effective.

Chesky and Gebbia rented a $500 camera and went door to door throughout the
city, capturing as many listings as they could. They then compared the number
of reservations for the upgraded image listings to the rest of the Updated
York ads and found that the updated photos led to two to three times more
bookings, instantly doubling their profits from New York.

After establishing their concept, they extended it to Paris, London,
Vancouver, and Miami, with similar results. As a response, Airbnb decided to
create a photography service that would allow hosts to hire a professional
photographer to come to their home and photograph it. It began in the summer
of 2010 with 20 photographers and grew to over 2000 freelance photographers by
2012, documenting 13,000 listings across six continents.”

All of the other tactics would have likely aided scaling, but Brian Chesky and
Joe Gebbia stuck to things that didn’t scale at all but did help them find the
true challenges that consumers were experiencing. It’s easy to lose sight of
your North Star Metric in the chase of vanity or needless growth measures, but
sticking to the basics and focusing on where you want to go is crucial.

  3. **Groupon**

Andrew Mason and the **[Groupon](https://www.groupon.com/)** team debuted the
initial iteration as a WordPress site. Everything else, apart from posting a
transaction, was done by hand.

It was **completely ghetto**. On the early version of Groupon, we would offer
t-shirts. In the [write-up], we’d state, ‘This t-shirt will be available in
red, size big.’ Please contact us if you want a different colour or size.’ We
didn’t have a form for that… It was sufficient to demonstrate the idea and
demonstrate that it was something that people enjoyed… It got to the point
where we’d sell 500 sushi vouchers in a day while also sending 500 PDFs to
individuals through Apple Mail.

Even Reddit has used this strategy “Do Things That Don’t Scale” to just get a
lift from the ground…

  4. **Reddit**

On **[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)** 's first day, “Steve and Alexis (Co-
Founders) had to start with no users and a blank page. Their strategy involved
creating subreddits before the official launch. They ran ads to attract users
interested in various topics and implemented an influencer strategy to have
influencers moderate subreddits. On launch day, they aimed for a big splash
with hundreds of thousands of signups. They used a tool to submit fake links
with invented usernames to create the illusion of a thriving community. Even
when emailing their initial six friends, it seemed like there was already a
page full of users.

But both of them found that someone other than them submitted a link on a non-
launch day. After a night out, he forgot to load fake links the next morning.
To his surprise, the site wasn't blank because there were already a
significant number of other users submitting links. This early success, with
20 or 30 people participating, marked a major milestone for Reddit.”

  5. **Cruise**

**[Cruise](https://getcruise.com/)** , during its time at Y Combinator,
developed the first version of its driverless car in just three months. Kyle
and his small team retrofitted an Audi, though calling it fully "driverless"
would be an exaggeration. The car had a mysterious red button on the floor,
limited functionality to highways, essentially working like adaptive cruise
control, and struggled even with simple challenges like shadows. In contrast
to Google's advanced retrofitted cars, Cruise's initial version highlighted
the humble beginnings of autonomous vehicle technology.

  6. **Zappos**

It wasn’t obvious in 2000 that **[buying shoes
online](https://www.zappos.com/)** was a lucrative business. Shoes come in a
variety of sizes and comfort levels, and many people believed they had to be
worn before they could be sold. “Will people purchase shoes online?” was the
most dangerous question for founder Nick Swinmurn’s young firm. One solution
would be to acquire millions of dollars in finance, construct a massive
warehouse, load it with shoes, construct a full e-commerce system, staff a
slew of workers, and cross your fingers and hope customers make orders.

Nick thought there had to be a simpler method to de-risk his company. Instead,
he went to FootLocker and photographed their inventory. He uploaded images of
the shoes on the internet. When someone made an order, he went to Foot Locker
and bought the shoes, then sent them to the customer.

Is this a scalable model? Nope. Did he profit from each order? No way. Was he
successful in demonstrating that consumers will buy shoes online and gain
early traction? Yes.

  7. **Zynga**

In an interview - Mark Pincus, the creator of
**[Zynga](https://www.zynga.com/)** , is asked what the ideal approach to do
market research is. His response: “Ghetto Test.” If someone wants to develop,
say, a hospital simulator, he creates a Facebook ad that reads, “Ever wanted
to manage your hospital?” and links to a survey (or, if it’s ghetto, a 404
page).

Zynga just has to monitor CTR and compare it to past historical rates to get a
solid picture of demand. This is useful for comparing numerous game concepts,
product ideas, taglines, names, and so on. therefore, is not a suitable match
for experimenting with a novel idea (without a comparison).

  8. **Seamless**

The people at **[Seamless](https://www.seamless.com/)** are said to have spent
their first several months without a web product. They contacted legal firms
in New York and inquired about their lunch preferences. They contacted the
restaurant, made an order, oversaw delivery, and billed the companies at the
end of the month…..

If you read these carefully, you will find that there is one thing common
between these startups at the “Do things that don’t scale, pre-product market
fit” stage, which is  

”`founders ability to embrace the less glamorous work, low-status work and
focus on getting shit done.”`

**So as a CEO/Founder of a startup - What Does It Take To Implement “Do Things
That Don’t Scale” For Your Startup?**

In the early days of a startup, especially before hitting the sweet spot where
your product meets the market's needs, being a CEO and co-founder is **a far
cry from the image of a high-flying, visionary leader.** Forget about the
grand ideas and the spotlight; it's time to dive into the nitty-gritty.

**Instead of chasing after the glamorous and high-status tasks** , the real
deal is to roll up your sleeves and embrace the less-than-exciting work that
needs to be done. The mantra here is to "do things that don't scale."

As a CEO in these early stages, your job is **to get your hands dirty, tackle
the toughest and least appealing tasks,** and personally make sure every part
of the startup is running like a well-oiled machine.

Unlike the typical picture of a CEO as a powerful and big-picture thinker, the
truth in a startup's “**early days is about doing whatever it takes to keep
the whole system running smoothly.”** Founders need to shift their mindset
away from mimicking the leaders of giant, established companies and instead
focus on the hands-on, gritty work needed to make things happen in the initial
phases of their startup journey.

I come across a bunch of super smart people, but when it comes to finding
their own thing? Not their favourite. Why? Well, brainiacs usually avoid the
not-so-fun tasks, like dealing with customer service or handling angry
customers.

But for founders, it's a different story. **They have to get their hands
dirty, especially in the early days.**

Sure, it might not be the most efficient way of doing things, but here's the
deal: `“Diving into the messy stuff pays off big time. Founders learn directly
from the source, creating better products because they understand what
customers need.”`

They experience the challenges firsthand, unlike big companies shielded by
layers of managers."

So, if you want to be a founder, get ready for the not-so-pretty, unglamorous
work. It's the secret ingredient to learning, building, and serving customers
the right way. Embrace the tough parts, founders – that's how the magic
happens.

You might be thinking that, if I do such work while building a startup, **your
friends and family will make fun of you -**

And It sounds tough dealing with friends making fun of your startup,
especially when they work at a comfy tech giant like Google. It's easy to feel
insecure comparing your hand-delivered food runs to their free laundry and
Google buses. But here's the thing:

> “Building a company is like climbing a gnarly mountain. Google might be a
> fancy ski resort, but it's not the peak. The climb's brutal, full of sweat,
> scrapes, and maybe even some puking. Most folks take one look at that
> mountain and say, "Nope, I'll stick to the slopes, thanks." That's why there
> aren't more Googles in the world.

The early startup grind weeds out most people. **It's hard, risky, and often
thankless.** You're saying, "I'll trade comfort and stability for a shot at
something big, even if I face failure." That's not for everyone, and that's
okay.

**So, when your friends poke fun, remember this:**

> they're not on the same climb. They're chilling on a different mountain with
> its own set of challenges. You're on a different path, one that's way less
> crowded and potentially way more rewarding.

Instead of feeling insecure, own your hustle. Be proud you're taking the hard
road, the one less travelled. Tell your friends, "Yeah, I'm hand-delivering
food and adding links myself, but I'm building something I believe in. This
might suck now, but the view from the top will be epic."

Focus on your journey, not their vacation. Celebrate your milestones, big and
small. And remember, the world needs more scrappy climbers, not just comfy
skiers. So keep hustling, keep grinding, and keep your eyes on the prize.
That's the real flex.

P.S. And who knows, maybe one day you'll be offering your friends free
laundry/perks like Google at your own startup HQ.”

##### **FEATURED POST**

When talking to investors, you’re answering the what (product), why (mission),
where (if relevant) and how (strategy and go-to-market).

But founders often ignore another important question: Why now? Why wouldn’t it
have been possible to have built the company five years ago? Why would five
years from now be too late?

The answer is often related to something that is shifting and changing, either
in the market or with the technology layer.

Successful companies usually have these things in common: They were the right
company, solving the right problem at the right time..… **[Read More
