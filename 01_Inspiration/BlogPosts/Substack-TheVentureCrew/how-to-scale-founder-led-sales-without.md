👋 Hey — it’s [Sahil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahilsr/), this time together
with
[Clarify](https://www.clarify.ai?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=venture_curator&utm_campaign=placement)!

Welcome back to Venture Curator, where we explore how top investors think, how
real founders build, and the strategies shaping tomorrow’s companies.
* * *

A few months ago, I started paying closer attention to something I’d always
brushed off: As an early-stage founder, the moment your sales motion starts
working is often the moment it starts breaking you.

You finally figure out how to sell. And just when things are starting to
click, you start to burn out.

It turns out, once you’ve hacked together your first few deals, the real
bottleneck isn’t tactics. It’s your own bandwidth.

Founder-led sales start out energising. Then it starts stealing energy. And
the pattern is almost universal.

You're the founder. You have to lead sales.

You're the one who knows the product, the story, the pitch. But you're also
the one fixing bugs, reviewing wireframes, updating investor decks, onboarding
new hires and now somehow remembering every follow-up email, taking detailed
call notes, and figuring out why a promising lead ghosted you two weeks ago.

Context switching alone can compromise your clarity.

There’s one thing I’ve realised: the earlier you treat founder-led sales like
a system, not a scramble, the longer you last. And increasingly, I think every
founder needs a co-pilot in the process. More on that soon.

Selling your own product feels like a rite of passage. It’s where you learn
the objections, sharpen your pitch, and build memory for what actually gets
someone to say yes.

That learning curve is the whole point; you need to own those conversations
before you ever think about hiring someone else to run them. But the system
you build in that stage matters just as much as the sales you close, because
one day you’ll need to hand it to your first sales hire.

You start off proud that you're doing it yourself.

But over time, what was once energizing starts becoming a source of drag.

Because founder-led sales isn’t just about the call, it’s about everything
before and after it:

  * **The prep:** reading up on the prospect, hunting through your inbox, scraping LinkedIn

  * **The call itself:** trying to listen, pitch, qualify, and take notes all at once

  * **The follow-up:** summarizing the conversation, writing a custom email, updating your CRM

  * **The loop:** checking back in, remembering next steps, digging through old notes that may or may not exist

One study found that sales reps only spend **33% of their time actually
selling**. The rest? Admin. Follow-ups. CRM updates. Busywork.

Now imagine how that looks for a founder juggling five jobs.

And here's what creeps in:

  * You forget to follow up on a great call

  * You mix up details between two leads

  * You leave notes half-written

  * You hit Thursday and can't remember what happened on Monday

What I've seen is that most founders don't quit founder-led sales. Things just
start to slip as volume and intensity increase: they are distracted on calls,
late on follow-ups, skipping steps of their process. That's when burnout and
frustration can sneak in.

Founders often say: “I feel like I’m missing things. I’m dropping balls, and I
don’t even know which ones.”

It’s not always because you’re doing too much. It’s because your system is too
fragile.

And if you plan to hand sales to someone else eventually, a fragile system
means they’ll be starting from scratch — losing all the hard-won knowledge you
built selling it yourself.

Sticky notes. Notion. Calendar comments. Stray Gmail drafts. It works… until
it really doesn’t.

I’ve seen countless founders rely on Notion templates and traditional CRM
tools. I've used many myself. But
[Clarify’s](https://www.clarify.ai?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=venture_curator&utm_campaign=placement)
autonomous approach genuinely stands apart.

That’s why the best time to capture your process isn’t after you hire a rep —
it’s while you’re still in the trenches, learning exactly what works.

**[Clarify](https://www.clarify.ai?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=venture_curator&utm_campaign=placement)
is designed as a full-stack co-pilot for founder-led sales.** It embeds itself
into your workflow from the first touchpoint to the final follow-up and
handles everything in between with almost zero manual input.

Here’s what that looks like in practice, grouped by outcomes:

**Before the call**

  * [Clarify](https://www.clarify.ai?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=venture_curator&utm_campaign=placement) enriches contact profiles with job titles, LinkedIn, company info, and context from previous conversations, so you’re never scrambling through tabs before a meeting.

**During the call**

  * It listens silently, tracks the conversation, and captures key details like objections, pricing discussions, goals, and next steps freeing you to stay focused on the human side of selling.

**After the call**

  * [Clarify](https://www.clarify.ai?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=venture_curator&utm_campaign=placement) generates a tailored summary, logs structured call notes into your CRM, updates your pipeline in real-time, and even drafts a ready-to-send follow-up email.

Each of these touchpoints is designed to remove friction, not just save time.

Take Lucy Wang, co-founder of Pocketflows. She [was
spending](https://www.clarify.ai/customers/pocketflows) 1–2 hours a day
updating spreadsheets and chasing follow-ups. After adopting Clarify, she
reclaimed that time and gained clarity over her funnel.

She described the tool as "an extension of my brain" not because it was
flashy, but because it reduced the number of things she had to remember.

Or look at Pranav Piyush at Paramark, who [replaced Salesforce with
Clarify](https://www.clarify.ai/customers/paramark). The decision wasn’t about
aesthetics; it was operational. Clarify cut their CRM-related admin time from
**5 hours a week to under 1 hour**. Their deal execution velocity increased
substantially, with fewer dropped handoffs and better pipeline visibility.

And that’s what matters: results with less mental wear.

If you’re in the thick of founder-led sales,
[Clarify](https://www.clarify.ai?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=venture_curator&utm_campaign=placement)
won’t just help you feel the shift. [Try it for a

and see what it’s like when your sales system runs itself.
