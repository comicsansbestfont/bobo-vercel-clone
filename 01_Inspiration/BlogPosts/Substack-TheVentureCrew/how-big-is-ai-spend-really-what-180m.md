##### **FROM OUR PARTNER - ROCKET**

We’ve tested every major AI builder. They all share the same fundamental flaw:
they make you adapt to AI instead of AI adapting to you.

You learn prompt engineering. You write carefully. You retry constantly. You
debug AI mistakes. That’s not building. That’s negotiating.

[Rocket’s](https://www.rocket.new/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=venturecurator&utm_campaign=13thnov)
Precision Mode eliminates this entirely. Over 100 structured commands that
execute exactly what you specify. “Fix mobile layout” repairs responsive
issues. “Add Stripe integration” builds payment flows. “Optimize images”
compresses and converts. “Update pricing table” modifies content.

No interpretation. No guessing. No retries. Just precise execution. This is
what professional AI building looks like.

##### **START WITH**

Fresh [analysis](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tomasztunguz_just-how-much-
are-we-spending-on-ai-compared-activity-7392344771450765312-1rUc) comparing AI
infrastructure investment to the largest capital mobilisations in U.S. history
shows just how fast the AI economy is scaling and how far it still has to go.

World War II remains the biggest economic mobilisation ever at 37.8% of GDP,
followed by WWI (12.3%), the New Deal (7.7%), and the railroad boom (6.0%).  
AI infra spend is already at 1.6% of GDP — bigger than the entire telecom
bubble at its peak (1.2%).

If OpenAI represents ~30% of total AI infra spend, the market would hit $983B
annually by 2030, roughly 2.8% of U.S. GDP.

Hitting the railroad era’s 6% equivalent would require ~$2.1T per year,
meaning today’s tech giants would need to 5–7x their current spend.

AI infra spending has already become one of America’s largest investment
categories, and it’s only in the early innings.

While still far from the scale of wartime mobilisation, the compounding CAPEX
cycle from OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Meta could reshape the U.S. economic
landscape for the next decade.

Yoram Wijngaarde’s[ latest
analysis](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yoramdw_in-my-last-few-posts-ive-
shown-a-clear-activity-7391072261031530497-EiFx) shows that European startups
still face a 12% valuation discount compared to U.S. peers at the Series A
stage. The gap reflects a persistent cost and capital availability imbalance
in early-stage venture rounds.

  * **12% early-stage discount:** European Series A valuations remain roughly 12% lower than U.S. equivalents, underscoring how geography still shapes pricing in early venture deals.

  * **Parity at $100M+ valuations:** Once startups cross the $100M pre-money threshold, the gap nearly disappears — with European unicorns often priced on par with U.S. counterparts.

  * **U.S. still dominates deal flow:** Despite convergence at the top, U.S. founders capture larger and more frequent rounds, maintaining a structural edge in access to late-stage capital.

Europe’s venture ecosystem is maturing fast, but scale is the great equaliser;
the valuation gap narrows only once startups break out of the early-stage
orbit.

PitchBook’s new [Q3 2025 US VC Valuations & Returns
Report](https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q3-2025-us-vc-valuations-and-
returns-report) captures one of the most uncomfortable contradictions in the
market right now: Startup valuations look like 2021, but VC returns look like
2010.

Here’s what matters:

Across every stage, the median pre-money valuation is now equal to or above
2021 levels.

AI dealmaking is the biggest accelerant, but there’s a second driver: multi-
stage funds are pushing aggressively into seed and Series A, bidding up prices
with looser valuation discipline.

Median seed pre-money valuation in Q3 2025: $13.9M, a new all-time high.

Despite rising valuations, VC’s rolling 1-year IRR is only 3.1%, and cash
flows to LPs have been negative since 2022.

The 2020 VC vintage now has the worst TVPI after 5 years of any vintage since
2010, showing how badly late-cycle checks are struggling.

More unicorns have gone public in 2025 than in the prior few years, but the
overall IPO count will still only match the last three years. Large-scale M&A
hasn’t meaningfully rebounded either, leaving many funds dependent on 2026
outcomes to avoid prolonged underperformance.

Dealmaking is climbing, and AI startup costs are dropping, letting founders
justify richer terms. The market is effectively betting that liquidity catches
up later — a narrative that has not yet materialised, but investors are hoping
2026 cracks open the exit window.

**The bottom line:**

VC is facing another valuation/returns disconnect. Prices are rising again,
but distributions aren’t. Unless liquidity accelerates in 2026, many funds —
especially those raised in the 2020–2022 boom years — will face steep pressure
from LPs expecting real returns, not just paper markups.

##### **SOMETHING MORE**

Most founders think great VCs win because they have money, brand, or a famous
GP. [David Booth’s insight](https://a16z.com/joining-a16z-david-booth/) is
sharper: the next decade of VC will be dominated by firms that operate like
network platforms, not service providers.

And this matters because the VC you choose directly affects how fast your
startup compounds.

**Why traditional VC hits a ceiling**

The old model is intimacy-driven: partner time, partner intros, partner
advice. But that model collapses at scale. Every new investment dilutes
attention. Founders feel it immediately: fewer intros, slower help, weaker
leverage.

This is why VC historically does not behave like a network-effect business.

**The shift: preferential attachment**

Marc Andreessen calls it the core mechanic of startup success: when you’re
winning, everything starts attaching to you, talent, customers, capital,
media, momentum.

VC firms themselves can harness the same mechanism. The ones that build
systems, not just relationships, start compounding.

**What a “network-effect VC” actually looks like**

Not events. Not fancy platform decks. Not “value-add” slogans. A real
networked VC looks like this:

A firm with these layers doesn’t add value linearly; it compounds with every
new founder who joins.

**What a16z got right (and others are now trying to copy)**

They built the “pit crew” behind the GP. Yes, the partner wins the deal. Yes,
the partner advises you at critical moments.

But the actual advantage comes from the invisible infrastructure:

  * talent pipelines continuously flowing into portfolio companies

  * customers and execs moving between companies

  * alumni founders becoming angels for new founders

  * internal tools, research, and distribution that everyone can access

  * vertical GPs + horizontal networks that multiply over time

This turns a VC firm from “GP attention divided across 40 companies” into: “A
system where each company makes the next one stronger.”

**Why does this matter when choosing your investor**

Founders often focus on: Which GP is nice?, Who has the biggest brand?, Who
writes the fastest check?

The better question is: Which firm gives me access to a network that
compounds?

Look for signals like:

  * Do portfolio founders collaborate or live in silos?

  * Does talent circulate within the network naturally?

  * Is there real customer flow, or just promises?

  * Does joining this firm instantly increase your surface area of luck?

Because at seed and Series A, you don’t need capital, you need acceleration.

For founders: You’re not just raising money. You’re plugging into an operating
system. A traditional VC gives you credibility. A network-effect VC gives you
momentum, which is far more valuable.

ICONIQ Capital just [released](https://cdn.prod.website-
files.com/65d0d38fc4ec8ce8a8921654/685c2138c9c86b5662e523f3_ICONIQ%20Analytics_Insights%20_The_State_of_GTM_in_2025.pdf)
new GTM data, and the takeaway is simple: growth isn’t broken; the motions
powering growth have changed. The companies pulling ahead aren’t selling
harder. They’re rebuilding GTM around AI, faster adoption, and smarter
pricing.

Most founders still focus on top-of-funnel. ICONIQ’s data shows the real
bottleneck is now late-stage conversion and post-sales execution. That’s where
AI-native companies are opening a huge gap.

**Growth is returning, but only for teams that rebuilt the funnel**

ARR growth has been flat since 2023, but companies between $25M–$200M ARR are
finally reaccelerating. The difference is how quickly they turn trials and
POCs into paid deals.

AI-native companies are converting nearly twice as well in this stage because
they prove ROI faster.

Practical signals:

  * Free-trial/POC conversion at $100M+ ARR: 56% for AI-native vs 32% for others

  * Top-quartile growth (for $25M–$100M ARR): up from 78% → 93%

  * Quota attainment is flat, meaning the market hasn’t fully recovered — but conversion winners are still growing

**The new GTM structure: more post-sales, fewer “classic” sales roles**

ICONIQ found something important: the fastest-growing companies now look more
like “adoption machines” than traditional sales orgs.

AI-native teams are shifting headcount toward:

Why? Because if adoption is slow, revenue is slow. If adoption is fast,
revenue compounds.

What founders should do:

  * If your product requires behaviour change, post-sales is now a growth function, not a support function

  * Forward-deployed engineers shorten time-to-value → meaning they directly increase revenue

  * Don’t scale AEs faster than you scale adoption capacity

**Pricing is changing: hybrid models are becoming the norm**

ICONIQ shows nearly one-third of companies now use hybrid pricing — especially
AI-native ones. Pure subscription is becoming risky because AI cost-to-serve
is unpredictable.

What’s working:

  * Platform fee + usage

  * Seat + consumption

  * Commit + overage

Hybrid pricing protects margin, aligns with customer value, and lets you scale
AI without burning cash.

**AI implementation: real efficiency only shows up when it’s deep in the
workflow**

Seventy percent of companies have moderate or full AI adoption, but the
winners go deeper than lead gen or content automation.

High-performers use AI for:

  * Qualification and forecasting

  * Meeting intelligence and objection analysis

  * Research and enrichment

  * Faster onboarding and enablement

Result: leaner teams, faster cycles, higher conversion.

What founders often get wrong:

  * AI only helps if it replaces steps, not adds steps

  * Tool sprawl kills efficiency gains

  * Rollout fails when reps don’t trust the AI outputs

Focus on one: AI that removes work, not AI that creates new dashboards.

**ICONIQ’s data points to three non-negotiable shifts:**

  1. Fix late-stage conversion before you pour money into the pipeline.

  2. Shift headcount toward adoption: post-sales + forward-deployed engineering.

  3. Move to hybrid pricing early to protect margin as AI usage scales.

Founders who rebuild GTM around these moves are already outperforming.
Everyone else is trying to force 2019 playbooks into a 2025 market.

Airtree shared a [solid open-source SHA
template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/191rda1jCbm2Wl5Sltlj8O56VYDQ7WfeIesNnE2NEBsE/edit),
but most early founders still underestimate what the SHA controls. This isn’t
a legal formality; it’s the document that decides who has power, who gets
diluted, and who wins disagreements inside your company.

Here’s the compact founder-focused version.

**What the SHA really does**

A SHA is the private rulebook for how your startup runs. Your default
constitution is generic; the SHA lets you define how decisions actually
happen, who votes, who controls the board, how shares move, and how conflicts
get resolved.

**Board control and decision-making**

Early teams blur the lines between founders and board, but once investors come
in, the SHA locks that structure. A few things it typically settles:

Get this wrong and you can lose control long before Series A.

**Who decides what**

Founders often assume they can make most decisions themselves. The SHA decides
otherwise.

Generally:

  * Shareholders vote on big structural matters (remove directors, amend the constitution, wind up the company)

  * The board handles hiring, budgets, financing, issuing shares, and approving a sale

Some investors also ask for specific veto rights. Understand every veto before
you sign; one line can change the power dynamic for years.

**Voting thresholds**

This is where many founders sleepwalk into giving minority investors blocking
power.

Common thresholds:

The fewer decisions that require 75% or 100%, the safer you are.

  * **Share rules that matter most -** Most real conflicts happen around new funding, exits, or someone selling shares. Three clauses determine how that plays out:

  * **Pre-emptive rights -** Existing shareholders get first right to buy new shares or buy a selling shareholder’s shares. This protects everyone from unexpected dilution, but it also slows down deals if written poorly.

  * **Drag-along rights -** If the majority wants to sell the company, the minority can be forced to sell too. It keeps an acquisition clean. The key thing for founders:  
check the drag threshold. If it’s too low, you can be forced into a sale you
don’t want.

  * **Tag-along rights -** If majority shareholders sell, minority shareholders can join and sell on the same terms. This stops control from shifting to a stranger without everyone being protected.

**Handling disputes**

Good SHAs try to prevent legal battles from exploding. Usually, the process is
simple:

  1. founders + shareholders try to negotiate

  2. If that fails, a neutral mediator steps in

  3. Only after that can anyone take legal action

This saves time, money, and relationships.

AI didn’t destroy the job market in 2025; it reshaped which parts of each job
matter.

Henley Chiu [analysed](https://bloomberry.com/blog/i-analyzed-180m-jobs-to-
see-what-jobs-ai-is-actually-replacing-today/) 180M job postings, the pattern
is clear: roles built on execution fall, roles built on judgment and strategy
hold, and AI-infrastructure roles explode.

**The biggest drops came from creative execution roles.**

Computer graphic artists, photographers, and writers are down 25–33%. These
are the jobs where AI can now produce “good enough” output instantly. But the
creative roles that involve taste, decision-making, client navigation, and
strategy are holding steady, with creative directors, designers, and PM-led
creative work.

The same split appears everywhere: AI compresses the bottom of the ladder but
pulls the top upward.

**Other declines have nothing to do with AI.**

Corporate compliance, ESG, and sustainability roles fell 25–35% because the
regulatory climate shifted. When the government stops enforcing rules,
companies stop staffing for them. Sometimes AI isn’t the culprit, politics is.

**Medical scribes may be an early real AI displacement story.**

Scribe postings fell 20%, while medical coders and assistants stayed flat.
With AI tools that automatically generate clinical notes from doctor–patient
conversations, documentation-heavy roles are becoming vulnerable. It’s not
conclusive yet — but the trend is worth watching.

The biggest growth is in the AI infrastructure stack:

  * Machine Learning Engineers: +40% (fastest-growing job title)

  * Robotics engineers: +11%

  * Research scientists: +11%

  * Data centre engineers: +9%

AI isn’t replacing tech jobs; it’s creating a whole new supply chain around
training, running, and scaling models.

**Leadership hiring stayed surprisingly strong.**

Overall, job postings dropped 8%, but directors, VPs, and C-suite roles
dropped only ~2%. Middle managers fell more, and IC roles fell the most.
Senior leaders who can use AI to prototype ideas, validate technical
decisions, or run analysis simply need fewer layers under them.

**Marketing split in two.**

Influencer marketers grew 18% — one of the few bright spots. With AI flooding
the internet with generic content, people trust creators more than brands.
Traditional marketing roles stayed flat or dipped slightly.

**Engineering jobs were far more resilient than the hype suggested.**

Most engineering roles were flat or growing. AI coding tools are amplifying
engineers, not replacing them. The one soft spot: frontend roles — likely
because no-code/AI builders now handle simple UI work extremely well.

**Customer support survived the AI wave.**

Customer service reps dropped just 4%, far better than expected. Companies
tried replacing support with AI… and quickly realized angry customers don’t
like arguing with bots. Human empathy still wins.

**Sales roles were mixed, but one role surged: Director of Revenue (+10%).**

Companies want people who understand **pricing, churn, expansion, PLG** , and
how AI changes the revenue engine. And behind the scenes, a new role — “GTM
engineer” — grew more than 200% (small base), driven by AI-powered ops work.

The pattern across all categories is the same.

  * AI kills repetitive execution.

  * AI boosts people who make decisions.

  * And AI creates entirely new industries around itself.
