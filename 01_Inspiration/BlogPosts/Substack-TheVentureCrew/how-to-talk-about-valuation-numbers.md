**Invest In The Company That Won Over The Dragons💡**

➡️ Smart-doorbell pioneer, **RING** , pitched on the hit show **Shark Tank**
at a valuation of just **$7 million** — the sharks shut them down.

**5 years later** , t**he company sold to Amazon for more than** **$1
Billion**. Turning the 10% stake initially offered to the sharks from $700K
into $100M!

[A similar story is
brewing](https://invest.helloryse.com/?tnames=vcnl,11-06-2023) in the Smart
Shades segment of the industry, with a company called[
RYSE](https://invest.helloryse.com/?tnames=vcnl,11-06-2023) pitching on the
Canadian version of Shark Tank called **Dragon’s Den**.

**The difference?**[ They received two
offers](https://invest.helloryse.com/?tnames=vcnl,11-06-2023) and have an
addressable market that could be significantly larger than that of Rings!

One of the hardest things about the fund-raising process for entrepreneurs is
that you’re trying to raise money from **people who have “asymmetric
information.”** VC firms see thousands of deals and have a refined sense of
how the market is valuing deals because they get price signals across all of
these deals.

`As an entrepreneur, it can feel as intimidating as going to buy a car where
the dealer knows the price of every make & model of a car and you’re guessing
at how much to pay.`

Last Saturday (the day before yesterday), I had a brief call with a **venture
capitalist (called Investor-A for privacy reasons)** who has over 7 years of
experience in the VC. We discussed how founders can approach the topic of
valuation at a startup and how investors typically perceive valuation. So I
thought to share the brief about the conversation.

Of course, unlike cars, there is no direct comparison across each startup so
these are just some general guidelines to try and even the information field.
So, grab your coffee and let’s deep dive into it.

It is not uncommon for a VC to ask about your price expectations in this
fundraising process. It’s a legitimate question as the VC is in “price
discovery” mode and wants a sense of whether you’re in his or her valuation
range.

It’s a tough dance but, here is what Investors-A generally suggest:

  * In most cases don’t name an actual price

  * Your job is to “anchor” by giving the VC a general range without saying it. Call this “price signalling.”

  * Turn the tables on the VC by politely saying, “Given you must have a sense of our general valuation, how do you feel the market is pricing rounds like ours these days? After all — we only raise once every 1–2 years!”

Why shouldn’t most founders just name a price? For starters, it’s the job of
the “buyer” to name a price and you don’t want to name your valuation if it
ends up being lower than the VC would have paid or a price too high that the
VC simply pulls out of the process.

**So then why anchor?** If you don’t give signals to a VC of what your general
expectations are it’s hard for them to know whether you have realistic
expectations relative to their perceived value of you and whether you want to
keep them in the process rather than just having them pull out based on what
they THINK you might want on valuation.

> Any great negotiation starts by anchoring the other party’s expectations and
> then testing their reaction.

How you talk about valuation will of course depend on how well your business
is performing and how much demand you have from other investors. If I leave
out the immediate “up and to the right” companies and talk about most others
who have made good progress since the last funding but the next round isn’t a
slam dunk, **you might consider something like if asked about your
expectations:**

  * We closed our last round at a $17 million post-money valuation and we had raised $3.5 million.

  * We closed it 20 months ago and we feel like we’ve made great progress

  * We’re hoping to raise $5–7 million in this round

  * We know roughly how VCs price rounds and we think we’ll likely be within the normal range of expectations

  * But obviously, we’re going to let the market tell us what the right valuation is. We only raise every 2 years so the market will have a better feel for it than we will

  * We’re optimizing for the best long-term fit for a VC and who we think will help us create the most value. We’re not optimizing for the highest price. But obviously, we want a fair price.

  * How do you generally think about valuation for a company at our stage? (this is seeking feedback / testing your response)

Here you’ve set a bunch of signals without naming your price. What a VC heard
was:

  * The price has to be higher than $17 million, which was the last round. It was 20 months ago and the founder told me she has made great progress (code words for the higher price expected)

  * She is raising $5–7 million and knows the range of valuations for this amount. If I assume 20–25% dilution that implies a price of between $20–28 million pre-money valuation ($25-$35m post-money). Maybe she wants slightly higher but she certainly won’t want lower.

  * She has told me she’s not trying to shop this for the highest price. I’m not so naive as to completely believe that — every entrepreneur will go for the highest reasonable price with a VC they like so I at least need to put my best foot forward. But if I’m in the ballpark of fair she won’t game me and push for the highest price as the _only_ part of her decision.

It’s not uncommon for a VC to ask you how much capital you’ve raised and what
the post-money valuation was on your last round.  

I know that some founders feel uncomfortable with this as though they might
somehow be sharing something so confidential that it ultimately hurts you.
These are straightforward questions, the answers will have no bearing on your
ultimate success and if you want to know the truth most VCs have access to
databases like Pitchbook that have all of this information anyway.

**So Why Does A VC Ask You?**

**In the first place, they’re looking for “fit” with their firm.** If you’re
talking with a typical Seed/A/B round firm they often have ownership targets
in the company in which they invest. Since they have limited capital and
limited time availability they often try to make concentrated investments
across companies in which they have the highest conviction.

If a firm typically invests $5 million in its first check and its target is to
own 20% or more that means that most of its deals are in the $15–20 million
pre-money range. If you’re raising at $40 million pre then you might be out of
their strike zone.

Many VCs will have a distribution curve where they’ll do a small number of
early-stage deals (say $1.5–3 million invested at a $6–10m pre-money), a
larger number of “down the fairway” deals ($4–5 million at a $15–25 million
pre) and a few later-stage deals (say $8–10 million at a $30–40 million pre).

Of course, there are smaller funds that are more price sensitive and want to
invest earlier and later stage funds with more capital to deploy and write
larger checks a higher prices so understanding what is that VC’s “norm” is
important.

**A second thing a VC may be trying to determine is whether your last-round
valuation was significantly over-priced.** Of course, valuation is in the eye
of the beholder but if that VC thinks your last round valuation was way too
high then he or she is **more likely to politely pass rather than try and talk
down your valuation now.**

**VCs hate “down rounds” and many don’t even like “flat rounds.”** There are
some simple reasons. For starters, VCs don’t like to piss off a bunch of your
previous-round VCs because they’ll likely have to work with them in other
deals. They also don’t want to become a shareholder in a company where every
other shareholder starts by being annoyed with them.

But there is also another very rational reason. If a VC prices a flat or down
round it means that management teams are often taking too much dilution. Every
VC knows that talented founders or executives who don’t own enough of the
company or perceive they will have enough upside will eventually start
thinking about their next company and are less likely to stick around. So a VC
doesn’t want to price a deal in which the founder feels aggrieved from day one
but takes your money anyway because he or she doesn’t have a choice.

Every VC has a story where they did the flat round anyway and the founder
said, “I don’t mind! I know our last round valuation was too high.” In nearly
100% of those cases, the founder expresses his or her frustration a year later
(and 2 years later and 4 years later). The memory isn’t “Boy, you stepped in
at a time when we were having a tough time getting other VCs to see the value
in our company — thank you!” it is more likely a softer version of “You took
advantage of us when we had no other options.”

It is this muscle memory that makes the VC want to pass on the next down or
flat round. In a market where there is always another great deal to evaluate,
why sign up for one where you know there are going to be bruised egos from the
get-go?

**The “How much have you raised?” question is usually a VC trying to determine
whether you’ve been capital efficient with the funds you’ve raised to date.**
If you’ve raised large amounts of money and can’t show much progress you’ve
got a tougher time to explain the past than if you’ve been frugal and over-
achieved.

**Investor’s advice to founders** on the questions of “How much did you raise
in the last round?” and “What was the post-money valuation of your last
round?” -  
is to start with just the data. If you don’t perceive that you have any
potential “issues” (raised too much, price too high) then this should be a
non-event. If you are aware you may have some issues or if you are constantly
getting feedback that you may have issues then it’s a smart strategy for you
to develop a set of talking points to get in front of the issue when asked.

This is a delicate dance as well. Each new investor knows that the people who
have the MOST asymmetric information on your performance are the previous
round investors. They not only know all of your data and how you’re doing
relative to the competition, but they also have a good view of how well your
management team is performing together and whether you’re a good leader.

On the one hand, a new potential investor will **want to know that your
existing investors are willing to continue to invest heavily in this round**
and at the same price that they are paying, on the other hand, they want to
invest enough of the round to hit their ownership targets and may not want
existing investors to take their full pro-rata investments.

Before raising capital you need to have a conversation with your existing
investors to get a sense of what they’re thinking or at a minimum you better
have an intuitive feel for it. Assuming that most of your existing investors
are supportive but want a new outside lead, **Investor-A recommends answering
this something like this:**

  * Our existing investors of course want to participate in this round. They will likely want to do their pro rata investments — some might even want slightly more.

  * I know that new firms have ownership targets. I feel confident I can meet these. If it becomes sensitive between a new investor’s needs and previous investors — I’m not going to tell my investors they can’t participate but I feel confident I can work with them to keep the sizes of their checks reasonable.

What a VC hears when you say this:

  * My existing investors are supportive. I will eventually call them anyway to confirm but I can continue my investment assuming they are supportive

  * In the future, if we raise a larger round this entrepreneur won’t try to screw me by forcing me not to take my pro rata rights because they weren’t throwing existing investors under the bus with me

  * This entrepreneur is sophisticated enough to know that fund-raising is a dance in which I need to meet the needs of both new investors and previous investors. They will work with me so I can get close to my ownership targets.

There are some types of rounds where just naming price might be a better
option.

  1. **Strategics**(ie industry investors vs. VCs). For some reason, many strategic investors don’t like to lead rounds and they don’t like to name a price. This isn’t true of all strategics but it is true for many of them — particularly those who don’t have a long history in VC. Having a price helps them to evaluate the deal better. Often they’re much better at a “yes/no” decision than naming a price. If you name your valuation you sometimes have to give them a rationale on how similar companies are valued so they can justify their internal case. Knowing that other institutional investors (including your insiders) are paying the same price as them in this round helps.

  2. **Many investors.** When you are raising for 8–10 new sources vs. 1–2 sometimes it’s easier just to name price. One reason you might be raising from so many sources is that you haven’t found it easy to find a strong lead investor (for say $20 million) but many sources are willing to write you smaller checks (of say $2–3 million each). Many investors can also be in the opposite situation where you’re so successful that everybody wants to invest. In either case, having a price target can help you get momentum.

Final point. If done in the right way, each VC meeting can be a great
opportunity for you to get feedback on how investors are seeing market
valuations in the time that you’re raising (valuations change based on the
overall funding economy) and also a chance to hear about how the VCs think
about your valuation and/or let you know whether or not you have any perceived
problems.

**You might politely ask questions like:**

  * Does your firm have a target ownership range?

  * Do you typically like to lead and do you ever follow?

  * Are there firms you like to co-invest with?

  * Does our fundraising size sound reasonable to you?

  * Are there any valuation concerns you might have that we can address now?

Your goal in forming questions is to get signalling back from the VC. Remember
that fund-raising is a two-way process and you have every right to ask
questions that help orient you just as a good VC will ask questions of you.
