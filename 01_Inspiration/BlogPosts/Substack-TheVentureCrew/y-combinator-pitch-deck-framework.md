##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

Building a pitch deck for your seed round is a crucial step in your startup
journey. It’s not just about putting slides together—it’s about crafting a
story that resonates with investors and gets them genuinely excited about your
vision.

While there are plenty of guides online about building pitch decks, most of
them fall short of offering clear, actionable advice. That’s why I’ve taken
the time to dive deep into Y Combinator’s resources, watch hours of their
videos, and analyze detailed articles to create this comprehensive and
practical guide for you.

Your pitch deck should achieve two things:

For seed-stage startups, this often means focusing on simplicity and narrative
clarity. Remember, at this stage, most startups don’t have extensive data or
years of history to share—and that’s perfectly fine. Your goal is to make your
story as compelling and concise as possible.

Creating a pitch deck doesn’t have to be overly complicated. It’s all about
telling a clear, concise, and compelling story that investors can follow
easily. Here’s how you can structure your deck:

**Title Slide**

Start strong with a title slide that sets the tone for your pitch. It should
include:

Keep it simple and professional. This is your first impression, so make it
count.

This is where you lay out the real-world issue your startup is solving. A
well-defined problem statement is crucial for connecting with your audience.

  * Focus on the impact of the problem on real people or businesses.

  * Use a statistic, example, or story to make it relatable.

Avoid overloading this slide with too much text or technical jargon. The
problem should be clear and easy to understand.

Next, explain how your product or service solves the problem you’ve just
described. This is your chance to show why your approach is unique and
valuable.

  * Keep your explanation brief and to the point.

  * Highlight the concrete benefits of your solution.

  * If needed, use visuals or diagrams, but avoid cluttering the slide.

Investors love to see traction—it’s proof that your startup is making
progress. Even if your numbers are early, show them off in a way that’s easy
to understand.

  * Use a chart or graph to showcase key metrics like revenue or user growth.

  * Add context to explain why these metrics are important.

  * Keep it honest and straightforward. Smooth growth curves are rare, and that’s okay.

What makes your startup special? Use this slide to highlight what sets you
apart from competitors.

  * Focus on your unique insights, technology, or approach.

  * Keep it concise and avoid unnecessary technical details.

Your business model is all about showing how you make money. While it doesn’t
have to be perfect, it should be clear enough for investors to understand.

  * Explain your revenue streams and pricing strategy.

  * If you have any early results, include them here.

  * Break complex models into simpler components if needed.

Investors need to see the potential for scale. Use this slide to showcase the
size of your market and the opportunity you’re addressing.

  * Provide a high-level overview of your Total Addressable Market (TAM).

  * Use a clean, visual representation to convey scale.

A compelling market opportunity slide gives investors confidence in your
startup’s long-term potential.

Your team is one of the most critical factors for early-stage investors. Use
this slide to show why your team is uniquely qualified to solve the problem.

Wrap up your pitch with a clear “ask.” Be specific about what you need and
what investors can expect in return.

  * State the amount you’re raising.

  * Explain how the funds will be used (e.g., product development, hiring, marketing).

  * Outline where you expect to be within a year and how this funding helps you get there.

Remember — even the best content can fall flat if your slides aren’t designed
effectively. You might be wondering how startups that raised millions of
dollars build and design their pitch decks.

That’s why we’ve curated 40+ real slides from startups that secured funding
from Y Combinator and leading VCs. Here are a few examples:

  * **Maikbou** – Raised $3.3M (Seed round)

  * **Pathrise** – Raised $3M (Seed round)

  * **Lago** – Raised $22M (Seed round)

  * **Apriora** – Raised $2.8M (Seed round)

  * **Careerist** – Raised $8M (Series A)

  * **Vori** – Raised $45M (Series A)

  * **Rippling** – Raised $145M (Series B)

  * **Thunkable** – Raised $30M (Series B)

  * **Pelago** – Raised $58M (Series C)

We’ve also built multiple guides and frameworks that can be helpful to early-
stage founders:

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Too often, we glamorize the moment of inspiration — the mythical spark that
launches a billion-dollar startup. But behind the scenes, most successful
founders don’t stumble into great ideas. They hunt for them with intention,
pattern recognition, and repeatable frameworks.

If you’re a founder in the “what should I build next?” phase, this is the time
that matters most. Direction, at this stage, is everything. A slightly better
idea today can compound into an exponentially better outcome tomorrow.

Below are five powerful mental models to stress-test and refine your startup
idea before you build shared by NFX fund:

**Framework 1: Innovate Just Enough**

Going all-in on something radically new might sound visionary — but novelty is
a double-edged sword. Too little, and you're indistinguishable. Too much, and
you're unrelatable.

Borrow a tactic from the gaming industry: when launching a new game, change
just one of three elements:

  * Platform (e.g., PC, mobile, VR)

  * Core mechanic (e.g., first-person shooter, match-3, simulation)

  * Theme (e.g., pirates, vampires, outer space)

This principle applies beyond games. A startup idea with one meaningful twist
on a familiar pattern often resonates more deeply and grows faster than
something unrecognizably novel.

> Tweak one major lever. Don’t reinvent all three.

**Framework 2: Ride the Tech Wave**

Startups that align with recent technological shifts have an unfair advantage.
It’s not just about solving a problem — it’s about timing.

Ask yourself: what’s newly possible because of tech advancements in the last
3–36 months?

Examples:

  * Smartphones → Uber: Real-time geolocation and payment made ride-hailing obvious.

  * APIs → Wealthfront: What used to require a private banker can now be done with software.

  * Broadband → YouTube: Suddenly, streaming video to the masses was viable.

> Look for new behaviors unlocked by recent tech, not just underserved needs.

**Framework 3: Be Contrarian (and Right)**

Breakout ideas often look like bad ideas at first. Why? Because if they were
obviously great, everyone would be building them.

This concept — non-consensus truths — separates visionaries from the crowd.
Think about Airbnb (strangers sleeping in your home?) or even early Twitter
(microblogging in 140 characters?).

The early reactions might include eye-rolls, but that’s often where the white
space lies.

> If your idea doesn’t sound slightly weird, it might already be too late.

**Framework 4: Problem-Solving vs. Opportunity-Creating**

Not every great startup begins with a “pain point.” Some ideas open up
entirely new behaviours, communities, or experiences.

  * Facebook didn’t “solve a problem” — it created a new digital social layer.

  * Slack didn’t just fix email — it shifted how teams communicate altogether.

  * Games and creator platforms often fall into this category too.

So while “What problem are you solving?” is a useful lens, don’t let it blind
you to “What exciting behaviour could this unlock?”

> Not every big idea fixes pain. Some create joy, status, identity, or
> connection.

**Framework 5: Market Risk vs. Execution Risk**

All startup ideas carry risk — but it’s useful to ask: what kind of risk are
you taking on?

  * Market Risk: You don’t know if people will even want this (e.g., Twitter in the early days).

  * Execution Risk: You know there’s demand — but can you deliver better than incumbents? (e.g., SpaceX or Lemonade)

First-time founders often lean toward market risk (fewer direct competitors,
more room to explore). Repeat founders sometimes choose execution risk —
betting on their ability to out-execute in proven markets.

> Know which risk you’re taking — and make sure you’re equipped to handle it.

Small differences in early-stage thinking create massive differences down the
road. These frameworks can help steer you toward a sharper, stronger idea —
one that makes your years of effort genuinely worth it.

If you’re spending your life building something, make sure it’s not just
viable — but meaningful.

[Tara Viswanathan](https://x.com/TaraViswanathan), founder of Rupa Health, has
raised $42 million for Rupa with 15+ term sheets without using pitch decks.
What she used to pitch investors instead was a memo.

She strongly suggests founders use memos more (and not always decks), but why

Top secret - Investors love to see memos..

  1. First, one is not better than the other

     1. If you need to explain a key concept (i.e. your product), use a deck.

     2. If you need to explain more than 1 key concept (a complicated market & your product), use a memo. The complexity of a concept determines the format.

  2. Memos force you to think

When you explain your thinking in writing, it forces you to narrate your logic
step by step. You can get away with holes in thinking in a deck—with a memo,
it’s impossible. Even if you don’t send the memo, writing it is valuable by
itself.

  3. Memos do the hard work for investors

By creating a memo, you simplify much of the work for them. All investors need
to write internal deal memos to invest in your company. Creating a memo for
them simplifies A LOT of that work.

  4. Investment memos are dynamic.

You can include links, videos, graphs, photos, and screenshots using tools
like Dropbox. Always allow investors to explore further IF they are
interested. Let investors "choose their adventure”.

  5. Pitch decks still have value.

Use a pitch deck in partner meetings—they’re great in 1-to-many settings. Send
the memo ahead of time. Use pitch decks to drive the conversation.

  6. Your memo will live on (WAY beyond the fundraising process) ∞

Decks generally need a voice-over, memos do not. This makes memos super
valuable resources for recruiting, onboarding new hires, educating the team,
etc.

  7. Memos and decks serve different purposes.

Both are valuable. But I’m more and more convinced — writing a memo is
insanely powerful. Especially with complex/early markets that are hard to
understand.

There are lots of formats online. But if you want one that’s trusted and
proven, check out the [investment memo template by Visible
VC](https://visible.vc/blog/investment-memo/)—it's one of the best out there
for fundraising.

The North Star Metric (NSM) is widely attributed to startup founder, advisor
and investor [Sean Ellis](https://growthmethod.com/growth-marketing-
experts/#sean-ellis). It’s a single metric which can align the entire company
around an overarching mission whilst simultaneously reflecting the value being
delivered to customers.

Look at the mission statements of two of the world’s best-known companies,
Google and LinkedIn:

> Google – “Google’s mission is to organise the world’s information and make
> it universally accessible and useful”
>
> LinkedIn – “Connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive
> and successful.”

The goal of the North Star Metric is to quantify this mission and express it
in a way that can be measured and tracked. It is often used as a guiding light
for the entire company to rally around – a sort of special key performance
indicator (KPI).

Founders often make mistakes in choosing the right North Star metrics for
their startups. What is a good North Star Metric?

> Which metric, if it were to increase today will accelerate business
> flywheel? - Lenny Rachitsky

Here are some best practices for deciding on a good North Star metric:

  1. Is it measurable?

  2. It is simple, memorable and easily understood?

  3. Is it a leading (not lagging) indicator of success?

  4. Does it help your customers reach _their_ end goal?

  5. Does it apply to all customers and does it add value to all customers?

**What is a bad North Star Metric?**

There are also some poor metrics to use as a north star, the most common of
which is revenue. Below are some characteristics you should aim to avoid when
deciding on a north star metric:

  * Lagging indicators that show past performance, not future potential.

  * Metrics are hard for employees to influence or understand their impact on.

  * Metrics do not reflect customer value delivery, like vanity metrics.

  * Generic metrics that don't represent your unique business strategy.

Your north star should be unique to your business (or at the least your
business niche) and should be an indicator of the problem you solve for
customers, and the value provided to them.

Below we have provided examples of North Star metrics from many well-known
brands. Notice how they are not all perfect, but generally, all reflect value
delivered to the market.

> North Star Metrics - if this metric grows, all other metrics will be growing
> too. Such as engagement, acquisition, and sales. - Adam Wright
