##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

One of the most common patterns in the best founders? They’re not just focused
on tactics — they’re obsessed with frameworks.

While tactics come and go, frameworks act like mental maps. They help founders
see challenges clearly, make smarter decisions, and stay grounded in first
principles as they build.

The startup world runs on shared knowledge — wins, failures, and everything in
between. That’s why we’re sharing a curated collection of some of the most
useful frameworks we’ve come across, especially around fundraising.

**1\. Y Combinator Pitch Deck Framework: Access 50+ Decks That Raised Over
$450M.**

Most first-time founders overcomplicate their pitch decks or miss the mark on storytelling. A great seed deck should focus on clarity, simplicity, and a strong narrative investors can remember. This YC-backed framework walks you through each essential slide — from problem and solution to traction, market, and the ask | **[See Framework](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/y-combinator-pitch-deck-framework)**

**2\. How to Talk About Valuation When Investors Ask**

Founders often feel pressure to name a valuation early—but doing so can
backfire.  
Instead, use _price signaling_ : share past round data and invite VCs to share
what they’re seeing in the market. Focus on being fair, realistic, and
flexible—VCs are gauging not just your price, but how you negotiate. Know that
VCs care about your last round, capital raised, investor participation, and
whether you fit their ownership targets.  
Fundraising is a two-way street—ask thoughtful questions to gather signal while keeping the process collaborative. | **[See framework](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/how-to-talk-valuation-numbers-with)**

**3\. The Ladder of Proof: How Investors Evaluate Startups**

VCs often rely on a mental framework that helps them assess risk and traction — we call it the Ladder of Proof. Each step you climb gives investors more confidence that your startup is fundable and has breakout potential. From idea to product, from early users to revenue — every rung matters. Founders need to know exactly where they are on this ladder, and what signals will move them up. Clarity, proof, and momentum — that’s what earns investor conviction. | **[See framework](https://www.nfx.com/post/ladder-of-proof)**

**4\. Most founders think fundraising is all about the pitch - CRM**

But in reality, 80% of a successful raise comes down to _organization_. An investor CRM helps you stay on top of who you’ve talked to, what stage they’re at, and when to follow up—so no opportunity slips through the cracks. You don’t need fancy software. A clean Google Sheet works perfectly. We’ve put together a free CRM template + extra fundraising resources to get you started | **[See CRM framework](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/how-to-build-an-investor-crm-with).**

**5\. How Iman Abuzeid Raised from Top-Tier VCs**

Iman, CEO of Incredible Health, breaks down what really goes into a strong
fundraise—beyond just the pitch.She shares actionable lessons on identifying
the right investors, running a smooth process, and building momentum. This
includes her personal frameworks like the Fundraising Decision Tree and Pitch
Deck Structure.  
If you’re raising or planning to, this is one founder breakdown you don’t want to miss. | **[See framework](https://www.nfx.com/post/raise-venture-capital-top-tier-vcs)**

**6\. How to Build an Investor Data Room (Without Overthinking It)**  
A data room isn’t just a folder—it’s a critical part of fundraising, but
_timing matters_.  
Use a two-stage approach: share only key info before a term sheet, and detailed docs after. Start with essentials like your pitch deck, team info, traction, and a cap table summary.Google Drive is more than enough—don’t waste money on fancy tools this early. | [ ](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/how-to-build-an-investor-data-room-38d)**[See framework](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/how-to-build-an-investor-data-room-38d)**

**7\. How to Prove to Investors That Now Is the Right Time**

Founders often explain what they’re building, but forget to answer _why now_ —a key question for investors. Your job is to show how tech shifts, market timing, or regulation make your startup possible _today_ (and urgent). It’s not about being first—it’s about arriving when the conditions are right and the window is open. Nail your “why now” narrative, and you instantly add momentum, credibility, and FOMO to your pitch. | **[See framework](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/156442427/how-to-prove-to-investors-that-this-is-the-right-time-and-youre-the-right-company)**

**8\. How VCs Decide to Take First Meetings (and What Founders Often Miss)**  
Before investors invest, they decide whether you're even worth a meeting—and that decision happens fast. Strong intros, a crisp one-liner, traction, timing, and clear fundraising goals all increase your odds. Once you're in the room, it's not just _what_ you pitch—it’s _how_ you show up, speak, move, and ask questions. Pitching is performance + preparation—refine it constantly, and think like a VC when you walk in the door. | **[See Framework](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/how-do-vcs-decide-to-take-a-first-632).**

**9\. How to Handle the Most Annoying Fundraising Questions from VCs  
** Raising money means facing a mix of curiosity, skepticism, and vague maybes from investors. From “What if Google builds it?” to “Come back when you have a lead,” most VCs are testing how you _think_. This guide breaks down common VC pushbacks and how to respond with clarity, confidence, and strategy. If you're fundraising (or about to), read this before your next investor call. | **[See framework](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/9-annoying-questions-from-vc-and)**

We’ve also built multiple guides and frameworks that can be helpful to you in
your startup journey:

##### **VC TACTICS EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW…**

**When AI startups reach billion-dollar valuations in months** and market
conditions can shift overnight, traditional due diligence approaches are
pushed to their limits. VCs are challenged to validate complex technologies,
assess business model sustainability, and pick out the highest-quality deals
amid the hype.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Many founders think timelines are just a VC’s internal problem.

But the truth? It affects your chances of getting funded more than you might
think.

When you're building something ambitious—especially something that takes time
to get right—it's easy to assume that if the idea is good enough, someone will
back it. But venture capital has a ticking clock. And if your startup doesn’t
fit that timeline, even the most excited VC might still pass.

Hustle Fund recently shared some sharp[
insights](https://www.hustlefund.vc/blog-posts-founders/a-vcs-timeline-
matters-a-lot) on this, and it really resonated.  
So I’ve pulled together a few notes and takeaways that I think every founder
should see.

An angel investor is investing their own money. They’re flexible, patient, and
often driven by gut instinct or personal passion. If your startup takes 12
years to exit? Cool. They’ll wait.

VCs, on the other hand, are managing other people’s money. They’ve raised
capital from LPs—like endowments, funds of funds, or family offices—and made
promises about how and when they’ll return it.

Most VC funds run on a 10-year cycle. That’s their horizon for deploying
capital, helping companies grow, and eventually returning money to their
investors. It’s not just a guideline—it’s built into the very structure of the
fund.

Why it matters: Even if a VC loves your startup, if your timeline doesn’t
align with theirs, they might not be able to invest.

**The VC fund lifecycle: a 10-year sprint**

Here’s how a typical venture fund plays out:

  * Years 1–3 → Deploy capital (writing new checks)

  * Years 4–7 → Support portfolio companies, double down on winners

  * Years 8–10 → Exit investments and return capital to LPs

Now, let’s say a VC meets you in year 5 of their fund. Even if they invest
immediately, your company would need to exit by year 10 (or close enough to
it) for them to return capital.

And here’s the kicker: Big outcomes take time. The kinds of returns VCs
need—think 50x or 100x—don’t usually happen within 4-5 years. A 5x exit might
sound great to you, but to a fund managing dozens of portfolio companies and
trying to return 3x overall, it’s barely a blip.

VCs are under pressure to find startups that can go massive—and do it _within_
a tight window.

**Why good exits still might not be “good enough”**

Let’s walk through a scenario:

You raise from a VC in year 5 of their fund. You exit in year 9 with a 10x
return. That sounds like a win, right?

Maybe. But here’s what might actually happen:

  * That return is solid—but not transformational for the fund.

  * The VC can’t reinvest that cash into a new company (the fund’s done deploying).

  * They’re trying to close their next fund, so their energy is elsewhere.

In the end, your success doesn't move the needle much for them. Which means
they’re less likely to place the bet in the first place—especially if your
startup is still early-stage and unproven.

For many VCs, a “great” 10x in year 9 just doesn’t fit the fund math.

**Startups that often get passed on (even if they’re brilliant)**

So what kinds of startups might get a polite “no” purely because of timing?

  1. Long-horizon tech – Think deep science, biotech, or frontier tech that might take 15–20 years to mature.

  2. Meta-investment models – Startups that invest in other startups (VCs don’t want to wait for two cycles of returns).

  3. Solid-but-not-massive return profiles – Businesses with clear paths to a 5x or 10x, but unlikely to break out to 100x.

None of this says your company isn’t good. It just might not be a fit _for
venture_ , especially given the timeline pressure.

VCs don’t always say “no” because they don’t believe. Sometimes, it’s because
the math just won’t work.

**What founders should actually do**

If you’ve been hearing “no” from VCs and can’t quite figure out why, zoom out
and ask yourself:

  * Does my business fit into a 10-year window?

  * Can this company realistically return 50x+ within that time?

  * Is my product so early or complex that it needs a longer arc to deliver?

If the answers suggest you're on a longer or more unpredictable timeline, you
might be better off raising from angels, family offices, or long-horizon
investors who aren’t bound to the same fund cycle.

It’s not just about _who_ you're pitching—it's about _when_ you're pitching,
and how your story fits their model.

There’s a myth in startups that the best ideas always get funded. But it’s not
just about the idea. It’s about timing, fit, fund mechanics, and [return
](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/155318590/steps-to-know-if-your-
company-can-return-a-vc-fund)profiles.

VCs are building portfolios that match a specific promise to their LPs. If
your company doesn’t help fulfill that promise on their timeline—it might not
be a match, no matter how good it is.

And that’s okay. Because not every great company needs VC. Some of the best
founders find better matches outside the traditional fund world.

So if a VC passes, don’t just ask “Was the pitch good?” Ask: Was this the
right investor for my timeline?

Venture is changing. Not in the subtle “new cycle” kind of way. More like a
tectonic shift beneath the surface.

What used to be bundled under the roof of traditional VC firms is now
fragmenting into a new model—driven by media, personal brands, software, and a
completely different set of founder + LP expectations.

[This piece](https://jordsnel.substack.com/p/unbundling-one) I read dove into
that shift. Below are my notes and thoughts—along with what I believe are the
real insights behind all the noise.

**The venture firm is unbundling**

<https://twitter.com/sam_sends/status/1483255401562968066>

It’s no longer just about five partners in a room, picking from a proprietary
Rolodex and calling it “value add.” That bundled, legacy model is getting
picked apart—one vertical at a time. Now, some GPs are winning by building
niche communities. Others are scaling distribution through podcasts and
Substacks. Some are embedding themselves deep into founder networks, and
others are building tools that give them leverage at scale.

Emerging managers aren’t just “smaller funds.” They’re different animals
altogether. And the best of them are productizing their advantage—whether it’s
sourcing, king-making, or storytelling.

So, the traditional VC model is breaking apart. Emerging managers win by
specializing and productizing a distinct edge.

Stripped down, **a GP’s job comes down to 8 things:**

  1. Source

  2. Pick

  3. Win access

  4. Value right

  5. Construct a smart portfolio

  6. King-make

  7. Raise the next fund

  8. Return capital

Very few are great at all 8—and that’s okay. You can build a top-decile fund
by doing just 2 or 3 of these exceptionally well. Some GPs are phenomenal
pickers (like USV). Others win deals by having distribution and founder
goodwill (like a16z). Some win by moving fast (Tiger Global). Know your lane.

**“Because the internet…”**

The internet didn’t just change how founders build—it changed how VCs build,
too.

Knowledge isn’t a moat anymore. Every template, strategy, and best practice is
online. There’s a wikiHow for starting a hedge fund. Tools like Carta,
AngelList, and Odin let anyone set up a fund in days. YC made legal documents
free. And for GPs willing to dig, there’s a goldmine of public
knowledge—valuation guides, sourcing playbooks, capital stack breakdowns, you
name it.

**Distribution is a product now**

Today’s standout GPs aren’t just good investors—they’re great at telling
stories, building audiences, and moving fast.

Media-first funds are real now. 20VC, The Generalist, Packy, NFX, Redpoint’s
TikTok, a16z’s Future—these aren’t content side projects. They’re core to the
fund’s sourcing and brand strategy.

And it compounds. The more you write, the more founders read. The more you
share, the more LPs listen. The more visible you are, the more top founders
want you on their cap table.

**LPs and founders don’t want the same things**

Here’s where nuance matters. LPs and founders are buying two different
versions of you.

LPs want to know: Will you return capital? Can you raise your next fund? Are
you built to last?

Founders want to know: Will you help me raise my next round? Can you open
doors? Do you make my startup look legitimate?

That gap explains why some GPs feel like celebrities to founders but are still
raising $10M microfunds—and why others are loved by LPs but barely get into
hot deals.

**In bull markets vs bear markets, different GPs win**

In a bull market, capital is cheap, and the best GPs are the ones who _win_
access to the best deals. These are the collaborative, good-karma folks. They
spread small checks across the hottest companies, get markups, and ride the
momentum.

In a bear market, that flips. Capital is expensive. Deals slow down. Now,
_pickers_ win. The wartime generals. The ones who have conviction, discipline,
and can see around corners.

**Private > Public — and the shift isn’t slowing**

VC went from $60B invested in 2012 to $643B in 2021. That’s not random—it’s
structural.

  * LPs are hungry for higher returns

  * Private markets are less volatile, more founder-friendly

  * Start-ups need less capital and stay private longer

  * Public markets are overregulated and overcrowded

Plus, the tooling and access infrastructure is 10x better than it was a decade
ago. It’s never been easier to build a fund—or harder to make it stand out.

**GPs need product-market fit too**

Founders aren’t the only ones who need a tight pitch.

If you’re an emerging manager, you need to be just as crisp:

What’s your edge? Why now? Who is this for? How do you win?

Whether it’s through media, software, community, brand, niche sourcing, or
portfolio support—your differentiation needs to be obvious.

The venture model is being rebuilt in public, in real-time. What’s replacing
it isn’t just newer—it’s weirder, more personal, more fragmented, and way more
founder-aligned.

And honestly? That’s exciting.

If you are building your VC fund deck, I would highly recommend checking out
our previous write-up on the same topic - [Here’s the
link](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/158828099/successful-vc-fund-
decks-that-raised-over-m-from-lps).

Many founders wonder: How do VCs decide which startups to fund?[ John
Hu](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7188877819613962240/),
who’s worked at top VC firms like Goldman Sachs and Norwest Venture Partners,
shared the exact framework investors use to evaluate startups. He even applied
it to his own startup—here’s how each column was rated:

  * Team: What is the quality of your team? How strong is your “Founder-Market’Fit? Why is your team the best team to solve this problem?

  * Market Size: How large is this market? Does it have BN$+ potential

  * Competition: How competitive is this market?

  * Differentiation: How will you beat the competition? What’s your competitive angle?

  * Metrics: How strong are your metrics? How strong of a growth indication do they give?

  * Exit Potential: How many potential buyers are there of your company?

These are great points that founders can consider to grading their startup,
but there is a simpler way to grade a startup as 'A' or 'C,' as shared by
Herwig Springer -

  * 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗺  
A for taking market feedback over theory.  
C for having outside commitments at play.

  * 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁 𝗦𝗶𝘇𝗲  
A for evidence to support target market cap.  
C for overestimating the accessible market.

  * 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻  
A for having a key competitive advantage.  
C for failing to acknowledge key competitors.

  * 𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻  
A for building strong moats like proprietary technology.  
C for differentiation based on easily replicable factors.

  * 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘀  
A for balancing growth and profitability metrics.  
C for focusing on vanity metrics like sign-ups.

  * 𝗘𝘅𝗶𝘁 𝗣𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹  
A for considering options like M&A.  
C for hyperfocusing on one path.

Try it for your startup. Make sure it will be A for each column.
