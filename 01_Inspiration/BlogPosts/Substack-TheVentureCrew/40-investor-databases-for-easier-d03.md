##### **📜 DEEP DIVE**

This one’s a little different. Normally, we break down topics and share
insights, but today we’re giving you something bigger: **a massive database of
investors.** Some of these lists we found online, others we painstakingly
curated with the Venture Curator team. We’ve double-checked everything to make
sure it’s accurate, and we hope it makes your fundraising journey easier.

Before diving in, feel free to check out our previous fundraising tips on the
[Archive Page](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/35-investor-databases-
for-easier#).

Here’s what’s inside each database:

I hope this will be useful in your fundraising journey. You can also check out

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

One of the most expensive mistakes early-stage startups make isn’t a tech
decision — it’s pricing. Teams spend months debating:

  * “Should we be freemium?”

  * “Should we do a free trial?”

  * Or worse — they pick one at random, build around it, and realise later it was the wrong bet.

Gaurav Vohra, part of the founding team at Superhuman, shared one of the
[clearest frameworks](https://substack.gauravvohra.com/p/to-free-or-not-to-
free) yet for deciding how to price your product and when to stay away from
free altogether.

Here’s the breakdown founders should know.

**1\. Freemium vs. Free Trial: know the difference**

  * Freemium = free access forever, limited functionality

  * Free trial = free access for a limited time or usage

Freemium changes your entire business model. Free trial is just a funnel
experiment. Decide on freemium first; it’s a company-level decision.

**2\. When to go freemium**

Freemium only works under certain strategic conditions:

**Competitive pressure:** If cheaper or free competitors can steal the market
fast, freemium might be necessary. It’s a defensive play to cement users
before rivals do. But beware the “price war trap.” Once you and your
competitors start undercutting each other, you eventually end up at $0.

**Network effects:** If your product gets stronger with more users, freemium
fuels growth. Slack, Dropbox, and ChatGPT are examples where user scale itself
improves value.

**Data flywheel:** If free users’ data makes your product smarter (like
Grammarly or ChatGPT), a free tier is strategic. It feeds model improvement or
enables monetization via ads or new revenue streams.

If none of these are true, skip freemium.

**3\. When to go on a free trial**

If you don’t need a permanent free tier, a time- or usage-based free trial
might still make sense.

**Competitive necessity:** If every similar product in your category offers a
free trial, you’ll likely need one too. Calm and Headspace are great examples.

**Reaching lower-intent customers:** Once you’ve saturated high-intent buyers,
you may need to expand to lower-intent users. That’s why mature products like
Salesforce or Adobe use trials to widen the funnel.

**Hard-to-explain value:** If your product’s “aha” moment only happens after
people use it, free trials help. Example: Readwise — users only see value once
they connect highlights and start receiving emails.

Rule of thumb: If you can’t describe the value well, let users experience it
first.

**4\. The hidden costs of “free”**

Free is never really free. Every additional user means higher infra and AI
usage costs, more support tickets, more edge cases, and more moderation
overhead. Especially with AI products power users can destroy your margins
fast. Set usage caps early.

**5\. Freemium vs. Paid — global vs. local optimization**

Ask yourself: Is going free a global strategy or a local optimization?

Spotify’s ad revenue (around 12% of total) looks useful, but the real reason
they’re freemium is competitive pressure and audience expansion, not ads. Most
startup teams confuse small optimizations for strategic moves. Always ask if
“free” actually helps you win the market or just distracts from your main
product.

**6\. Evaluating if your pricing decision worked**

Free trial vs. pay up front is easier to test. Compare activation (day 1–30)
and revenue retention (month 1–3) between groups. You can A/B test it.

Freemium vs. paid is harder because it changes everything — funnel, CAC,
engagement, support, even product roadmap. Instead, evaluate hypotheses: Did
we beat competitors? Did we create network effects? Did we collect valuable
data? If not, “free” wasn’t worth the cost.

**7\. What Superhuman learned the hard way**

Superhuman tested both freemium and free trial. Both backfired.

  * Freemium experiment: 4x virality inside teams, but less than 25% activation or monetization. Looked great on paper, killed revenue.

  * Free trial: Users took the product less seriously. Paying up front created stronger behavior change and better retention.

Their conclusion: paying is part of the product experience.

Don’t copy pricing models blindly. Ask three questions before adding “free”:

  1. Does free make my product more valuable (via network, data, or virality)?

  2. Can I afford the cost of free users?

  3. Will customers value it more if they pay first?

Sometimes the fastest way to grow isn’t going free — it’s charging early,
proving value, and letting results spread on their own.

In a world obsessed with AI and digital automation, some of the sharpest GTM
teams are going the other way, offline.

They’re sending doormats, collectables, and cakes to prospects. It’s not
nostalgia, it’s strategy.

Joseph Bath calls this new wave [Offline Outbound
](https://josephbath.substack.com/p/offline-outbound)— a modern take on
Account Based Marketing built around physical, co-branded gestures that spark
real relationships and unforgettable brand moments.

Instead of cold emails and ads, companies are showing up - literally.

Here’s how the best ones are doing it.

**1\. Delve’s “Doormat Experiment”**

YC-backed Delve sent custom doormats reading “Your shoes look good. Do your
SOCs 2?” to 100 hot prospects.

Cost: $6K | Views: 850K | Likes: 6K | Pipeline: $500K

It worked because the object fit the message.

The doormat was symbolic, funny, and relevant to Delve’s SOC 2 compliance
product. It broke the digital pattern, sparked posts across LinkedIn, and sat
in offices as a lasting reminder.

**Lesson:** Great offline ideas tie directly to what your product represents.

**2\. Weave’s “Labubu Run”**

Weave (YC W25) wanted to stand out to engineering leaders. They sent
collectable Labubu figurines wearing custom company shirts to 42 target
accounts and their GTM lead personally ran 42 km across San Francisco to
deliver them.

He met 42 CTOs face-to-face, sparked posts from teams like Sierra and
Hightouch, and turned a physical stunt into viral digital content.

**Lesson:** Borrow cultural relevance (Labubus were trending) and turn
delivery into performance — an experience people can’t help but share.

**3\. Artisan’s “Outbound Cakes”**

Artisan (YC W24), which builds AI BDRs, sent **custom cakes** to target
prospects. Each was iced with: _“Hire Ava, she’ll make outbound a piece of
cake.”_

They paired the physical drop with digital follow-ups — automated LinkedIn and
email sequences. The mix of **human gesture + AI efficiency** created warm
leads, viral reach, and a sharp brand image.

**Lesson:** A small, thoughtful drop — combined with smart digital follow-up —
beats pure automation every time.

**What makes Offline Outbound work**

  * **Human connection:** You stop being “just another sender.” You become a person — someone who showed up with intent.

  * **Differentiation:** Everyone optimizes emails; few dare to break the channel. Going offline _is_ the pattern interrupt.

  * **Longer brand life:** A doormat or desk collectible keeps your brand visible for months — not seconds like an ad.

  * **Built-in content:** Each drop creates a shareable story, multiplying impressions far beyond the initial gesture.

**The trade-off: scalability vs. memorability**

Offline Outbound isn’t for blasting 10,000 prospects. It’s for high-ACV,
trust-driven deals where personal touch pays off.

It sits between **Brand** , **Demand Gen** , and **ABM** — less scalable than
ads, but far more memorable and trust-building.

**Why it works (by the numbers):**

  * Estimated CPM: ~$7 (vs. LinkedIn ads at $100–$200)

  * $6K spend → $500K pipeline (≈ 1:83 ratio)

  * Longevity: physical impressions last for months

Use it when:

  * You’re launching, fundraising, or riding momentum

  * You’re targeting high-fit accounts where one deal moves the needle

  * You have a story worth sharing both offline and online

**How to execute your own Offline Outbound**

  1. **Find your hook.** Pick something timely, intuitive, and shareable.

  2. **Co-brand the object.** Make it feel like a shared moment, not an ad.

  3. **Set your goal.** Pipeline? Relationship building? Account activation?

  4. **Get personal.** Know who you’re sending to — and why.

  5. **Capture the content.** Film, post, and repurpose — the content is the multiplier.

Offline Outbound isn’t a playbook. It’s a precision strike. Use it sparingly,
when story, timing, and fit align.

Because showing up in person — with something worth talking about — still cuts
deeper than any automated sequence ever will.
