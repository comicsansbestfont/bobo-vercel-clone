##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

When it comes to building a startup, one of the things that comes to a
founder’s mind is creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to test whether
their solution to a particular problem is valid or not. However, one of the
common mistakes I observe founders making is **forgetting about the "Viable"
part and just focusing on the product.**  

This common mistake is observed in 90% of startup founders and the rest 10% of
founders who know how to build MVP become startups like Airbnb, twich & stripe
etc.

Also, most of the founders mistaken the meaning of MVP - that it’s about
considering one feature and building a product. Actually - It’s more than
that!

So - In this, we will deep dive into -

  * Real Meaning of Building Minimal Viable Product (MVP)

  * How did Airbnb, Twitch, and Stripe build their MVPs?

  * How did these startups use the Y-Combinator MVP building strategy?

  * How can you build the MVP for your startup?

So grab your coffee and let’s deep dive into it!

**What is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)?**

A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough
features to be usable by early customers …— Wikipedia

**What should be your MVP mindset In the Pre-Launch Stage?**

Let’s start with the meme above. It’s called the **midwit** meme.

Many first-time founders (the guy to the left of the bell curve) launch
quickly and iterate (continue launching quickly). This is the same for the
expert founder (the guy to the right of the bell curve).

But the guy in the middle is the “ _smart founder_ ”. Let’s call him Benny.
Benny wants to do surveys, raise money, build a team, etc. He wants to do it
all. Benny learns after a while he should have been like the “dumb guys”.

> As a founder, you want to build an MVP, get it to customers, and learn if it
> helps them or not. Then iterate.

You only really _start learning about your users when you put a product in
front of them._ Not by doing 1000 surveys, gathering a mailing list, or
fundraising for half a year.

The amazing thing, your MVP might not even work how you want it to.

**Your goal as an early-stage founder:**

  * Launch quickly. (MVP)

  * Get your first customers.

  * Talk To Customers & Get Feedback

  * Iterate (Improve the product)

These goals need to be your guiding principle.  

Expect that after 3–5 iterations, your MVP would have changed so much. But
that’s a good thing. It means you’ve been listening to your customers.

Try and remember that you are not the hero of your customer’s story. You’re
not Harry Potter, you’re Dumbledore who gives him the tools to be the hero of
his own story. You serve at the pleasure of the customer.

**Is an MVP really the way to go?**

Many founders want to build a product (like the iPhone) that blows people out
of the water at once. That’s a very steep hill to climb though.

The MVP approach is best. You might have a question that -

**But What If My MVP Is Rubbish and they Never Want To Talk To Me Again?**

Even the biggest startups had this same fear. YC deals with it every time.
It’s okay that you feel this fear. But never act on it.

FEAR- False Expectations Appearing Real

Think about it. If one customer doesn’t like your product, does that kill your
startup? No. You can reach out to another customer. You can reach out to the
same customer after you’ve made the product better.

The more amazing thing is that most people who speak with startups at an early
stage are early adopters. They try out products that are in their rubbish
phase. They are used to products not working quite as well as they should.

Early users usually have a problem. They are the only ones brave enough to try
untested products that could solve the problem. They are usually there for the
long haul to give you feedback on how to make the product better.

**Fake Steve Jobs -**

These types of founders think they know exactly what the customer needs. Let’s
call them fake Steves.

In their minds, Steve Jobs built the iPhone and iPod, such amazing products in
one go. The mistake they're making is that’s not true. Many of them remember
the 3rd or 4th iteration of these products. The first iPhone had 2G internet,
no app store, etc.

You don’t know what the customer needs. The customer alone knows what they
need. If you ask them, they will tell you. How you ask them is by showing them
your MVP.

**Examples of Successful MVPs**

**1\. Airbnb:**

This is the first version of AirBnB. They didn’t have a lot of features. If
you were an early adopter, here was what you enjoyed.

  * No payment system.

  * No map view. You couldn’t see where the house was in the city.

  * You had to sleep on an airbed. The whole house could not be rented to you.

  * It was only for conferences.

**2\. Twitch:**

Twitch was the world's leading video platform and community for gamers.

But they’re now one of the most popular streaming websites in the world.

**Do you know what thing they focused on at the pre-launch stage?**

Software MVP

  * Very fast to build (weeks not months)

  * Very limited functionality

  * Appeal to a small set of users

They built a product that people loved, not one that everyone loved. It didn’t
solve all the problems. Solve problems step by step.

**Who Are These Early Adopters? Why Do They Want To Go Through So Much Pain?**

“You want to build your product for customers who have their hair on fire.”
What product would you want to buy from me?

Maybe a hose, bucket of water, or something that can bring water. Well, all I
have is a brick (my MVP). Walking away won’t even cross your mind. You’re
desperate, you’ll buy the brick and hit yourself on the head to kill the fire.

The early adopters are the desperate ones. Forget the ones that are not
desperate.

**Why surveys don’t work.**

You might have had a formal business school education. Now you’re thinking
let’s do a survey and learn everything the user needs. Then we build it.

That won’t work either.**** The customer doesn’t know everything about the
answer to their problem. They don’t even know everything about the problem
itself. If they did, don’t you think they would build the solution on their
own or hire people to do it for them?

It’s your job to know.**** Surveys help you find out your users' pain but not
how to solve it. Only a product can do that.

You give them a product and ask, does this solve your problem? Yes or no and  
you go down the scientific method flow chart from there.

**How To Build An MVP Quickly!**

Give yourself a timeframe. It’s easier to move on if you do. If you allow
endless time to build, you’ll never stop building the MVP.

Don’t keep doing a double take while building. Write everything you want to
build down now. Then you won’t have to rethink everything later.

At this point, you will cut many features. Think how important is this to
solve the user’s problem.

A startup to solve overseas payments doesn't need a chat feature in the MVP.
Neither does it need APIs connected to every bank in the world. Both are
important but can be skipped for the MVP.

**Don’t fall in love with your MVP.**

Have you heard married couples say something like: this is not the person I
married or fell in love with?

Please please please don’t fall in love with your MVP.

It will change so much as you’re iterating.

If you’re in love with it, you won't want it to change. You’re building an
emotional barrier to your growth.

**Final Thoughts**

“It’s better to have 100 customers that really love your product than 100k
that are just ok with it.” — Michael Seibel, Y-Combinator

Those 100 will give you rich feedback that you need to grow. Build for them
and the others will come when you have a shiny product.

All these concepts are covered in the

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Antler has shared a cheat sheet to help founders assess their ability to raise
capital in their initial funding round -

When it comes to fundraising, two factors can make all the difference: Founder
pedigree and Traction.

**1️⃣ Founder Pedigree:** The less traction you have, the more your background
matters. Investors look at your past to assess whether you can deliver in the
future. It's about limiting execution risk.

This isn't necessarily rational. Great founders get overlooked because they
don't fit the typical pattern. But with thousands of similar opportunities,
it's a real filter for investors.

**2️⃣ Traction:** Traction beats pedigree. When you present more than just an
idea on paper and your product has gained some traction, your ability to raise
increases. Lower-profile founders can raise funds when their idea becomes more
than just an idea.

Some factors can change the game.

  * "Levelling up cheats" moves you to one field to the right in the fundraising matrix, potentially increasing your chances. These might include factors like having a strong co-founder, industry expertise, or unique insights.

  * "Handicaps" move you to one field left, possibly making fundraising more challenging. These could be factors like a lack of relevant experience or a difficult-to-explain product.

There are two must-haves without which you won't be able to raise, regardless
of pedigree or traction:

  * Fundraising-ability: You need reasonable fundraising skills. Networking, sales skills, storytelling, and running a tight process are crucial.

  * Market attractiveness: Your market must be significant and attractive. In the early stages, it's binary - either investors get excited about the opportunity, or they don't.

Remember

  * Valuations are a function of capital raised. Assume 15-25% dilution irrespective of the amount raised. For example, if a team raises 800k, the valuation will likely be between 3.2m - 5.3m.

  * LinkedIn profile beats pitch deck in very early stages. Many investors will check your LinkedIn before deciding on a first meeting or looking at your pitch deck.

When is this wrong?

  * Numbers are purely directional. They've been validated with experienced investors, but they're not exact.

  * This model is primarily for software startups. Biotech & Hardware companies play by different rules.

  * Copycat models are very binary. Experienced teams can attract large funding, while others struggle to raise anything.

  * Raising from a rich uncle or family/friends who aren't experienced venture investors follows different rules.

Remember, great founders come from all backgrounds. If you don't fit the
"classic" profile, you might need to prove more in the beginning, but there
are countless examples of founders without traditional backgrounds building
awesome companies.

When you learn about entrepreneurship in school you’re taught to have a clear,
strong business plan and financial model when you start out, and to use that
as a way to communicate the path your business will take.

The real world is much messier. Any plan you had when you started gets changed
quickly. Every day or even hour of your time that you devote to your startup
needs to be spent getting it off the ground.

The same is true for a financial model. Your projections will be wildly wrong.

Not only that, but the levers you have at your disposal in the model may not
end up being what you think they’ll be — the entire business may change, and
you likely don’t know enough yet at the pre-seed stage to be sure.

Investors all know this. They see tons of startups and have many first-hand
data points showing that everything can change and often does. What they don’t
know is if YOU know that.

Investors are looking to de-risk the idea of investing in you. Startups are
inherently so risky that they look for ways to think of your startup as less
risky than others. One of those ways is to assess your founder mindset — how
much do you “get” what being a founder will really be like?

The thinking there is that the more you “get” it the more you’ll be able to
anticipate challenges and be emotionally steady when things get rocky.

This is a very common place where first-time founders and founders who don’t
have a strong network fail to build trust with an investor. That might not be
fair, but it’s true. Two of those signals for how well someone is ready to be
a venture-backed founder are:

**How well do they know how to prioritize their time?**

Whether they realize everything will change from their “plan” or not.
Presenting investors with detailed financial projections at the pre-seed stage
fails both of those tests.

Ok… So Why is a Financial Model Useful?

VCs who want to see a model use it as a proxy for understanding whether a
founder can correctly break down the incentives and value levers in a problem
space.

VCs want to trust that if the business needs to change, the founder will be
able to quickly figure out how to evaluate new opportunities and position
their product for success in a new market. It's just a different way of de-
risking an investment opportunity.

The simple takeaway is that each investor is different in what traits they
value and how they reach conviction. So Know your investor - talk to their
backed founders, and read their content. Think about the type of investor you
want as a partner based on their evaluation approach.

Validating products means endless iterations and quick launches, right?

Not always.

In some industries, like consumer tech, your reputation means everything. As
Mark Zuckerberg said in The Social Network, “It has to be cool.”

So how do you make a “cool” product without getting a ton of users on it?
