##### **TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

While reading about Facebook's early growth tactics, I came across various
articles by [Alex Schultz](https://twitter.com/alexschultz?lang=en), who is VP
of Growth at Facebook. He shared some of the growth tactics that most founders
missed at an early stage. So, I thought to share it with you along with my
opinions…

> What do you think matters most for growth? Great products, customers, or
> word of mouth? It’s actually the culmination of all three: Retention.

For first-time founders, growth typically revolves around creating great
products, attracting customers, and leveraging word-of-mouth marketing. Also,
they invest heavily in acquiring new customers while neglecting the crucial
aspect of retention, which often leads to business failure. Additionally, most
founders struggle with determining when to prioritize retention over customer
acquisition. So in today’s writeup, we will try to answer these questions…

If you want to grow your startup, focus on your Retention Curve (see below).

If you plot the percentage of monthly active users versus the number of days
from acquisition, you should end up with a retention curve that is asymptotic
to a line (Blue line) parallel to the X-axis. That’s when you have a viable
business.

Also look at all of your users, who have been on your product one day. What
percentage of them are monthly active?!

It’s 100% for the first 30 days, as monthly active they all signed up on one
day.

But then you look at Every single user, **on their 31st day after
registration,** what percentage of them were monthly active, 32nd day,33rd
day, 34th day? And that allows you to get a clear idea of what this curve is
gonna look like for your product.

And **you’re gonna be able to tell does it is asymptote**. It’ll get noisy out
towards the right-hand side, but you’ll be able to get a handle on it, does
this curve flatten out or not?

[](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/)This red line is the number of users
who have been on your product for a certain number of days

**If it doesn’t flatten out, don’t go and do growth tactics** , don’t go and
do virality, don’t hire a growth hacker. **Focus on getting product market
fit**. Because in the end, idea, product, team, execution.

`If you don’t have a great product, there’s no point executing well on growing
it. Because it won’t grow.`

Most startups fail to achieve product-market fit and try various growth
tactics and virality.

Most founders often get confused in this but it’s easy to figure out for your
startup using **dimensional reasoning.** What does it mean?

If you are aware of [Geoffrey
Taylor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._I._Taylor), a British physicist who
won the Nobel Prize. Just by looking at pictures of the atomic bomb, he
figured out the power of the U.S. bomb. (Read [this
article](http://www.tableausoftware.com/blog/visual-analysis-zeroth-kind-
geoffrey-taylor-and-bomb) if you want to learn exactly how Taylor did it.)

**Dimensional reasoning** involves looking at the dimensions that are involved
in a problem to come to a solution.

> Taylor used dimensional reasoning to figure out what the power of the U.S.
> atomic bomb was, as well as the ratio of power between the Russian and
> American bombs. And he ended up revealing one of the top secrets that
> existed in the world at that time.
>
> Figuring out the ratio of power between the Russian and U.S. atomic bombs is
> hard.

However, figuring out the retention rate will be not that hard. Let’s take an
example of how Facebook came up with its good retention rate from VP of
Facebook, Alex :

> There are approximately 2 billion people on the Internet (excluding China
> where Facebook is banned), and Facebook has around 1.3 billion active users.
> Divide the second number by the first to find out Facebook’s retention rate.
> It won’t give you the most accurate answer, but it’ll be close enough.

Different verticals need different terminal retention rates for them to have
successful businesses. If you’re in e-commerce and you’re retaining on a
monthly active basis like 20, or 30% of your users, you’re probably gonna do
pretty well.

If you’re in social media, and your first batch of people signing up for your
product are not like 80% retained, you’re not gonna have a massive social
media site. And so, it really depends on the vertical you’re in, and what the
retention rates are.

What you need to do is have the tools to think about who out there is
comparable. And how you can look at it and say, am I anywhere close to what
real success looks like in this vertical?

Schultz says that startups shouldn’t have growth teams because the entire
company should be focused on growth. The head of growth should be the CEO,
acting as the [north star](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_star) for where
the company wants to go.

For example, [Mark Zuckerberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg)
is Facebook’s north star because he’s always been focused on growth. In the
early years of Facebook, many companies focused on their registered users. But
Zuckerberg focused on monthly active users instead.

Schultz recounts that, when Zuckerberg talked about growth, he meant “everyone
active on Facebook, not everyone signed up on Facebook” and that was the
internal goal. “It was the number he made the whole world hold Facebook to, as
a number that we cared about.”

[Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) followed a similar model when it came to
measuring growth. They’ve always benchmarked themselves against the number of
nights booked compared to the largest hotel chains in the world.

The takeaway is that the metric for growth varies from company to company.
What matters is that the CEO is focused on that metric, acting as the
company’s north star.

“Let’s say you have an awesome product market fit. You’ve built an ecommerce
site, and you have 60% of people coming back every single month, and making a
purchase from you, which would be absolutely fantastic. How do you then take
that and say, ‘Now it’s time to scale.’ That’s where growth teams come in,”
Schultz explains.

When you hear the term “magic moment,” you might think of a touching moment
between a couple or some song. But there is another magic moment: when users
first see value in your business.

The magic moment for Facebook? Schultz says it’s when people can see their
friends. It’s that simple. The magic moment takes place when you first see
that first picture of one of your friends on Facebook and you realize, “Oh my
God, this is what this site is about!”

For Zuckerberg, that magic moment depended on getting people to 10 friends in
14 days. The most important thing in a social media site is connecting to your
friends. Without that, you have a completely empty newsfeed and you’re not
going to come back because you’ll never get any friends telling you about
things you’re missing on the site.

Facebook, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/),
[WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/), and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) – all pay attention to showing you the
people you want to follow, connect to, and send messages to, as quickly as
possible because that’s what matters. In a different vertical,
[eBay](http://www.ebay.com/)‘s magic moment is when you list an item on their
platform and get paid.

You need to think about what the magic moment is for your product and get
users connected to it as fast as possible. Then you can move up where that
blue line (on the retention curve graph) becomes asymptotic. If you can
connect people with what draws them to your site, then you can go from 60%
retention to 70% retention easily, explains Schultz.

Schultz says that you get to that magic moment by “focusing on the marginal
user – the one person who doesn’t get a notification in a given day, month, or
year.” Building an awesome product is all about the power user. But when it
comes to driving growth, you don’t need to worry about people who are already
using your product.

[Sean Parker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Parker) approaches virality in
terms of three things: payload (how many people can you hit with any given
viral blast), [conversion
rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_rate_optimization), and
frequency. These three factors give you a fundamental idea of how viral a
product is.

[Hotmail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlook.com) (now called Outlook) is
“the canonical example of brilliant viral marketing,” according to Schultz.

When Hotmail first entered the email scene, people couldn’t get free email
clients because they had to be tied to their
[ISP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider). Hotmail and a
few other companies launched, and their users were able to access their mail
from wherever they were.

Most of these email companies tried to get clients by spending tons of money
on TV, billboard, and newspaper campaigns, but Hotmail couldn’t do that
because they didn’t have a lot of funding. So they added a little link at the
bottom of every email that said, “Sent from Hotmail. Get your free email
here.”

Because Hotmail users were usually emailing just one person at a time, the
payload was low. However, the frequency was high because users were emailing
the same people over and over. So those people were going to be hit one to
three times per day, increasing impressions. And the conversion rate was also
really high because people didn’t like being tied to their ISP email.

In the end, Hotmail became extremely viral because of its high frequency and
high conversion rates.

That’s it. So overall

  * Retention is crucial for startup growth, with the retention curve being the most important graph for founders.

  * Startups should focus on achieving product-market fit before pursuing growth tactics, as indicated by a flattening retention curve. 

  * The "magic moment" is when users find value in a product and tactics for virality, like high frequency and conversion rates, are emphasized for sustained growth.

##### **TODAY’S QUICK DIVE**

2021 was the heyday for new entrants in venture capital: First-time
fundraising reached a peak of $14.7 billion, including more inexperienced
managers without bulletproof track records or networks. Now that LPs have
retreated, those same fund managers are in trouble.

A report by Pitchbook says - 37% Of First-time VCs might not be able to raise
2nd funds. Between 2006 and the end of 2018, 63.0% of US VC first-time
managers raised a second fund 5.

  1. In 2023, the time between first-time and sophomore funds increased to a near-record 2.6 years.

  2. Historically, 76.7% of first-time Managers who secured $50 million in commitments for their initial fund successfully raised a second fund. and just 42.3% for managers with undisclosed fund sizes.

  3. Just 56.7% of first-time managers outside of California, New York, and Massachusetts have historically gone on to raise a second VC fund.

  4. The time between the first and second funds historically hovers around two years, but in 2023, it increased to 2.6 years.

  5. This study estimated that 247 of the 667 first-time managers who closed funds between 2019 and 2021 may be unable to raise a sophomore fund.… **[More Here](https://tech.eu/2024/02/10/europe-needs-more-scientists-in-vc-to-become-a-deep-tech-powerhouse/)**

A report by Pitchbook - Venture capital funds have experienced negative
returns for the fourth consecutive quarter.

  * Funds under $250 million showed a notable improvement in one-year return through Q2 2023 compared to previous quarters.

  * The performance of VC funds has been challenging, with struggles in recent periods due to backtracking on 2021 valuation markups.

  * Public markets saw strong performance in 2023, with double-digit returns in Q4, raising questions about whether VC and PE will track similar results.

  * Preliminary returns for Q3 2023 in the private market strategies show a slightly positive overall figure of 0.2%.

Overall, the venture capital sector faces ongoing challenges in performance,
with the need to address valuation markups and align with the positive trends
seen in public markets.

A recent analysis by [Carta
](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7164310171832311809/)\-
from 17,000 primary venture rounds since 2020 reveals key trends in founder
dilution. Here is how much founders are selling to investors:

  * 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗦𝗲𝗲𝗱 • 20.6% median in 2023 • Nudging down from 2020, but flat from 2022

  * 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗔 • 20.1% median in 2023 • Consistently notched downward over the past 4 years 

  * 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗕 • 17.6% median in 2023 • Bumped up from 17.1% in 2022 

  * 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗖 • 13.4% median in 2023 • Essentially flat from 2022 

  * 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗗 • 11.5% median in 2023 • Sizable rise from the 10.4% median in 202

In fundraising through SAFEs and Convertible Notes, founders typically sell
around 18% in major SAFE rounds (>$2M) and 8-10% in minor SAFE rounds.
Employee option pools start at 10% and can grow to 20% by Series D.

Each fundraising round varies, with founders selling different percentages.
The dead equity from early exits can impact future funding enthusiasm. No
fixed rules, but these benchmarks highlight potential dilution challenges.
