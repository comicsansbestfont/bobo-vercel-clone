##### **TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

**There’s one slide** that almost every founder gets wrong when they are
putting together a pitch deck to raise money from venture capitalists. The
slide is usually known as “the ask,” and it typically lives toward the end of
the pitch deck.

It is meant to do something pretty straightforward: Explain how much money a
startup is raising and for what. It shouldn’t be rocket science, but it’s
almost universally a struggle to get right.

Here are the most common mistakes:

  1. Forgetting to include the slide altogether.

  2. Not naming a specific dollar amount you are raising.

  3. Including a valuation on the slide.

  4. Omitting what the funds will be used for.

  5. Listing a specific runway, i.e., “This will keep us running for 18 to 24 months.”

Let’s explore in detail why these mistakes are so detrimental to your
fundraising process and how you can best include these points in your deck.

Obviously, the easiest way to fail on this slide is to forget to include it
altogether. That’s a mistake. The whole purpose of doing a fundraising process
is to raise money, so you may as well go all-in with a clear ask.

Quite a few founders are against including any amount at all. The logic, they
argue, is that there are so many different ways to build the company. If they
raise $3 million, they go down one path. If they are able to raise $5 million,
they go down another. If the fundraising doesn’t go as smoothly as they hoped,
and they’re only able to scrape together $1.5 million, they’ll make that work,
too.

It’s good to be scrappy and adaptable as a founder, but you need a Plan A:
What, in your opinion, is the right amount of money to raise to get the
company to the next stage of growth and the next round of funding? Of course,
it’s possible that your lead investor wants to push you toward raising more or
less than that, but you need to have a solid picture of how you’re going to
get from where you are today to where you want to go.

Don’t list a range. Don’t mention that you have 28 different plans for how to
make your company successful. The investors are going to want to see that you
can be decisive and strategic. Make your Plan A, stick a dollar amount on it,
and put that dollar amount on your “ask” slide.

In other words: If you are raising a seed round now, think about what you need
to prove to your investors to be able to raise a Series A next. Map all of
that out and determine what resources you need to get there. That’s how much
money you need if everything goes to plan. Add 30% to 70% as a safety buffer
(depending on how good your planning is and how predictable your business is),
and that’s how much money you need to raise.

Another common mistake I see is that founders include the terms of an
investment, or the valuation, on a slide. If you put “raising $5 million at a
$20 million valuation” on the slide before you have a lead investor, you’re
making a mistake. You may have an opinion for what valuation you are hoping
for, of course, but that will come out as part of the negotiation later on.
The amount of money you need is fixed-ish; what you are willing to give up in
order to raise those funds is not.

In the best-case scenario, you find two or three lead investors who end up in
a bidding war for the privilege of investing in you. The levers they have
available aren’t just the valuation of the company, of course — there are
plenty of other clauses that are up for negotiation in a funding process.

The one exception to this is if you already have a lead investor and you’re
just looking to close out the round. In that case, your “ask” slide can
include the name of the lead investor and the terms agreed upon. “Raising $5
million at a $20 million valuation, and Investor X has committed $3 million of
the round” can work. Having said that, if you’re _that_ far into your funding
round, there’s probably enough inertia to close out the round; it’s unlikely
to be necessary to update this slide once you have a signed term sheet in
hand.

> You’re running a startup, and you’re going to want to raise money to
> accomplish something. Makes sense. What doesn’t make any sense at all is how
> many founders seem to be shy about sharing the details of the plan. A lot of
> the due diligence process is going to be focused on figuring out whether you
> are a competent, believable founder and showing that you have a detailed
> plan and vision for what’s going to happen over the next stretch of time.

**Put differently:** If I’m going to invest $2 million into your startup, I
want to know what that money buys me, in terms of progress for your company.

Ideally, your company has an operating plan as part of the pitch deck, which
goes into detail about what is going to happen between this and the next
funding round. On the “ask” slide, however, you have the opportunity to
summarize in three or four bullet points what you’re going to do with the
money.

> **Typically, you’re going to want to include product, traction, market
> validation and key hire milestones.**

  * **Product** — What product milestones do you need to hit in order to raise the next tranche of money? In particular, this includes beta or full product launches, major feature sets in the product pipeline or integrations with partners.

  * **Traction** — What business metrics do you need to achieve in order to raise more money? How many units do you have to sell, how many subscribers do you need, how many customers do you want? Other metrics may also be helpful here — your net promoter score (NPS), monthly active users, etc.

  * **Market validation** — What can you do to prove that there’s a real market out there willing to pay for the product or service you are peddling?

  * **Key hires** — In order to reach the above goals, you probably need to hire. How many people do you need to hire? When?

Each of these goals should be SMART: specific, measurable, achievable,
relevant and time-based. Poor goals are vague: “Improve marketing,” or “Get
more customers” or “Add features to our product.”

Examples of great SMART goals:

  * “By June 2024, we need 2,000 paying customers on our recurring subscription model.”

  * “In the next six months, we need to reduce our customer acquisition cost by 20%.”

  * “Our B2B sales need to improve, so by July we are aiming to hire an experienced VP of sales who can help shape our sales processes.”

Be. Specific.

As we hinted at above, it’s important to list the milestones you believe you
need to achieve to raise the next round of funding. Note that this is
milestone-driven; each goal unlocks the next part of the journey. But that
doesn’t mean that you’re explicitly talking about time.

You are not raising money to get 18 months of runway. You are raising money to
hit a certain set of milestones. If you can do that in 12 months, then you
raise your next round of funding in a year. If you need 24 months, that’s OK,
too. Don’t get too hung up on the timeline; some things take more time than
you might expect. That makes sense; this is a startup — _nothing_ ever goes to
plan.

The corollary of this is that you need to bake enough wiggle room into your
plans. If you expect something to take 18 months, but it takes 24, it’s a
really poor look if you run out of money in month 19.

The “ask” slide is one of the most painful slides to get wrong because it
shows that you aren’t a very good founder. Perhaps you’re a great technical
co-founder, a brilliant salesperson or an incredible marketer, and that’s
great — but the job of the founder is to have a specific, actionable,
reasonable plan in place to navigate through choppy waters.

Having a poor “ask and use of funds” slide is a huge red flag to many
investors. After all, investors have a conga line of smart, talented folks
coming through the door day in and day out.

To stand out, you can’t just be good at marketing, sales, development or any
of the other aspects of running a business. You have to be good at the _art_
of running the business, too — and this is one of the slides where you get to
show off and prove that you know what you’re doing. Don’t waste that
opportunity.

##### **FEATURED POST**

Founders often struggle with the question, **"How much is my startup worth?"**
when it comes to raising capital.

Let's call things the way they are... nobody knows how much a Pre-Revenue (or
even early revenue) company is worth.

Pro-formas = spreadsheet millionaire and nothing more besides something to
help understand the path forward.

_DCFs don't work as there are no cash flows to model off of (good luck setting
the right discount rate anyway)_ and any exit multiples are simply just a
comparative estimate of what the company might become. Unless there's real
traction, I believe a DCF or comp analysis is going to come up short.

So... _if you don't have traction yet and you need capital_ to get there
(assuming debt isn't an option) what are you supposed to do?.….. **[Read More

##### **TWEET OF THIS WEEK**

Do you think the board of advisors add value?

I've noticed that many startups include a specific slide in their pitch decks
dedicated to them. However, I've never quite understood the value they bring.
While I acknowledge the importance of having a board of advisors in certain
sectors, I'm curious about their actual impact. Personally, I think -

“**Having a board of advisors in your pitch is a negative sign.**

They rarely add the value you think they will. Fine to incentivize some people
to help you but they aren’t usually an important part of the story.”
