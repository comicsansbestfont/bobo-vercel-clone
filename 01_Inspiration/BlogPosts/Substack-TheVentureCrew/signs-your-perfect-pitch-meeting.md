##### **TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

The other day, a founder friend reached out to me, super excited after their
VC meeting. "It went amazing!" they said. When I asked why they thought so,
they mentioned the investor's positive energy and how they seemed to get the
vision. I had to break it to them gently - those weren't good signs.

Here's the reality about fundraising that most founders miss: VCs often
communicate their disinterest in really subtle ways. After years in this
space, I've noticed some clear patterns that might seem counterintuitive at
first. Let me break down all the signs I've seen:

The **"Too Nice" Investor:** If they're just nodding along without challenging
your assumptions or asking tough questions, that's usually not a good sign.
Think about it - if someone was seriously considering giving you money,
wouldn't they want to poke holes in your idea? Startups are risky, and
interested investors want to make sure your thinking holds up under pressure.

The "No Feedback" Meeting: When investors **don't offer any constructive
criticism,** that's often a red flag. The interested ones usually can't help
themselves - they'll share ideas about how to make your pitch stronger or
suggest product improvements. It's because they're already mentally invested
in your success.

The "No Network" Response: Here's something telling - interested investors
typically **want to derisk their potential investment** by getting more data
points. They'll connect you with potential customers or other investors in
their network. It's not just generosity - they're actually building a case for
investing in you.

The "No Sell" Meeting: Remember, capital is everywhere these days. When VCs
really want in, **they'll spend time selling you on their firm**. They'll talk
about their network, brag about successful founders they've backed, mention
perks like office space, and really emphasize how they could specifically help
your company grow. If you're not hearing any of this, they probably don't
think they need to compete for your deal.

The "No Homework" Sign: Something subtle that many miss - **if an investor
isn't doing blind reference checks** or reaching out to people who know you,
they're probably not serious. When they're interested, they'll do their
homework, often talking to people you haven't even listed as references.

The "Valuation Obsession": Here's a counterintuitive one - if an **investor is
getting really hung up on your valuation** , it might be their way of finding
a polite exit. Sure, funds have ownership targets, but when they're truly
excited about a deal, they'll work to make the numbers work.

The "Junior Partner Loop": If you **can't seem to get past junior team
members** to the real decision-makers, it's often because either your deal
hasn't been sold well internally, or there's already a 'no' that no one wants
to communicate directly.

The "Vague Next Steps": Each VC firm has their standard process. If you're
**not hearing clear next steps after a meeting,** or getting vague answers
when you ask, they probably don't plan on moving forward.

The "Slow Response" Pattern: Hot deals move fast, and investors know this. If
**you're** **waiting days for email responses or getting ghosted** , they're
probably not that interested. Excited investors don't risk missing out by
being slow.

The "Data Fishing" Experience: **Watch out for investors who keep asking for
more data** or market opinions without sharing anything about their investment
process. Sometimes they're just gathering intel for other deals they're more
serious about. If you are regular reader of this newsletter, I have multiple
times told to not share all data at once.

The "Unprepared Meeting": **If an investor hasn't even read your deck before
the call,** it's usually a sign they're not that excited about the
opportunity. Interested investors come prepared to make the most of their time
with you.

Remember though - these are patterns, not absolute rules. The startup world is
full of exceptions. But knowing these signals can help you spend your time
more wisely during fundraising and manage your emotional energy better.

P.S. One interesting thing I've learned is that many founders lack this
insight simply because they've never sat on the other side of the table. It's
not about being naive - it's just that the VC world has its own unspoken
language that takes time to learn.

I encourage founders to spend enough time reading all these articles. These
will help you find the right amount to raise, with negotiations and closing
successful funding rounds.

(Hint: V isn’t for viable — it’s for valuable)

Most startups fail because first-time founders either under-invest and create
something untested based on gut instinct, or over-invest without validating if
it provides value.

The crucial question is not "how can I solve this problem?" but "how can I
create a valuable experience that people desperately need and will pay for?"

The example of Thomas Edison's light bulb invention highlights this - existing
bulbs were viable but not valuable as they didn't last long. Edison focused on
creating a Minimum Valuable Experience (MVE) by making affordable, durable
bulbs that provided the illumination people craved.

**To identify an MVE, use the A.C.T. framework:**

  * Audience - Deeply understand your ideal customer segment, their behaviours, goals, and what they seek.

  * Communication - Craft messaging using language and formats that resonate with your audience.

  * Touchpoints - Design triggers and channels to move your audience to action effectively.

The startup Webflow exemplifies mastering A.C.T. The founders envisioned
empowering designers through no-code web design. They intimately knew this
audience, positioned Webflow's unique value and gained explosive traction via
platforms like Hacker News. Though facing numerous setbacks, their clarity of
vision and customer focus ultimately led to billions in valuation.

Startups must relentlessly pursue creating meaningful experiences, not just
viable products. Continuously adapt based on audience feedback. Success stems
from this laser focus on delivering an MVE that genuinely improves customers'
lives in ways they'll pay for. Must recommend reading this article by **[Pete
Sena](https://ehandbook.com/mvp-is-over-you-need-to-think-about-
mve-5a87bc7ca2ef).**

Low-risk decisions should be made pretty quickly. For high-risk decisions, a
decision-making framework can be helpful.

I’ve seen a lot of decision-making frameworks. But I like **[this
one](https://barmstrong.medium.com/how-we-make-decisions-at-coinbase-
cd6c630322e9)** from Brian Armstrong, the founder of Coinbase because it works
both for quick 15-minute live meetings and over multi-week strategic
decisions.

This framework can be used to decide:

  * Whether to hire a candidate

  * What to prioritize next in a product roadmap

  * Whether to buy or sell a company

  * A new name for a product or team

  * And more…

[Here’s the template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xYCr46GeyeZ-
JJMyxWRM0sb-1DI3lqNGwQ5iBxKCOqA/edit) to implement this framework and [here’s
how to use it](https://barmstrong.medium.com/how-we-make-decisions-at-
coinbase-
cd6c630322e9?utm_source=houck.news&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=learn-
fast-to-grow-fast).

You might think this template looks overly simplistic, but what I like about
it is that it’s just meant to record the context around the decision and
provide a clear voting framework.

It forces the actual decision-making process to happen through live
conversation. And no matter what you’ll end up with a clear, numerical score
for the option that you collectively favour.
