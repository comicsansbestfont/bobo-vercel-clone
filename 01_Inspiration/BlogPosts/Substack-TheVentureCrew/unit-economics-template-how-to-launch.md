##### **START WITH**

Ramp’s [data confirms](https://ramp.com/velocity/san-francisco-tech-
workers-996-schedule) it: 996 culture (9 a.m.–9 p.m., 6 days a week) is now a
measurable reality in San Francisco.

  * 400% surge in Saturday corporate food spend vs 2024.

  * Activity runs from noon through midnight, proving teams are working weekends.

  * This didn’t exist in 2023/2024 — it’s brand new in 2025.

  * The pattern is SF-concentrated but spans sectors beyond just tech.

**What this means for you as a founder**

  1. Velocity gap is real → A 6-day team ships 20% faster. If you don’t match hours, you must compete on productivity per hour.

  2. Customer expectations reset → Weekend Slack messages, faster feature requests, and 24/7 support will start to feel normal for Bay Area customers.

  3. Talent splits in two → Ambitious hires may seek 996; others will avoid it. You need to pick a clear stance, either intensity or sustainability.

**4 Playbooks founders can run**

  * Embrace 996: Be upfront in hiring, pay for intensity, and build systems to prevent burnout.

  * Compete on efficiency: Eliminate waste (meetings, context switching), invest in automation, and hire A-players who can deliver more in fewer hours.

  * Differentiate on sustainability: Market work-life balance, target enterprise or non-SF customers, and make stability your brand.

  * Hybrid model: Design sprint cycles with recovery weeks, rotate “surge teams,” or adopt seasonal intensity aligned with launches.

996 is no longer a debate—it’s a structural shift in how SF companies operate.
You don’t need to follow it blindly, but you do need to decide your playbook
now: match the intensity, out-optimise it, or stand apart by offering balance.

Uncertainty is no longer an occasional disruption; it’s the operating system
of business today. Regulations, politics, and tech waves (AI, cloud, mobile,
social) now move faster than most companies can adapt.

But some companies do turn this chaos into an advantage. McKinsey’s
[research](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-
telecommunications/our-insights/winning-through-the-turns-how-smart-companies-
can-thrive-amid-uncertainty) shows five practical levers that separate winners
from the pack:

**1\. Reassess where to play**

Don’t assume today’s market will stay your best bet. Winners regularly re-map
where momentum is shifting (e.g., from hardware to AI-driven software).

  * Audit your portfolio: Which markets are growing fastest? Which are slowing down?

  * Run scenarios: What happens if regulation makes your current market less attractive?

  * Example: Microsoft’s pivot from PCs to cloud (Azure) was a “where to play” move years ahead of rivals.

Action: Once a quarter, review your market map. Mark one segment to double
down on, and one to wind down.

**2\. Innovate your business model**

Products don’t just compete; models compete. Subscription vs. one-time, usage-
based vs. outcome-based, bundled vs. unbundled.

  * Ask: Is our current pricing aligned with how customers prefer to pay?

  * Explore production/delivery changes (e.g., open-source with paid support, or platform strategy vs. point solution).

  * Example: Adobe’s shift from selling boxed software to subscriptions unlocked a 10x market cap increase.

Action: Pick one business model experiment this year (pricing test, new
delivery channel, or partner-driven revenue).

**3\. Link talent to value**

Most companies misallocate their best people. Winners put their _A-players_ in
the 15–20 roles that actually drive disproportionate value.

  * Identify the critical roles (not titles) that directly impact revenue growth, customer success, or product velocity.

  * Assign top performers to those, even if it means moving them out of “important-looking” jobs.

  * Example: HubSpot’s CEO stressed redeploying talent quickly into growth-critical roles as they scaled.

Action: List your top 10% talent and the top 10% most value-driving roles. Do
they overlap? If not, realign.

**4\. Dynamically allocate capital**

Most companies plan budgets like last year +/– 5%. Winners move capital like
portfolio managers, aggressively.

  * Divide investments into three buckets: core, growth, and disruptor bets.

  * Reallocate quarterly based on traction instead of waiting for annual cycles.

  * Example: Dell reallocated aggressively into storage, then AI, instead of sticking with PCs.

Action: Next quarter, shift at least 5–10% of spend from underperforming areas
into high-growth bets.

**5\. Programmatic M &A**

One-off “big bang” deals are risky. The best companies do smaller, regular
acquisitions/divestitures that strengthen their position.

  * Focus on 3–5 targeted deals per year, not one mega-deal.

  * Use M&A to acquire missing capabilities, talent, or niche customer bases.

  * Example: SaaS companies that expand into adjacent platforms via small acquisitions consistently earn higher multiples.

Action: Identify 2–3 small acquisition targets or partnership opportunities
aligned with your roadmap.

Tech companies are staying private longer than ever — averaging 16 years to
IPO today, up from 12 in 2015. With $2T+ in private capital raised in the past
decade, founders have little incentive to rush public.

What this means for builders:

  * **Secondaries replace IPOs for liquidity** : Tender offers and structured sales let employees and early investors cash out years before a listing. OpenAI and Canva are already running multi-billion-dollar secondaries.

  * **VCs and PE capture more upside** : Most value creation happens privately, so expect late-stage investors to dominate growth rounds and push IPOs further out.

  * **New exit models emerge** : Minority stakes, reverse acqui-hires, and hybrid deals allow acquirers to secure AI talent and tech without triggering antitrust.

  * **Public markets act as clearinghouses** : When IPOs do happen, they’re less about raising capital and more about providing liquidity at fair value.

Takeaway: If you’re building now, plan for a long private journey. Structure
your fundraising, employee equity, and liquidity options with the assumption
that you’ll be private for 15–20 years. ([Read full report

##### **SOMETHING MORE**

Most founders overthink launches. They keep tinkering, waiting for “perfect,”
and end up stuck in stealth. Claire Butler, Figma’s first marketer,
[says](https://review.firstround.com/how-to-launch-your-startup-out-of-
stealth/) the opposite is true: momentum beats perfection.

Here’s her framework for stepping out of stealth without stalling:

**1\. Set a date, even if it feels early**

  * Don’t wait for every feature to be done—just reach “critical mass.”

  * Figma launched without multiplayer (its core feature) to avoid stagnation.

  * Rule of thumb: if you’re not slightly embarrassed, you’ve waited too long.

**2\. Create three forcing-function artifacts**

  * **Website** : One homepage + about/careers. Define tone, positioning, CTA. (Waitlist vs sign-up vs talk to sales?)

  * **Announcement post** : Founder-written narrative → why you built it, why now, where it’s headed.

  * **Social post** : Distill it all into a single screenshot, video, or punchy tagline. If it feels fluffy, rewrite until it’s authentic.

**3\. Pick launch channels wisely**

  * Focus where your ICP already hangs out (Reddit, Discord, LinkedIn, Twitter/X).

  * Use founder accounts to amplify first—brand handles start from zero.

  * Press is optional. Unless tied to funding, don’t waste time chasing exclusives.

**4\. Seed amplification before launch**

  * Build a list: friends, beta users, influencers, your network.

  * Tell them when launch is, what you’ll need, and share links day-of.

  * Momentum spreads outward from your circle—plan it, don’t wing it.

**5\. Remember: launch ≠ finish line**

  * Monitor replies, engage, and bookmark supporters for ongoing community building.

  * Don’t obsess over metrics too soon—track impressions, traffic, sign-ups, but focus on vibes + momentum.

  * A flashy launch ≠ product-market fit. The real game starts after.

A launch is a forcing function, not a final exam. Prep your date, artefacts,
channels, and amplification. Then get out there; momentum matters more than
perfection.

Most creators think 3–5 emails are enough to sell their product. But the
truth? That barely scratches the surface.

Nicolas Cole (co-founder of Ship 30 for 30)
[shared](https://x.com/Nicolascole77/status/1778438922785247332) data from 20+
cohorts, 10,000+ students, and millions in sales, and the answer shocked a lot
of people:

On average, it takes nearly 20 emails before someone finally buys. Sometimes
more. (Founder can easily create a simple email newsletter to sell their
products)

At first, Cole and his team made the same mistake most of us do: worrying that
sending “too many emails” would annoy people. But the data proved the
opposite. As long as you keep giving away free education and insights, more
emails = more sales.

The key: split your launch sequence into two clear halves.

**Part 1: 100% education (emails 1–10)**  
Goal: build authority and remind them your product exists. Each email is 99%
free value, 1% soft CTA.

  * #1 Plain pitch: what you sell, the problem it solves, how to buy.

  * #2 Who it’s for: 3 archetypes you serve best.

  * #3 10 biggest problems: why common fixes fail and why your approach is different.

  * #4 Desired outcomes: top 3 results your audience wants (and how you help).

  * #5 Your story: past struggles, transformation, credibility.

  * #6 Stop/Start: what to quit doing, what to do instead.

  * #7 Myths: common false beliefs + reframes.

  * #8 Quick tips: actionable advice they can use today.

  * #9 Mistakes: traps people fall into, how to avoid them.

  * #10 Templates: share one, hint at more inside your product.

**Part 2: 100% sales (emails 11–20)**  
Goal: force a decision—buy or unsubscribe.

  * #11 Everything included: break down your product clearly.

  * #12 Bonuses: extra perks they get.

  * #13 Testimonials roundup: social proof at scale.

  * #14 Future pacing: where will they be in 1 year (with vs. without your product)?

  * #15 Testimonial deep dive: one student’s full journey.

  * #16 Tale of 2 archetypes: buyer vs. non-buyer outcomes.

  * #17 On-the-fence survey: ask why they haven’t bought (time, readiness, cost).

  * #18 Behind the scenes: peek into modules/resources.

  * #19 Disappearing bonus: add urgency with a 48-hour perk.

  * #20 Disappearing discount: final 48-hour price incentive.

**Why it works**

  * Buyers need repetition: the average person doesn’t convert after a few nudges; they need to be reminded, educated, and reassured.

  * The first half builds trust and authority; the second half applies pressure and urgency.

  * If you’re not willing to craft 20 emails, don’t be surprised if sales stay flat.

If you’re launching a product, map your next sequence using this exact
20-email framework. Write the first 10 as pure education, then switch gears
into direct selling. More emails = more sales.

Finding the right startup idea shouldn’t feel like swimming upstream. If you
start where people already share their problems, the ideas come to you.
Nicolas Cole shared a playbook that combines Reddit with AI tools to surface
winning ideas in just a few steps.

**Step 1: Spot the right subreddits**

  * Use Gummy Search to track trending subreddits.

  * Focus on communities with 10k–100k members (engaged, but less competitive).

  * Check growth trends (daily/weekly/monthly).

  * Ask: “Why now?” to ensure timing is right.

  * Layer in your unfair advantage (skills, network, expertise) to build a moat.

**Step 2: Extract real problems**

  * Add the subreddit to your Gummy Search audience.

  * Scan “pain and anger” posts for frustrations.

  * Review advice/solution requests to see where people need help.

  * Write down recurring themes—patterns are your signal.

**Step 3: Learn from creators**

  * Use Perplexity AI to identify top influencers in the niche.

  * Search YouTube for popular videos + read the comments.

  * Analyse 20–25 videos for repeated audience needs.

  * With vidIQ (Chrome extension), sort popular videos by “contains a question” → instant insight into what people ask.

**Step 4: Wireframe the idea**

  * Draft a quick product/service sketch based on insights.

  * Use Framer (or similar tools) to prototype.

  * Pick a catchy, relevant name.

  * Example: DesignScientist for conversion-focused design.

**Bonus: Build your niche audience**

  * Use Gummy Search “top content” to see what performs.

  * Ask AI: “Does this audience love memes, long posts, or quick tips?”

  * Treat AI tools as your entrepreneurial assistant.

  * Keep a running “ideas” note in iOS (or Notion).

  * Set a weekly ritual (e.g., Friday mornings) to refine content ideas.

The best startup ideas live where people complain, ask for help, and share
solutions—Reddit, YouTube, TikTok. Use AI to filter the noise, spot trends
early, and translate them into prototypes fast.

After 2 years in stealth, Default launched 10 months ago, raised $11M, and
built multiple products for revenue teams.

Nico Ferrero shared the GTM lessons that mattered most:

  1. **Warm intros can kill you**  
Don’t rely on investor intros. Early GTM = losing deals, building your own
pipeline, iterating until customers say yes.

  2. **Prove yourself wrong, often**  
Early GTM is trial + error. Keep invalidating your assumptions until product,
market, and messaging click.

  3. **Sell to learn before you sell to earn**  
Don’t chase revenue or hires too soon. Use early sales to get feedback, not to
scale.

  4. **Invest in RevOps early**  
Weak systems = broken growth. Get a consultant/agency to set up processes
before scaling.

  5. **To win enterprise logos, be different**  
Procurement knows the landscape. “Better alternative” won’t cut it. Pull real
economic or social levers.

  6. **Founders are the best sales reps**  
Why? Because you actually care. That obsession doesn’t scale, which is why
early sales hires churn.

  7. **Hire an AE before a BDR**  
Nico closed 40 deals himself before hiring. An AE helps close; a BDR adds
overhead if you can’t convert.

  8. **Founder-led marketing wins**  
Startups are spectator sports. Share your story, wins, and progress—people
cheer and back you with their budget.

Early GTM isn’t about hacks. It’s about obsession with the customer, proving
yourself wrong, and building systems that don’t break when you finally start
to scale.

Most founders talk about growth. Few can clearly show how each new customer
makes or loses them money. That’s why running a unit economics model early
matters; it tells you if your business will compound or collapse.

Here’s how to use the sheet I’ve shared:

1\. Map your revenues

  * Enter your average revenue per unit (subscription, fee, or transaction).

  * Decide if it’s recurring (monthly/annual) or one-time.

  * Pro tip: if you don’t know exact numbers yet, start with estimates and refine over time.

2\. Add cost of sales (COGS)

  * Enter costs as a % of revenue (hosting, delivery, support).

  * The sheet calculates your gross margin per unit automatically.

3\. Plug in churn + growth assumptions

  * Set billing cycle (monthly = 1, annual = 12).

  * Add churn % (customers who drop each cycle).

  * Add expected annual margin growth (e.g., 5%).

  * The model uses these to estimate the average customer lifetime.

4\. Add acquisition + retention costs

5\. Review key outputs

  * LTV (Lifetime Value): how much a customer is worth over their lifecycle.

  * LTV/CAC ratio: >3 is usually healthy.

  * CAC payback period: months it takes to earn back the acquisition spend.

  * Cumulative cash flows: show when you turn profitable per customer.

6\. Stress-test scenarios

Why this matters

  * Investors use this as a quick sanity check.

  * It forces you to confront pricing, churn, and acquisition head-on.

  * A business with shaky unit economics will break no matter how good the growth story sounds.

plug in your numbers, and run 3 scenarios: best case, expected case, worst
case. You’ll instantly see whether your idea scales or needs fixing.
