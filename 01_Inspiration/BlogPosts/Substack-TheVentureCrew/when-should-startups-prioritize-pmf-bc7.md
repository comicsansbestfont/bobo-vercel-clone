##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

(PMF Score - Product market fit score & NPS - Net Promoter Score)

One of the common mistakes seen with NPS (Net Promoter Score) is that it is
used at the wrong time by most of the founders. Combine this with the fact
that it is also a lagging indicator and you get not only misrepresented
information but you get it, way, way too late. But there is a simple way to
help you make it more effective.

**Enter Product Market Fit Score**

PMF score simply measures how well your product is meeting your users’ needs.

To use it, ask your users how disappointed they’d be if they couldn’t use your
product anymore and give them the options of “Very”, “Somewhat”, and “Not at
all”

You want over 40% of qualified responses to pick “Very” — that’s an indicator
that you’re meeting the core needs of enough users to start hitting actual
PMF, which is notoriously tough to measure.

For example -

In 2007, Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape and a prominent venture
capitalist, [made a
statement](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html) that has become
a central criticism of the PMF (Product/Market Fit) score.

“You can always feel product/market fit when it’s happening. The customers are
buying the product just as fast as you can make it—or usage is growing just as
fast as you can add more servers. Money from customers is piling up in your
company checking account. You’re hiring sales and customer support staff as
fast as you can.”

Basically, you’ll KNOW when you hit PMF without needing a survey to tell you.
But the PMF score is still useful as an indicator, before you hit PMF, of
whether you’re trending towards it or not. If 28% of responses last month were
“Very” but this month it’s 31%, keep doing what you’re doing.

Also — the PMF score was originally created by **[Sean
Ellis](https://twitter.com/SeanEllis?utm_source=houck.news&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pmf-
score-vs-nps)** , the former Head of Growth at Dropbox who’s also founded
multiple startups that were eventually acquired.

This may seem obvious, but the PMF score is most useful when you’re actively
trying to find PMF (either in the early stages of a new idea, or when you’re
navigating a pivot).

But this doesn’t only mean in the early days of your startup.

Another, often overlooked point about PMF score is that you should only care
about responses given by people who have used your product recently and more
than once.

A PMF score from a new user who’s only gone through your signup flow is
useless (and not filtering those out can skew the results).

If they haven't experienced the core value proposition recently and more than
once, use a discovery survey instead. Include a call-to-action for customer
interviews to understand why they signed up. A signup shows the "what"
(quantitative), but not the "why" (qualitative).

If they answer "somewhat" or "not at all" disappointed, don't give up. Segment
them into groups and dig into why by interviewing them, and looking at
referral sources, to understand why the value proposition isn't resonating.

On the other hand, Net Promoter Score (NPS) measures how likely customers are
to recommend you and classifies users as Promoters (9-10), Passives (7-8), or
Detractors (0-6) based on their responses. A higher percentage of Promoters
indicates stronger customer loyalty. If they do recommend it, it drives growth
and saves on paid marketing costs.

For Example -

There is much debate on what a good NPS score is depending on the industry,
but basically, you are looking at the following calculation:

**% PROMOTERS - % DETRACTORS = NPS**

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cR0i!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-
post-
media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4b85491-af69-4712-a5e0-988f818464a3_1034x686.png)
_Source: Testing Business Ideas by David Bland_

If 50% are Promoters, 30% are Passives, and 20% are Detractors, the NPS would
be 30 (50% - 20%).

Even with NPS tests, teams often face the situation of customers being
extremely likely to recommend the product, yet not being disappointed if the
product goes away, resulting in an awkward silence.

This situation happens all too frequently because we aren’t using the
appropriate forms of customer research in the correct sequence. You also need
to go way beyond surveys but I digress. **You can solve this issue only by
asking NPS after you’ve found product market fit,** which you can help
diagnose using the Sean Ellis Test.

If customers recently experienced your core value, use the Sean Ellis Test for
fit. If they're not disappointed if your product went away, find out why. If
disappointed, use a Net Promoter Score survey later to see if they'd recommend
it.

If likely to refer, make it easy with referral programs and make them product
ambassadors.

With tweaks to sequencing experiments and discovery, you'll understand
customers better.

Nobody wants customers who don't care if your product goes away, but will
still recommend it to friends.

So Overall:

  * **PMF** : Most useful when seeking product-market fit, especially in the early stages or during pivots.

  * **NPS** : Suitable for measuring customer satisfaction and loyalty at any stage of product development.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

If you're raising venture capital, one of the first questions investors will
ask is: **How big can this get?**

Yet, many founders struggle to present their TAM, SAM, and SOM in a way that
resonates with investors. So let’s break down a simple framework to help you
do it right.

Why is this important? Because VCs aren’t just looking for great
businesses—they’re looking for unicorns. **They need to believe your startup
can deliver a 50x or even 100x return.**

And to achieve that, you need more than just a great idea or solid traction.

You need a market big enough to support billion-dollar growth. Let’s dive in.

Your Total Addressable Market (TAM) is the absolute biggest version of your
opportunity—the theoretical ceiling for your business. It answers the
question:

> If we captured every single customer in our space, how big could this be?

For example, if you’re building a ride-sharing app, your TAM would be the
total amount of money spent on transportation globally. That’s a massive
number, easily in the hundreds of billions.

But here’s where many founders slip up—simply Googling "TAM for X industry"
and throwing out a number doesn’t cut it.

Investors want to know: **How did you get that number?**

Pro Tip: Use industry reports from sources like Gartner, Statista, CB
Insights, and Clearbit to calculate your TAM. Be specific about your
assumptions.

VCs love seeing **TAMs measured in tens or hundreds of billions** because
they’re swinging for the fences. They don’t invest for 2x or 10x
returns—they’re aiming for companies that could IPO or get acquired for
billions.

That’s why startups in tiny niche markets often struggle to raise VC. If your
market isn't VC-scale, consider raising from angel investors instead, who may
be fine with smaller but profitable businesses.

One last thing—sometimes, startups create their market. This is what companies
like Vinovest (wine investment) or Airbnb (short-term home rentals) did. If
you’re taking this path, be ready to explain why this new market will be huge
and how you plan to create demand.

While TAM is all about vision, Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) is about
execution.

> Who can we realistically reach right now, given our current resources and
> strategy?

Sticking with our ride-sharing example:

  * Your TAM might include every person who needs transportation globally.

  * Your SAM might be urban smartphone users in Canada—a much smaller, yet still multi-billion-dollar market.

This is where VCs want to see focus. A startup trying to capture the entire
global market from day one is unrealistic. But launching in a high-density,
high-spending market, proving traction, and then expanding? That’s smart
growth.

Many successful startups start with a hyper-focused SAM before expanding
outward. Think:

  * Uber began in San Francisco.

  * Airbnb targeted conferences and events in major cities.

  * Amazon started with just books.

The key? Show that even your initial market is large enough to build a
valuable business—and that you have a roadmap for expansion.

Clarity is everything. Here’s a simple way to frame it in your pitch:

  * **Start with TAM:** "The global ride-sharing market is projected to reach $220 billion by 2025."

  * **Narrow it down to SAM:** "We're initially targeting urban areas in Canada, a $5 billion market."

  * **Show your expansion plan:** "Once we prove our model, we’ll expand to major U.S. cities, growing our SAM to $50 billion within three years."

Make sure to back up every number with solid data. Investors will ask where
you got them from, so always have your sources ready.

If possible, use visuals—a simple market-size pyramid or TAM → SAM → SOM
(Serviceable Obtainable Market) funnel can make your case much clearer.

When it comes to raising VC money, **market size matters—a lot**.

The sweet spot? Ambition + realism. Investors love big markets, but they also
want to see a clear, achievable path to getting there.

So, next time you pitch, don’t just throw out a massive TAM number and call it
a day. Show your work, make your case, and prove you’re building in a market
big enough to create a billion-dollar company.
