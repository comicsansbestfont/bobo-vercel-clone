##### **FROM OUR PARTNER**

Data Engineering is no longer just a backstage player but is taking centre
stage in the VC space.

It is about constructing and maintaining the architectures (think databases,
large-scale processing systems) that allow for data availability—a cornerstone
for insightful analysis and well-informed decisions.  

**Turning raw data into usable outputs and insights** has great use cases for
deal sourcing, due diligence, or portfolio monitoring.

##### **TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

In November 1999, PayPal founded the Product Market Fit (PMF) - When it
identified a clear and urgent pain point for a large and growing market:
online payments, particularly focusing on eBay users who needed a convenient
way to pay and get paid for their online auctions.

The company's growth skyrocketed after it dropped other plans and went all-in
on the eBay use case, with the number of users increasing from less than
10,000 at the end of 1999 to 5 million by the summer of 2000.

This is a result of **PayPal's sharp startup strategy** , which still works
today. So, let's deep dive into this strategy and understand how PayPal used
this strategy to Find PMF.

Whereas the average startup launches a bunch of features for a bunch of use
cases to appeal to many possible users, the Sharp Startup focuses on a few
killers features for the most desperate customer segment. In short, it finds a
wedge in the market.

> The Sharp Startup focuses on the most desperate customer segment. It finds a
> wedge into the market.

While it’s important to have a larger vision, the Sharp Startup remains
opportunistic and agile enough that when it spots this kind of opening in the
market, it drops everything else and drives all of its troops through it.

David Sacks, who was leading product at Paypal, shared the story of how Paypal
found product-market fit -

“It was November of 1999 when one of their customer service rep forwarded him
an email from an eBay power seller. The eBay seller had turned the PayPal logo
into a nice-looking button for her auctions and was asking PayPal’s permission
to use it.

The irony of this situation was, that this email was forwarded not because of
product reasons but because of legal reasons as David Sacks was handling
companies’ legal affairs owning to his degree in law from Stanford. It was a
potential trademark infringement question. Anyhow, he brought up this email to
Luke Nosek (co-founder of PayPal, then CMO of PayPal). They said and I quote
(from notes shared by Dave in his blog)

> It seemed extraordinary that an eBay seller had taken the time to create her
> own PayPal auction button. If she cared that much, how many others did too?

**PayPal did what great companies do. They captured the opportunity and tested
the found product market fit…**

They went to the eBay website and searched for ‘PayPal’. Hundreds of auctions
appeared in the search results because PayPal was mentioned in the item
description as a possible method of payment. **This was the AHA! moment** and
PayPal found its product-market fit. Even more interesting to learn is their
plan to implement and capture this moment.

In the meantime, Luke had come up with the signup-referral program. Now see
how PayPal productized this idea. They told auctioneers, they were free to use
the PayPal logo, in-fact PayPal created a nice logo for them and even inserted
it in their auctions, and on top of that gave $10 for every referral (more on
referral in the next chapter).

This spread like wildfire in a tight-knit eBay community. Soon, most of the
auctions were advertising PayPal. They dropped all other plans and went full
steam with this idea. Soon they reached 10,000 users by the end of 1999. By
early 2000, they had 100,000 users.

A few months after that they reached a million and by the summer of 2000, they
had 5M users. **The growth curve looked like a perfect hockey stick.** ”

**It was a classic Sharp strategy** : Paypal identified the most desperate
customer segment, went all-in on their use case, and found ways to turbo-
charge the adoption.

Notably, many of the key features were distribution tricks, not just product
enhancements. As a result, PayPal captured the key beachhead market of the
nascent online payments space, ahead of its many competitors.

You might be thinking - Paypal got lucky in this! Agree they got lucky for not
sending the customer service email to the spam folder.

But you can use this strategy to find PMF for your startup, how? By -

  * Focusing on solving a specific problem for a specific market.

  * Leveraging their competitive advantage and network effect.

  * Being flexible and adaptable to changing market conditions.

That’s It.

##### **TODAY’S QUICK DIVE**

Limited partners (LPs) are disappointed with the low capital returns from
venture managers, impacting their willingness to reinvest. In 2023,
**distributions to LPs** as a percentage of mature funds' net asset values
**hit a 14-year low at 32%** , according to
[PitchBook](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/vc-cash-distributions-
sink-14-year-low).

[Laura Thompson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauragthompson22/) from Sapphire
Partners emphasizes the importance of a strong DPI metric during such times.
LPs need robust cash distributions to fuel new VC funds, but the current
environment, **marked by the lowest DPI in over a decade,** **complicates
fundraising for venture managers.** The potential for an improved IPO market
offers hope, but until then, VCs with low DPI may turn to selling stakes in
the secondary market to navigate the challenging landscape.

Recent data from
[Carta](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peterjameswalker_cartadata-startups-
founders-activity-7155605104518152194-VL14/), encompassing over 18,000
companies, challenges the notion that startup success requires cofounders.

  * Solo founders make up 27% of all companies on Carta, dropping to 20% excluding pre-seed. Notably, consumer startups show the highest sustained share of solo founders. 

  * In Series C, larger founding teams are more common, constituting about 15% of Series D companies. 

  * However, the data indicates that solo founder-led companies, comprising 27% in total, are a viable path, challenging the universal need for cofounders in the startup landscape. The reasons for varying team sizes remain unclear, leaving room for interpretation.

In a study of 15,000+ post-money SAFEs signed in 2023 for US companies by [Carta](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7162855563205226496/), round size was found to be the primary factor determining valuation caps. Medians for round size | valuation cap:

  * Under $250K | $5M val cap 

  * $250K-$499K | $7M val cap 

  * $500K-$999K | $9M val cap 

  * $1M-$2.4M | $12M val cap 

  * $2.5M-$4.9M | $19M val cap 

  * $5M+ | $30M val cap

This highlights the widespread use of SAFEs across various funding rounds and
cautions against blindly using multiple valuation caps, which could lead to
significant dilution for founders.

##### **FEATURED POST**

For Founders, you’re raising money from people who have ‘Asymmetric
Information.’ **As an entrepreneur, it can feel as intimidating** as going to
buy a car where the dealer knows the price of every make & model of a car and
you’re guessing how much to pay.

Of course, unlike cars, there is no direct comparison across each startup so
**these are just some general guidelines** I tried to cover:

  1. What Expectations Do You Have About Valuation?

  2. What Was The Post Money On Your Last Round And How Much Capital Have You Raised?

  3. The “How much have you raised?”

  4. When SHOULD You Name A Valuation Expectation?

  5. Turning The Information Tables..… **[Read More Here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sahilsr_how-to-talk-about-valuation-numbers-when-activity-7162343504998789120-b_HB/)**

##### **TWEET OF THIS WEEK**

Historically, access to top-performing managers was considered the most
important factor in building a successful venture capital allocation—so much
so that venture capital was sometimes jokingly referred to as an “access
class.”

This was largely due to the higher persistence of performance of venture
capital managers compared with other asset classes, driven by factors such as
information asymmetry, access to proprietary deal flow, smaller fund sizes
relative to other asset classes and path-dependence stemming from successful
past investments… **[Read More Here](https://www.stepstonegroup.com/news-
