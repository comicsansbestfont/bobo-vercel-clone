##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

A lot of pitch decks I review have a slide that really shouldn’t be there: the
exit strategy slide.

Your slide deck should only have an exit strategy slide if you’re running a
very late-stage company that’s about to IPO, and even then, you probably
wouldn’t have it as a slide on a funding deck but as a whole, separate IPO
plan. **As an early-stage startup, it’s downright nonsensical, and it
shouldn’t be part of your pitch deck at all.**

To a lot of founders, an exit — or a “liquidity event,” as the legal buffs
tend to refer to it — is the big pot of gold at the end of a very long and
arduous journey. The same goes for investors; when there’s an acquisition or a
public listing, that’s how everyone gets paid.

Moreover, some of the old pitch deck templates that are floating around on the
internet have an exit strategy slide on them, so it makes sense that people
are still making this mistake.

Two things are true:

  * One is that the best companies are bought, not sold. It’s unlikely that you know in advance exactly who will be interested in buying your company.

  * Second, your job as a founder is to build the best company you possibly can.

Making decisions early on to help shape the company into something someone
might want to buy simply doesn’t make sense; it makes you blind to some of the
other options and opportunities that might present themselves.

Unless you’ve had a ton of exits with previous companies, the truth is that
you probably have a very limited view of how this process works and how
liquidity events come to pass. Do you know who has been through quite a few of
those, though? Experienced investors.

Using your precious pitching time to explain to your investors something in
which they have more expertise and better market insight than you do is a
waste of your time.

A better place to focus your attention is your competition slide. If you do
have thoughts about who a potential acquirer might be, it might make sense to
include them here. Is there an incumbent or a large competitor who can’t beat
you, so they might have to invite you to join them?

The other thing to keep in mind is that if you try to predict how an exit is
going to play out, you’re extremely likely to be wrong. Hilariously, I’ve seen
startups try to predict who might buy them, and they ended up being right but
for completely the wrong reasons, which made the startups make some daft
mistakes in the early product decisions they made.

If you do include an exit slide, the best-case scenario is that you’ll have
thought of all the same things as your investors have. In that case, pat on
the back, well done. Except you haven’t moved the conversation forward. Worst
of all, this rarely happens.

Instead, what I see from time to time are startups that introduce exit
scenarios that don’t make sense to your would-be investor. They’ll either
challenge you on them (which is a waste of precious time) or they’ll make a
mental note that you don’t know your market and be less likely to invest as a
result.

In a nutshell, the truth is that you just don’t know. **At the earliest stages
of a company, your exit is likely to be a decade away.** In that decade,
you’ll learn more about the competitive landscape, your customers and the
market dynamics than you’ll ever imagine today.

The final point worth considering is the way that venture capital works in the
first place. Especially with inexperienced founders, VCs often lose money when
a company exits too early. Selling for $10 million might sound awesome to a
founder, but a VC is looking for a startup that might potentially return an
entire fund. If they invest $5 million for 20% of the company, they’ll want
the option to get a $50 million return. ,

If they still own 20% of the company at that point (unlikely, given dilution
and later rounds, but let’s keep it simple), the company needs to sell for _at
least_ $250 million to turn that $5 million investment into a fund-returning
exit.

Put simply, investors don’t want to hear that you’re thinking about exits at
the earliest stages of your startup — it suggests that you might be willing to
accept a small return or exit early. Put it out of your mind; it’s not part of
the conversation at this stage.

Removing the exit slide from your deck means that at least you’re not the
person who brings it up. **But what do you do when an investor asks?**

> There’s only one correct answer: “I am building this company to eventually
> IPO. If reasonable acquisition offers come in, I’ll take them to my board
> for discussion.”

That does two things:

One, you show that you understand that this isn’t just about your bank
balance, but that there are a lot of stakeholders involved with an exit. Two,
it shows that you’re open to having a dialogue with your investors about a
potential liquidity event, so they can at least speak their piece when the
time comes.

We’ve also built multiple guides and frameworks that can be helpful to early-
stage founders:

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Emergence has been investing in Industry Cloud software for over 15 years,
backing companies like Veeva Systems (2008), Doximity (2011), and Federato
(2022). Their belief remains the same: “Startups that go deep in one vertical
build stronger customer loyalty and longer-lasting businesses.”

Now, with the rise of AI—particularly large language models (LLMs)—Emergence
sees a new wave of opportunity across all Industry Cloud sectors. Financial
services, they argue, may be one of the most promising areas of all.

**Why Financial Services?**

The sector is rich in structured and unstructured data, heavily regulated, and
rapidly digitizing. Platforms like Plaid, Codat, Finch, and Argyle are fueling
this shift—creating ideal conditions for a new wave of AI-first fintech
startups.

**Their Framework for Identifying AI Opportunities**

To identify where AI could have the most impact, Emergence broke the financial
services industry into major categories:

Within each, they zoomed in on specific functions—like insurance underwriting
or fraud monitoring—to evaluate where AI can drive the most value. Then, they
ranked opportunities based on three criteria:

1\. **Incremental AI Unlock -** How much can AI improve the actual job-to-be-
done?  
Take underwriting: Could an LLM (Large Language Model, like GPT) help a
startup CEO secure cyber insurance faster _and_ help the underwriter make
smarter, faster decisions?

2\. **Urgency of Customer Pain -** Is this problem keeping you up at night?  
Urgent problems often have faster sales cycles and a stronger willingness to
pay. One example is fraud, which is only getting worse as bad actors start
using AI themselves. The pain is growing, and solutions are badly needed.

3\. **Function Risk Tolerance-** What happens if the AI gets it wrong?  
Some areas—like KYC (Know Your Customer), AML (Anti-Money Laundering), or
compliance—carry enormous consequences if done poorly. Others, like
personalized product offers or customer support, are more forgiving.

> _“Low risk tolerance” means the buyer will move slowly—they want proof,
> accuracy, trust. But high-risk functions can still be great opportunities if
> you build the right solution._

_Note:_ Sometimes, the most painful problems (like compliance) also carry the
highest risk, which can slow down adoption—but still be massive opportunities
for startups that build trust.

**Near-Term Areas Ripe for AI Innovation**

Emergence highlighted five areas where AI is already starting to make waves:

  1. **Fraud (KYC, KYB, AML, Monitoring, Compliance)**

AI can help risk teams better handle unstructured data and spot fraudulent
behavior faster. As fraudsters use generative AI for social engineering, next-
generation fraud detection tools are needed. Startups in this space include
Sardine, Alloy, Oscilar, and Sandbar.

  2. **Accounting**

AI improves transaction categorization, anomaly detection, and financial
reporting. New tools like Ramp Intelligence, Numeric, and Basis are showing
how AI can streamline finance workflows.

  3. **Insurance**

Insurance is highly data-driven, making it ideal for AI across:

  * _Underwriting:_ Tools like Federato and Taktile use AI to support decision-making.

  * _Claims:_ Companies like Hi Marley, Tractable, and EvolutionIQ are reducing processing time and fraud.

  * _Distribution:_ AI is enabling hyper-personalized policies and outreach strategies.

  4. **Payment Risk**

LLMs can better understand transaction metadata, improving risk detection in
real-time payments. Startups like Slope, Sardine, Spade, and Coris.ai are
already deploying models to reduce fraud and chargebacks.

  5. **Financial Research**

LLMs can scan and synthesize huge amounts of financial data—from SEC filings
to news articles—faster than humans. AI-first research startups include
Hebbia, Brightwave, Brox, Fintool, Quill, Portrait Analytics, Alphawatch, and
Stratosphere.

**Open Questions for Builders**

As AI becomes more deeply embedded in financial services, Emergence calls out
a few open questions worth considering:

  * Infra readiness: Will demand grow for data providers like Plaid, Codat, and Finch?

  * Trust: How will AI tools prove they’re accurate, fair, and transparent?

  * Privacy vs. personalization: Can you personalize financial services without crossing ethical lines?

  * Regulation: What guardrails will regulators put in place? How will startups adapt?

The future of AI in finance won’t be built on hype. It’ll be built by founders
who understand the real pain and apply AI to solve it—with care, precision,
and trust.

If you're thinking about building in this space, now’s a rare moment where the
technology is ready, the market is waking up, and the need is urgent.

This is a rare moment where the tech is ready, the market is waking up, and
the need is urgent. If you are building in any of these spaces, I would highly

Let’s be honest — the founder journey is often romanticized. But the reality?
It’s messy, unpredictable, and deeply personal.

[Sam Corcos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samcorcos/), co-founder and CEO of
Levels, recently[ opened ](https://review.firstround.com/newsletter/)up about
how he spent 17,784 hours over 5 years building his company — and he has the
receipts to prove it. He tracked every 15-minute block of his time.

What did he find? Most of the assumptions we have about what it means to be a
founder — from burnout to management to strategy — are either misleading or
flat-out wrong.

Here’s what you _should_ know if you're building something or thinking about
starting.

**Burnout Isn’t About Hours:**

Sam regularly clocked 50 to 110 hours a week — and still didn’t feel burnt
out. Why?

Because the hours weren’t the problem.

> "Burnout is more tightly tied to energy-draining work than the number of
> hours you clock."

He learned that you can work fewer hours and still feel depleted if those
hours are spent on misaligned, low-leverage tasks.

So it’s not about working less — it’s about working on what matters to you and
to the company. Audit your energy, not just your calendar.

**Stay Close to the Product:**

In the early days, Sam was hands-on in the code. But as the team grew, he
stepped back — trusting ops, product, and engineering leads to take over.

That distance nearly cost the company its product velocity and team clarity.

Eventually, he re-immersed himself in the engineering process, rewrote their
approach, and anchored the team around **hypothesis-driven development** —
something inspired by the scientific method and _The Lean Startup_.

Even if you’re not shipping code, stay close to how value is being delivered.
When founders disconnect from the product, momentum stalls — fast.

**Kill the Calendar Creep:**

As the team scaled, Sam’s direct reports tripled — but his time spent on
management? Barely changed.

How?

  * He deleted all recurring 1:1s.

  * Created shared docs for async updates.

  * Only met when actual decisions were needed.

> **"More people doesn’t have to mean more meetings — if your systems are
> tight.”**

Meetings should be for movement, not maintenance. Over-communicate in writing.
Align through clarity, not calendar invites.

**Protect Time to Think:**

Looking at five years of data, Sam only spent 5% of his time on strategy — not
because it wasn’t a priority, but because real thinking requires space.

So he built in quarterly Think Weeks — no meetings, no distractions, just deep
writing and reflection. And it changed the trajectory of Levels multiple
times.

Your startup’s direction won’t come from inbox zero. You need a protected,
structured space to zoom out and rethink. Don’t treat strategy like a luxury —
treat it like a recurring obligation.

**Investor Updates > Deck Design:**

Sam didn’t spend months polishing pitch decks. Instead, he focused on building
a solid business and sending honest, data-rich monthly updates to investors —
whether he was raising or not.

That steady cadence turned future raises into warm conversations, not cold
pitches.

You don’t build relationships at the moment you need money — you build them
with consistency, trust, and clarity well in advance.

**Family Doesn’t Kill Output — It Refines It:**

Over these five years, Sam got married and became a father. His work hours
dropped from 90–110/week to 50–60.

But he didn’t feel less productive. He just stopped doing low-leverage work.

> "Productivity isn’t about how many hours you put in — it’s about how
> intentionally you spend the hours you have.

Big life changes don’t kill your founder capacity — they help you prioritize
better. Let them.

**The Next 5 Years: Less About** _**How**_**You Work, More About** _**Why**_

Tracking every 15-minute block of time didn’t give Sam a magic productivity
formula. It gave him _honesty_.

It made it painfully clear when his time wasn’t aligned with company needs —
or his own values.

And that’s the point.

> **“The real job of a founder isn’t just building — it’s choosing. Choosing
> how to spend your time. And defending those choices.”**

**TL;DR – If You’re a Founder, Remember This:**

  * Burnout comes from energy-draining work, not long hours.

  * Don’t give up product ownership too soon — stay close.

  * Meetings aren’t mandatory. Decisions are.

  * Strategy needs protected time, not just spontaneous thoughts.

  * Investor relations are built slowly, long before a raise.

  * Life outside work will force better prioritization — lean into it.

  * Track your time if you want truth, not just optimization.

If you’re early in the journey, let this be a prompt: Are you spending your
time on what moves the needle — or just what screams the loudest?

I highly recommend adding [this write-
up](https://review.firstround.com/newsletter/#:~:text=Subject%3A-,17%2C784%20hours%3A%20Exactly%20how%20one%20startup%20founder%20spent%205%20years%20building,-This%20week%2C%20we%E2%80%99re)
to your weekend reading, it’s totally worth reading.

An investor’s job doesn’t stop at writing a check—it’s about returning capital
to LPs. But one of the toughest, highest-stakes calls a fund manager has to
make? _Knowing when to sell._

Markets shift fast. Valuations fluctuate. Public comps crash. Sentiment turns.
That shiny paper markup can fade quickly. It's why timing exits is one of the
hardest parts of a venture.

Recently, the team at Weekend Fund (founded by Ryan Hoover) pulled together
insights from seasoned VCs who’ve been navigating these decisions for over a
decade. I found it incredibly useful, especially for emerging fund managers,
so I’m sharing a few standout lessons below, along with my own take.

Fred Wilson sums it up best:

> “Your returns will have as much to do with selling as buying. And buying is
> a fairly rational decision. Selling tends to be emotional. And that is why
> selling is the hardest part of investing.”

Here’s how top managers approach the sell decision:

**Harry Stebbings 20VC**

Harry sees selling as a fiduciary duty—and a tool to de-risk while keeping
upside exposure. For consumer companies in particular, he favors leaning out
along the way.

> “The best don’t just lean in. They lean out opportunistically. I often aim
> to sell 30–50% of a position, return the fund, then ride the rest.
> Especially in consumer and consumer social—those categories have shorter
> hype cycles than enterprise.”

**Hunter Walk Homebrew**

Hunter has one of the more structured approaches. Every time a portfolio
company raises, he decides whether he’s a buyer or seller.

> “We don’t always transact, but we always take a stance. What matters is
> being honest about what makes sense _for our fund strategy_. And when
> there’s a misalignment between what’s good for the company and what’s good
> for us, we address it head-on—transparently.”

He adds:

  * Never reprice the company on your own.

  * Never bring in problematic buyers just to get liquidity.

  * Know when alignment breaks—and be ready to act accordingly.

**Semil Shah Haystack**

Semil doesn’t follow a rigid selling strategy but emphasizes case-by-case
decision-making and founder trust.

> “Execution is way harder than the Twitter threads make it seem. Selling
> privately requires warm relationships—with founders, the board, buyers, and
> often brokers. The founder has to trust that your sale won’t spook others or
> create noise.”

**Sheel Mohnot**

Sheel uses funds from multiple targets to trigger partial exits—returning
capital early where possible and being mindful of market timing.

> “If a company hits 3x our fund, we try to sell 1/3 and return 1x the fund.
> Market context matters too—we recently returned capital at 25x in a bear
> market, and it built tremendous goodwill with LPs.”

**Paige Craig Outlander Fund**

Paige brings a data-driven process to selling. From fund formation, he sets
liquidity expectations and tracks FMV quarterly.

> “We show LPs the IRR tradeoffs of selling today vs holding. We also keep an
> active list of verified secondary buyers, so when we decide to sell, we’re
> not scrambling.”

**Chad Byers Susa Ventures**  
Chad separates his strategy into two buckets: private and public shares.

> “For private, we tend to hold winners. In a power law game, they move the
> needle. For public shares, our model is: sell 1/3 on lockup expiry, 1/3 six
> months later, and 1/3 at our discretion. That first third locks in a win;
> the rest gives flexibility.”

**So how do you actually sell?** Execution is its own challenge. Here are four
options, with tradeoffs to keep in mind:

**1\. Secondary Brokers & Marketplaces (e.g., Forge, Hiive) - **Best for hot
companies with real inbound.

  * Pros: Aggregate demand, streamline legal/ops, get market feedback.

  * Cons: Price discovery is tricky outside a fundraise; buyers may be hidden at first; fees can be high; clearance needed from company.

**2\. Secondary Funds (e.g., 137 Ventures) -** Great if you have relationships
and they already hold positions in the company.

  * Pros: Fewer fees, easier diligence, smoother company approval.

  * Cons: Limited price competition; requires pre-existing trust; still needs founder/board approval.

**3\. Investors in the Next Round -** Ideal during or around a new funding
event.

  * Pros: Clear pricing, often easier to get buy-in from company.

  * Cons: You’re tied to funding cycles, which dry up in tough markets.

**4\. AngelList LP Transfers-** For funds/SPVs on AngelList that want to give
LPs liquidity but keep upside.

  * Pros: Clean execution, vetted buyers, legal/ops handled.

  * Cons: Only for AngelList funds; doesn’t count toward DPI.

There’s no single right way to approach exits. But avoiding the
conversation—or delaying it indefinitely—can hurt both fund performance and
founder relationships. Build your own playbook. Communicate early. Be
transparent with all stakeholders.
