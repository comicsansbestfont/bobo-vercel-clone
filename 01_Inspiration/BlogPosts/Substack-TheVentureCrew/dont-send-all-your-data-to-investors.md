Recently, I had a chat with a startup founder who successfully secured $10
million in funding for his consumer tech startup. He shared some fund-raising
advice that flies directly in the face of what most conventional wisdom will
tell you.

In this article, I want to pass along the wisdom he shared and highlight
common mistakes many founders make when raising funds.

By the end, I hope to show you why his approach is worth considering. Now,
let's jump into the main ideas he talked about.

> _**Request to investors:** If you have any counterintuative point on this -
> feel free to share in the comment!_

`“Data rooms are where fund-raising processes go to die.”`

“ Let me give you more context on this - that founder shared with me!

When you raise money from investors you **produce information** that you are
told they want and care about:

  * **A fund-raising deck** that articulates your company strategy, plans, team, market, competitors and so forth.

  * **A detailed financial model** that shows your anticipated revenue, costs and profits (Income Statement) as well as your balance sheet and cash flow statements.

  * **Your historical trading** information including financials and a “customer file” which shows the history of your transactions so that investors can run “cohort” analyses

  * Customer reference, personal references, key team members, compensation, cap table, stock option plan, etc.

  * Or if you’re a VC raising from LPs you have to list all of your deals, your investment value, your carrying value, your multiples, your IRRs, TVPIs, DPIs, etc along with net cashflows plus your previous LPAs.

These collective sets of documents form the basis of what somebody looking at
investing would call **“financial due diligence.”**

**Getting the first meeting with a VC isn’t easy** because each partner at a
VC firm gets so many requests for meetings that he/she couldn’t possibly take
them all so they tend to prioritize people that were introduced from high-
quality sources - Reality…..

But it’s true that - If you’ve got the skills to be a strong entrepreneur then
it shouldn’t be too difficult to find people who know a partner at a VC firm
and if you can build a relationship with them you can get introduced. I also
like to say that while getting a first meeting isn’t easy, it also isn’t
_**that**_ hard.

**Getting follow-on meetings is very hard** because if the VC wasn’t totally
persuaded in the first pitch meeting they aren’t likely to want to commit more
time. So what does a VC do when he or she isn’t ready to say “no” or perhaps
might like to talk with you in a year but not now? **Often they ask for access
to your “data room”** so they can do an analysis on whether this would be a
good investment for them or not.

**‘Most entrepreneurs (and VCs raising from LPs) think this means progress. It
doesn’t.** ’ **The data room is where your process goes to die.**

What happens is that 18–20 firms access the data room and download all of your
documents. You feel proud because data rooms have tracking on them so you know
exactly who did and who did not access your data. So you sit around and wait
for the next call. You convince yourself that it should take 1–2 weeks until
they have gone through the data and you’ll get a call but it never comes.

**Why?**

There are a set of reasons VCs and LPs ask for data and I’m not sure they even
always internalize these reasons themselves. I’m going to **start with the
reasons and then explain how to use your best data to your advantage.**

  1. VCs (and LPs) sometimes ask for data because **they don’t know what else to do in the process.** They don’t have a compelling reason to tell you “no” based on a meeting but they aren’t prepared to meet you again. Asking for the data room is the easiest way to get off the hook for a few weeks while seemingly making progress. They aren’t doing this viciously — they might not even realize that this is why they ask for the data room. But I assure you it plays a big role.

  2. VCs (and LPs) **have a vested interest in having more data** , whether they want to invest in your company/firm or not. If a VC meets with 40 eCommerce companies and has the data room on all of them (downloaded onto his or her system) then when they DO finally dig in on an investment opportunity they can compare information such as CACs, LTVs, churn rates, margins, etc. against a broad range of similar companies. LPs also do this to VCs so that they get a broad representation of returns data.

  3. Investors often **want to see your performance this year** in case you come back and look for money next year. Investors love to be able to see what you told them in forecasts in prior years and then compare it with how you actually performed. In this way, investors can make some assessments of how well they should believe your future forecasts that you are showing them a year later.

  4. **Investors often DO want to do the first pass of analysis on** your company and might genuinely have an interest. But for the most part, this analysis is done by more junior people who can always find a reason in the data to show that you suck. It’s not that they’re particularly negative but the fact is that supporting roles at investment firms are designed to show the partners the risks in deals and the “upside case” always requires huge assumptions to be believed. So junior analysis of your company is also often where initial due diligence goes to die unless you can be sure that the investment partner is also willing to engage.

No. None!

For starters, you have to realize that fundraising is a sales process.

The buyer is shopping for equity in startups and the seller is looking for
cash in exchange for equity and shared governing control of his or her
company.

`Asking too early for data room access is the equivalent of going into a store
to look at clothes, watches, cars, electronics, etc. and then asking to take a
brochure home with you. `

You are going to “study” the details before making a decision. Yeah, sure. A
brochure is an easy out for you in the sales process without being rude. You
know that you theoretically MIGHT want to look at the specs of that $5,000
coffee machine one day but in reality, it’s likely to sit in a pile on your
desk.”

**The consumer tech founder said** \- “He never thought of this until became
the Founder & CEO of the startup company. He did some outbound sales &
marketing, responded to some inbound enquiries that came “over the transom”
from marketing activities and we responded to RFPs (requests for proposal). He
hired a sales coach who helped him figure out how to close more deals. The
coach told him to stop responded to RFPs where he wasn’t the person who helped
write the specs for the RFPs. The coach told him “If you didn’t help shape the
RFP somebody else did and you’ve already lost.

That was a hard pill to swallow since there were so many deals done via an
RFP. The coach didn’t think RFPs were a total waste but he said that you need
to test every potential buyer for true interest. Normally you are sent an RFP
and asked to fill out forms and send it back. If they like your response they
call you in for meetings. Coach shared that - “Responding to RFPs is where
sales processes go to die.” It felt like heresy. They asked me (the founder)
to send them info, how could I do anything else? It would be rude!?!

Sales Coach also instructed him to call the potential customer instead and ask
for a meeting. “Just tell them that you’re working on your response but to
better understand your ROI calculation and to give them a more precise offer
you need to test a few of your assumptions. You’d love a super short meeting
to do this.” He said, “If they are not willing to meet then you’re already
dead so you’re better off to spend your time with another lead. Any truly
interested buyer would give you some time to help you and improve your offer
and probably to get to know you better.”

`The sales coach taught him that the key metric to whether a sales process is
going well is “engagement.” `

If they’re giving you time then you owe them more data and if they don’t give
you time then you shouldn’t share your data. I tried it, and it worked
incredibly well meeting with people (in person, in a web conference or on the
phone) is ALWAYS better for you to understand their buyer needs and them to
better understand you.

In short, meeting in person gives you a chance to remind the prospective buyer
“why they loved you” in the first place and gives you a chance to better share
your story.

It’s the equivalent of falling in love with a Tesla in the showroom and if
they get you back in the showroom you can remember why you loved them and
wanted them and would be happy owning one. Sending the specs can’t do this.”

**VC** : “We enjoyed our meeting. Can you please send us your certificate of
incorporation, your Cap Table, your 3-year P&L and last year’s historical
trading information?

**Entrepreneur** : “Sure. No problem. We have all of that. Can we please
schedule a 15-minute call next week to quickly walk through your information
request so we can best be prepared? I promise not to run over that time
allotment.”

If “no” then you know it’s a waste to send the information. What interested
party wouldn’t even grant you 15 minutes? “Just send the information and when
we analyze it we’ll set up a call” is not good enough. If you have self-
respect you’ll say “no” to that request. And frankly, the more you say “no”
the more likely they’ll take the call and the more they say “no” the less
likely you should want to work with them.

**Entrepreneur (when on the initial call)** : “In trying to figure out how to
prioritize the information you need, I wanted to best understand your process,
what analysis would be most helpful and make sure I get it to you in the right
format.” and later, “What do you expect the next step in the process would
likely be? How should I best prepare for that?”

Your goal is to learn more about what they are trying to solve with the
information and frankly, you’re politely forcing them both to think about what
they’d actually do with it (other than ask for it) and they are starting to
make subtle commitments to reengage with you.

In the above situation, I would hope that you were able to persuade them just
to look at historical data and future forecasts because your cap table,
certificate of incorporation, reference list, etc, isn’t valid until later in
due diligence.

**Entrepreneur (post-call, now ready to share data)** : “We’ve prepared the
cohort analysis you requested and we’ll send you the raw data file, too. I
have now done our 3-year plan as monthly rather than quarterly as requested.
The model is a bit complex — I’d love the chance to come and quickly walk you
through our assumptions. It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes but it’s
important to me that you and the partner meet me so you can understand the key
drivers before I send it.”

Again, your goal is to trade data for engagement. If they prefer not to meet
(they’re rationally trying to be judicious with time) you can politely request
that perhaps you just do it on a web conference call (Xoom, Google Hangouts,
Skype, whatever.) Each interaction is an opportunity to test whether or not
they’re really doing the work and since you have to rigorously protect your
time each piece of data should be traded for engagement.

**Remember:**

> **In-Person > Web Conference > Phone Call > Email > Data Room**

If you run a good process and if the investor is truly interested (even if
busy and doesn’t respond as fast as you’d like) then each major step of
analysis on their side can be a series of documents you trade in exchange for
more proof of engagement.

Founder shared that - “I do the exact same for reference calls. Many times
I’ve been asked for the names of references only to find that they were never
called or only 1–2 were called. I love it when investors ask me for references
because I know it’s a great chance to DRIVE engagement. How?

I always ask the potential investor, “Would you mind if I contacted someone
and organised for him/her to speak with you for 20 minutes?” Most people will
say “yes” and now I know you’ve committed to further engagement with my
process which is also 20 minutes you’re not committing to somebody else’s
process. Presumably your “on sheet” references are big advocates (otherwise
you’re in real trouble) so this engagement should go well.

I often send the introduction email and then a second email to the reference
to say, “This reference is really important to me. I’d be grateful if you
could prioritize it. Thank you!” That way you have an advocate making sure the
meeting happens.

But are they just putting a customer reference list in a data room? NFW.”

There is nothing you can provide in a data room that you couldn’t send via
email. Sending the docs via email is less friction than making people come to
a data room. And if you break up your diligence documents into related sets of
information that map to different stages in the processes then you realize you
never send it all at once anyway.

I know the first time you don’t follow the customer’s “rules” for how they
want to engage it feels awkward. But remember the brochure you take at a car
dealership. And remember that unless you can break out of the traditional
process designed to put up walls you will forever be the company sitting in a
pile on the buyer’s desk in a stack of brochures.”
