Let’s deep dive into the VC Fund treadmill and understand the VC fund cycle:

**Take a close look at the below image of the timeline of the VC fund:**

Don’t get confused with the terms or complexity described in the image. I will
explain to you all the terms described in the image.

From the image, it’s clear that - the **fund life** of this VC fund is about
10 years. ( Horizontal line from Y0 to Y10)

Raising funds for a new venture capital (VC) fund is a challenging task for
General Partners (GPs) who hold higher positions. GPs typically start by
seeking investments from Limited Partners (LPs), including High Net Worth
Individuals (HNIs), Family Offices, and School endorsement funds.

Typically, it takes **approximately 2-2.5 years for new funds to secure the
total capital from LPs.** For instance, if a group of GPs aims to raise around
$50 million from LPs, the fundraising process would generally span 2-2.5
years. It's worth noting that even for lower amounts, such as $25 million, the
duration for raising the funds remains similar.

The process of raising funds for a new venture capital (VC) fund is typically
divided into two stages: the first close and the final close, as depicted in
the image. During the first close, which typically takes around 1-1.5 years,
the General Partners (GPs) aim to secure approximately 40-50% of the total
targeted fund to be raised from LPs ($50 million in this case). The remaining
portion of the funds is then raised during the subsequent 1-1.5 years, leading
up to the final close.

But what after the **first raised** (40%-50% of decided raised capital) -
**Does VC start to invest in startups / start to charge Management fees OR
wait to raise the rest of the money and then start the investment?**

Generally, after First Raised, VCs start to invest in the startups over the
commitment period which is about 3-5 years. In the **Commitment period** \-
VCs will do the fresh investment in around 10-15 startups (depending on
investment strategy). Simultaneously, VCs begin charging management fees over
the fund's lifespan. These management fees usually amount to around 1.5%-2%
annually.

“ _**But till the first raised - the VC business worked kind of a bootstrapped
startup.**_ ”

The **commitment fund** is designated for investing in newly established
startups. However, once the commitment period concludes, VCs are no longer
able to make investments in additional startups. Instead, they shift their
focus to **follow-on investments** , which typically occur around two years
after the commitment period.

The **follow-on investment phase** extends from the initial fundraising to
approximately 7-8 years into the fund's lifespan, as depicted in the image.
During this period, follow-on investments are made in the startups that were
previously invested during the commitment period.

Typically, VC funds are organized into **Fund I or Fund II,** as you
mentioned. **Fund I** is formed by combining the capital raised during the
first and final raises. However, once the commitment period concludes, VCs are
unable to invest in new startups. To avoid being unable to invest in fresh
startups, VCs initiate the process of raising funds from Limited Partners
(LPs) for Fund II. **Fund II** fundraising usually begins before the end of
the 1-1.5 year commitment period.

This cycle of raising funds and deploying them into startups forms what is
known as the **VC Treadmill, where VCs continuously seek new funds to sustain
their ability to invest and support startups.**

Raised Fund → Deployed in startups → Raised Fund → Deployed in startups

The primary responsibility of raising funds from LPs in the VC business
primarily falls on GPs or MDs. It is the GPs and MDs who handle investment
decision-making, fund operational activities, fundraising efforts for new
funds, providing support to portfolio startups, and presenting the fund's
performance to LPs. Individuals working in the VC industry can envision the
extensive workload involved in these tasks, which encompass a wide range of
responsibilities to ensure the success and growth of the fund.

That’s it. I hope you are able to understand the lifecycle of a VC fund and
the most common terms used in this space.
