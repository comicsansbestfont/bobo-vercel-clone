**You might be thinking what the f*ck is this Tarpit Idea about? Till now,
most of you heard about bad ideas,** and there is always the suggestion that
stay away from bad ideas. But ‘Tarpit Ideas’ are way worse than bad ideas.

> it. Looks scary, right?

And you know, most of the founders fall under this trap of Tarpit Idea
assuming to be a good idea and that’s where they failed to build a potentially
good company. So what’s this carpet idea about, how can the founder identify
whether they are working on the Tarpit idea? So let’s deep dive into it:

A Tarpit, in nature, is where **petroleum seeps through the Earth.** It's a
hotbed for finding fossilized remains like dinosaurs because animals mistake
the tar pits for freshwater ponds.

They step in, get stuck due to the sticky tar, and unfortunately perish. The
scent attracts more animals, creating a domino effect. **Interestingly, this
mirrors a phenomenon in the startup world**

`where some ideas lure entrepreneurs in, but the challenges and failures
cascade, trapping them in a cycle much like the unsuspecting animals in a tar
pit.`

> **Tarpits in the startup world lure founders with seemingly brilliant and
> unexplored ideas.**

The absence of famous companies tackling these issues makes them even more
attractive. It's like discovering a pristine freshwater pool that appears wide
open for success. However, beneath the surface lies a hidden danger.

Many startup founders unknowingly fall into the tarpit trap, where the
graveyard of failed attempts is not immediately apparent. **Recognizing this
trap is crucial because awareness significantly increases the probability of
your startup's success.** In essence, avoiding the allure of deceptive ideas
can be the key to steering your entrepreneurial journey toward triumph rather
than failure.

> “Consumer business involves products marketed directly to individuals, not
> companies. These can be free with ads, like social networks, or paid, as

>

People often lean towards consumer ideas because, well, we're all consumers!

From the products marketed to us throughout our lives, our problems and
interests naturally revolve around things we use or think our friends would.
**Most startup stories we hear are about consumer successes like Steve Jobs or
Mark Zuckerberg, creating a default association between startups and consumer-
focused ventures.**

Unlike the consumer realm, it's rare to find someone head over heels for
enterprise solutions like Cisco or Oracle. Essentially, our familiarity and
exposure make consumer ideas the default go-to when diving into the startup
world.

**The most interesting thing is that - most consumer-based idea seems to be so
simple but it’s really difficult to build a good startup.** There is a reason
why there is no solution now for a particular simple idea…..

It’s tough for two reasons -

**First, many underestimate the high bar set by successful consumer
products.** They often don't realize how good those products are and how many
others have tried and failed.

**Second, timing is crucial in the consumer space.** Sometimes, founders do
understand when the timing is in their favour or working against them.
Additionally, existing big players have an edge, creating an almost unfair
advantage.

For instance, imagine someone with an idea for an un-launched consumer social
network. They might believe it's groundbreaking without knowing the real
standards.

**Let's take Google as an example to understand the high bar** – it wasn't
just about launching; it was about creating something so exceptional that
users couldn't resist.

  1. **Google:**

In its early days, there **was no advertising or growth hacking – just a
website.** They relied on incredible word of mouth. Users had to manually
discover it, often through internet forums like Slashdot.

Without spending on user acquisition, branding, or marketing, Google attracted
millions of users daily. The product's quality was so high that people not
only wanted it but evangelized it.

**The founders initially weren't keen on running a startup; they even tried to
sell the technology.** However, the demand was so intense that they got pulled
into the startup world.

`This highlights a key aspect of successful consumer ideas – creating
something people are obsessed with and of exceptional quality, so much so that
users pull the founders into the journey. `

The same case with the facebook…

  2. **Facebook**

Facebook's journey mirrors Google's success. Within 48 hours of its Harvard
release, 75% of the campus was using it.

Investors like Peter Thiel and Reed Hoffman witnessed users spending an
average of two hours daily on the site.

**The striking part? No money was spent on marketing or growth hacking.**

`The truth about these iconic consumer companies is often overlooked. They
started with excited users who pulled the product themselves. Users were
passionate, even demanding the product at their universities. `

> **The lesson here is clear:** successful consumer companies have in common
> genuinely enthusiastic users. They didn't rely on aggressive marketing
> tactics but rather created products that people became obsessed with early
> on. This sets a high bar for what defines a compelling consumer idea.

If you look closely into the data…

**Making a consumer or mobile company in the mid-2000s and early 2010s was
easier due to specific circumstances.** During the 2000s, many people had
broadband and computers, and the lack of competition for attention made
launching something cool quite successful.

`For instance, Facebook gained traction without battling numerous social
networks. In the smartphone era, having an app store and the novelty of mobile
apps meant even basic creations could attract users.`

Back in college, everyone had a computer screen, and with limited TVs, people
were more engaged with computers. The absence of major web incumbents and the
dominance of TV in entertainment created a sweet spot for web-based startups.
Similarly, the early smartphone era allowed for simpler apps to thrive, unlike
today's highly competitive app landscape.

> **The key takeaway? Success often depends on being in the right place at the
> right time.**

  * **Ideas that have survivor bias:**

user problems that may look solvable from a posterior, results-oriented
perspective. For example, discovery problems help people find new restaurants
to try and new places to go.

  * **Ideas that are second-order on widely adopted innovations.**   
Innovations that have step function improvements bring many low-hanging
second-order opportunities. For example, in today's environment, a "social
network for X" might be a Tarpit Idea.

  * **Ideas that are more difficult for startups to scale.**   
For example, hardware start-ups require a lot of funding before seeing the
first results, and although they can scale eventually, they require the right
approach.

Some tarpit ideas might not be so with the right founders and business model.
At the same time, good ideas that were launched years ago might be a tarpit
idea now.

Before understanding - how can someone make a great pivot? Let’s understand a
concept called - **Supply-Demand in Founders & Ideas.**

**Some ideas attract a large pool of founders (more supply)** due to their
appeal—think partying with celebrities. On the flip side, ideas like building
open-source developer orchestration tools have a lower supply because of the
specific skills required.

**The demand side is crucial too**. Unlaunched, undifferentiated social apps
face minimal demand in a saturated market. On the other hand, there's a high
demand for high-quality software that solves significant business problems,
making companies more efficient.

`In essence, tarpit ideas refer to those with an oversupply of founders
relative to market demand. `

It's akin to the job market – having unique, differentiating skills sets you
apart. The plea here is for experienced individuals who might not see
themselves as startup material; if you've solved a niche problem or have
industry insights, you could be a startup person. The startup world isn't
limited to consumer apps or social networks; it embraces diverse perspectives
to solve real-world problems.

So if you find that you are solving the Tarpit Problem and You want to pivot
your business then follow this “Supply & Demand Rule”. How?

**The best pivots occur when a founding team recognizes the supply and demand
dynamics.**  

`It involves moving from an idea with an oversupply of founders and low
customer demand to an idea with a lower founder supply and higher customer
demand. `

Examples include Brex and Retool. Instead of heading to the easy freshwater
pond, which is a trap, successful pivots lead toward less explored areas like
the mountains or desert. It's about moving away from the common tar pit ideas
and embracing challenges.

For aspiring founders, it's crucial to do thorough research, understand the
bar for success, and consider the supply and demand aspect. Creating luck
involves recognizing these dynamics and making strategic moves to increase the
odds of success. The advice is not about claiming to have all the answers but
about sharing insights to help founders avoid common pitfalls and pave their
unique path to success.
