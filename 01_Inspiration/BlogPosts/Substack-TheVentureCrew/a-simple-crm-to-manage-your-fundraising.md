##### **📬 VENTURE CURATORS’ FINDING**

##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

**Our controversial take:** A great fundraising process is only 20% about
pitching.

The other 80% is all about organisation.

Yep, you heard that right.

Your pitch, the thing you’ve spent weeks refining and rehearsing, is only a
small part of successful fundraising.

“What the heck do y’all mean by the organisation?” - you, probably

If you’re talking to dozens (or even hundreds) of investors, keeping track of
who they are, what stage they’re at, and what you last discussed is impossible
to do from memory. That’s where an investor CRM (Customer Relationship
Management) system comes in.

Some founders use tools like HubSpot, Salesforce, or Pipedrive, but you don’t
need fancy software. A simple Google Sheet can do the job. What matters is
that it helps you track key details, follow-ups, and next steps—so no
potential investor falls through the cracks.

**Walking through an investor CRM**

This spreadsheet may look like a lot at first. But a CRM is way simpler than
you might think.

**Basic contact info**

To kick things off, add the names and email addresses of the investors that
you already know.

Then add the names and email addresses of prospective investors that you would
like to build stronger relationships with.

**Type of Investor**

In the next column, label what type of investor they are (angel investor,
venture fund, etc). This will help you tailor your messaging accordingly.

**Referrer**

The **referrer** is the person who introduced you to the investor listed in
your CRM.

So if ABC sent an email to introduce me to an investor, ABC is the referrer in
this example?  

This is crucial because your team can see where your leads are coming from.
Plus if the introduction is a mutually beneficial one, we get a chance to
reach out to the referrer again to say thanks.

Add their names in the next column and let’s keep moving.

**Stage**

What stage are they at in terms of considering an investment in your company?

These stages can be customized to your situation… but for simplicity, let’s
define the stages that most funds used during our fundraising process.

  * **Lead** – When someone offers to refer somebody new to you but you haven’t made contact yet.

  * **First Contact** – This stage is the first time you both have been able to officially engage. Someone might have sent an email introduction and they may have reciprocated back saying, “Yes, let’s meet!”

  * **First Pitch** – This is the first meeting you have with them to pitch your company.

  * **Due Diligence** – This comes after the pitch when they’re considering investing. It’s normal for investors to ask to see more materials to help them make a decision.

  * **Soft Commit** – This is when they are interested in investing and have given you a dollar amount they want to put towards your company. This is purely a verbal commitment, nothing official, but a positive sign to move them into the next stage.

  * **Signed** – This is when the confetti drops from the ceiling because you have received a full commitment from this investor. Whooot!!! 🎊

  * **Rejected and Ghosted** – These are the stages where they reject your pitch or never return your messages. But remember, it’s not over yet. There’s still an opportunity to maintain the relationship or even invite them to your [biweekly/monthly investors update](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/152011320/how-to-write-monthlybi-weekly-investors-updates-email-template). They may convert into investors down the road.

**Committed**

If they have given you a verbal commitment of a certain amount they want to
invest, include this number in the **Committed** column.

Above, you can see three investors committing a combined total of $300,000 as
an example.

**Notes**

The **Notes** section is the most critical part of the CRM.

It summarizes what you talked about during your calls or emails. Add as many
notes as you can along with the dates of each interaction.

These notes are crucial because fundraising is a team sport.

Tracking everything helps your team understand the context of the
relationship. So when they interact with this person, they know where each
investor is in the process, and can pick up right where their teammate left
off.

**Closed and Next Contact**

Next, we have a **Closed** column to show how much money you have closed.  

This is your time to celebrate your hard work being paid off. Launch the
confetti. Take out a bottle of champagne. You deserve it.  

Ok, time to get back to work. The last part of the CRM is a **Next Contact**
column. This is a reminder for yourself on when you should reach out to this
person again.  

So if you're still in the due diligence or soft commit phases, set a clear
date here on when you should follow up.  

If people have committed, we recommend getting aggressive and following up
every two or three days. This shows that you’re committed to making this work
and are certain you have given them all the materials they need to feel
unblocked on making a decision.  

For the people who have rejected or ghosted you, you should keep reaching out.  

Remember a rejection is never truly a rejection until you get a hard “no”.

So your investor CRM is a critical tool for successful fundraising.

  * All your contacts are in one place with detailed information

  * All the interactions your team has had with each person are tracked so everyone is on the same page

  * It tracks where everyone is in the fundraising process and gives reminders on when to follow up.

Start your investor CRM as soon as possible. Like, now.

There are paid CRM tools out there to track opens and clicks on emails. But to
keep things simple, we recommend starting with a basic spreadsheet.

Here’s [a
template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P5fbNrSiOo7Ty0m6vE4dvY2LZFTdhmDh/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106576900328119216380&rtpof=true&sd=true)

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Let’s be honest — the founder journey is often romanticised. But the reality?
It’s messy, unpredictable, and deeply personal.

[Sam Corcos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samcorcos/), co-founder and CEO of
Levels, recently[ opened ](https://review.firstround.com/an-exact-breakdown-
of-how-one-ceo-spent-his-first-two-years-of-company-building/)up about how he
spent 17,784 hours over 5 years building his company — and he has the receipts
to prove it. He tracked every 15-minute block of his time.

What did he find? Most of the assumptions we have about what it means to be a
founder, from burnout to management to strategy, are either misleading or
flat-out wrong.

Here’s what you should know if you're building something or thinking about
starting.

**Burnout Isn’t About Hours:**

Sam regularly clocked 50 to 110 hours a week — and still didn’t feel burnt
out. Why?

Because the hours weren’t the problem.

> "Burnout is more tightly tied to energy-draining work than the number of
> hours you clock."

He learned that you can work fewer hours and still feel depleted if those
hours are spent on misaligned, low-leverage tasks.

So it’s not about working less — it’s about working on what matters to you and
to the company. Audit your energy, not just your calendar.

**Stay Close to the Product:**

In the early days, Sam was hands-on with the code. But as the team grew, he
stepped back, trusting ops, product, and engineering leads to take over.

That distance nearly cost the company its product velocity and team clarity.

Eventually, he re-immersed himself in the engineering process, rewrote their
approach, and anchored the team around **hypothesis-driven development** ,
something inspired by the scientific method and The Lean Startup.

Even if you’re not shipping code, stay close to how value is being delivered.
When founders disconnect from the product, momentum stalls fast.

**Kill the Calendar Creep:**

As the team scaled, Sam’s direct reports tripled — but his time spent on
management? Barely changed.

How?

  * He deleted all recurring 1:1s.

  * Created shared docs for async updates.

  * Only met when actual decisions were needed.

> **"More people doesn’t have to mean more meetings if your systems are
> tight.”**

Meetings should be for movement, not maintenance. Over-communicate in writing.
Align through clarity, not calendar invites.

**Protect Time to Think:**

Looking at five years of data, Sam only spent 5% of his time on strategy, not
because it wasn’t a priority, but because real thinking requires space.

So he built in quarterly Think Weeks — no meetings, no distractions, just deep
writing and reflection. And it changed the trajectory of Levels multiple
times.

Your startup’s direction won’t come from inbox zero. You need a protected,
structured space to zoom out and rethink. Don’t treat strategy like a luxury —
treat it like a recurring obligation.

**Investor Updates > Deck Design:**

Sam didn’t spend months polishing pitch decks. Instead, he focused on building
a solid business and sending honest, data-rich monthly updates to investors,
whether he was raising or not.

That steady cadence turned future raises into warm conversations, not cold
pitches.

You don’t build relationships at the moment you need money, you build them
with consistency, trust, and clarity well in advance.

**Family Doesn’t Kill Output — It Refines It:**

Over these five years, Sam got married and became a father. His work hours
dropped from 90–110/week to 50–60.

But he didn’t feel less productive. He just stopped doing low-leverage work.

> "Productivity isn’t about how many hours you put in, it’s about how
> intentionally you spend the hours you have.

Big life changes don’t kill your founder capacity, they help you prioritise
better. Let them.

**The Next 5 Years: Less About How You Work, More About Why**

Tracking every 15-minute block of time didn’t give Sam a magic productivity
formula. It gave him honesty.

It made it painfully clear when his time wasn’t aligned with company needs —
or his own values.

And that’s the point.

> “The real job of a founder isn’t just building — it’s choosing. Choosing how
> to spend your time. And defending those choices.”

**TL;DR – If You’re a Founder, Remember This:**

  * Burnout comes from energy-draining work, not long hours.

  * Don’t give up product ownership too soon — stay close.

  * Meetings aren’t mandatory. Decisions are.

  * Strategy needs protected time, not just spontaneous thoughts.

  * Investor relations are built slowly, long before a raise.

  * Life outside work will force better prioritisation, lean into it.

  * Track your time if you want the truth, not just optimisation.

If you’re early in the journey, let this be a prompt: Are you spending your
time on what moves the needle or just what screams the loudest?

I highly recommend adding [this write-up](https://review.firstround.com/an-
exact-breakdown-of-how-one-ceo-spent-his-first-two-years-of-company-building/)
to your weekend reading, it’s totally worth reading.

As a first-time founder, you might find yourself in a similar situation -
excited about a positive response from a potential investor, but suddenly
faced with an unfamiliar term: "data room."

A data room is essentially a secure, organised collection of documents that
provides detailed information about your company. It's a tool for due
diligence, allowing potential investors to dive deep into your business's
financials, operations, and potential.

In early-stage venture deals, data rooms play a crucial role at **two distinct
stages of the investment process.**

**Stage 1: Pre-Term Sheet**

At this point, investors typically have limited information about the company,
relying mainly on the pitch deck, website, and publicly available data. They
request access to a preliminary data room to perform a quick spot check and
gather material for internal discussions with their partners.

This Stage 1 data room helps investors validate their initial interest and
prepare for more in-depth conversations about the potential investment.

Here’s a list of the 5 sections and types of content you’ll want to include in
your stage 1 data room:

  1. **Business Summary / Company Overview**

  2. **Traction / Product Market Fit**

  3. **Financials**

  * Purpose: provide a financial overview of your business from the day you started to the present day with forward-facing projections. If you don’t have a financial model built, I highly recommend you check out Sturppy. Sturppy’s is used by 4,000+ startups and allows founders to build an investor-ready financial model without being an expert on finance or financial modelling.

  * Docs to include:

    * P&L / Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cashflow Statement, Financial Projections 1-3 years in the future

  4. **Team & Roles**

  5. **Cap Table**

**Stage 2: Post-Term Sheet**

After receiving and negotiating a term sheet, you enter Stage 2 of the data
room process. This stage is crucial for streamlining due diligence before any
final agreements are signed. It's wise to create a separate, more detailed
data room for this phase, rather than just expanding your Stage 1 room. This
approach gives you better control and flexibility, especially when dealing
with multiple investors at different stages.

Here’s a list of additional sections and content you’ll want to include:

  1. **Entity Formation Documents**

  * Purpose: These documents are mostly needed by the legal team and are a set of documents used to certify your business’s good standing. These docs are going to fluctuate based on where your business is incorporated and the type of business entity you’ve chosen. If you’re a startup in the US, 9/10 if you’re raising venture, you’re going to be established as a Delaware C-Corp

  * Docs to include:

    * Shareholder certificate documents

    * Local/state/federal business licenses/letters of good standing

    * Articles of incorporation

    * Bylaws, Tax ID number, Operating agreement between founders, Shareholder meeting minutes/board minutes, Annual meeting notes/minutes

  2. **Customer & Partner Contracts**

  3. **Proof of Intellectual Property**

  * Purpose: If your company has IP and that was part of the pitch, you’re going to have to show proof of that IP. This includes patents, trademarks, copyright, and design

  * Docs to include:

  4. **Full cap table documents**

  5. **Tax Filings**

  * Purpose: Proof that your company is in good standing with the IRS

  * Docs to include: Tax History, Previous filings, Previous audit statements and any third-party financial evaluations

  6. **Information on Any Outstanding Litigation**

Also, we have created a detailed guide and included all relevant templates
that you need for your data room. All these curated with the help of startups
attorneys, VCs. You can access it here:

Founders send investor updates. VCs should treat LPs the same way.

Regular LP updates are not a formality, they’re a core part of being a
thoughtful, transparent fund manager. They help LPs understand how you’re
investing their capital, keep them engaged, and position you for stronger
relationships and future fundraising.

Ryan and Vedika from Weekend Fund break this [down
clearly](https://www.signatureblock.co/p/how-to-write-lp-updates?sd=pf): LP
updates are a moment to step out of the daily noise and reflect on the fund at
a macro level. They’re also one of the few direct ways LPs can stay close to
your thinking, learn from your activity, and meaningfully contribute.

Here’s what seasoned LPs want from updates:

  * **Start with a clear snapshot**  
Open with a summary: recent investments, major news, key movements in the
portfolio. LPs want to know what changed, fast.

  * **Show performance, with real data**  
TVPI, IRR, capital deployed, reserves remaining, capital called, include them
all. Don’t oversell. If you’re sharing a markup, it should be from a priced
round. Avoid presenting SAFE or note rounds as markups.

  * **Explain your decisions**  
When introducing new investments, go beyond surface-level detail. LPs want to
know why you invested your thesis, conviction, timing, team, and traction, and
how it fits into the market.

  * **Offer a market perspective**  
Many LPs are investing to learn. Updates are an opportunity to share what
you’re seeing: sector dynamics, early signals, experiments, or trends emerging
from the portfolio.

  * **Include clear LP asks**  
LPs are often operators or networked investors. Don’t miss the chance to ask
for help—whether it's hiring, partnerships, or intros. Specificity drives
action.

  * **Consistency builds trust**  
The biggest mistake emerging managers make is inconsistency. Set a rhythm
quarterly or bi-monthly and stick to it.

  * **Voice matters**  
Updates don’t need to be overly formal. The best ones reflect your personality
and values as a fund. Some LPs even appreciate a glimpse into your personal
life or travel plans. It humanises the relationship.

For many LPs, this is their only ongoing lens into how your fund operates.
It’s not just a report, it’s a signal of how you think, how you communicate,
and how you build long-term trust.
