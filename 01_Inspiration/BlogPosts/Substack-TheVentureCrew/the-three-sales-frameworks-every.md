##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

Sales at an early-stage startup often feel like wandering in the dark with a
flashlight that barely works. You hear a lot of vague advice: "Just hustle,"
or "Go get ‘em!" But when you’re the founder or first salesperson trying to
land those critical first customers, what you need are tactics, not
motivational quotes.

I came across an interesting post shared by [Whitney
Sales](https://www.linkedin.com/in/whitneysales/), founder of ThoughtForge,
creator of The Sales Method, and one of the sharpest sales minds. She shared
three powerful sales frameworks that I believe every founder should know and
use.

So I’m sharing some key points, along with my thoughts on them:

**Why?** Because at this stage, you are the first customer.

According to Whitney, “The inception of any company is inevitably linked to
the challenge the founder first faced and addressed. This part of the
narrative is too often forgotten, and it’s key to connecting with a customer.”

Before you’ve got fancy logos and metrics, you’ve got your pain and your
reason for building the product. Use it.

**The Exercise:** Use this simple story-building template to craft a value-
based founder narrative:

> "[SUBJECT] [ONCE UPON A TIME], [SITUATION] [CUSTOMER PROBLEM]. [CUSTOMER]
> and realized [FEATURES OF PROBLEM]. [COST]. [SUBJECT] learned [IDEATION
> PROCESS]. As a result, [SOLUTION]."

This isn’t fluff. It’s how you relate, build trust, and show the human reason
behind your product.

Example: The TalentIQ founder started his first company and lost time and
money because a recruiter couldn’t send qualified candidates fast enough. He
saw the chaos of 50 tabs open across scattered data sources, and realised
recruiters lacked one clean source of truth. That pain led to the product.

You’ve already told this story to yourself, your early hires, and maybe
investors. Tell it again, but now to your customers.

**Why?** Because the founder’s story won’t always resonate with every buyer.

Whitney says, “If you only have one customer, extract the elements of their
use case that are most relatable to your prospect. A beta customer’s story can
be as valuable as a paid customer’s story.”

This is where your product’s _real-world_ value starts to come through. It
builds credibility and defuses objections.

**→ The Exercise:** Here’s Whitney’s customer story framework:

> “One of my clients, [CUSTOMER NAME], who is in the same [QUALIFICATION
> CRITERIA], was having the same problem. When I met with their [TITLE], they
> mentioned that [CUSTOMER PAIN POINT]. [DETAIL]. We implemented [FEATURE],
> and enabled them to [BENEFIT]. They saw [RESULT].”

📌 Example: A client had onboarding emails that weren’t working users dropped
off. Whitney’s team implemented behaviour-based emails that matched user
activity. The result? 63% more conversions. $4.2M in revenue unlocked.

Even if you have just one beta user, document their story. Get specific. Then
build a bank of these stories, segmented by company size, pain point,
industry, or tech stack.

**Why?** Because stories make people open up.

Early sales aren’t about pitching features. It’s about using founder and
customer stories to get a prospect to start talking. Whitney emphasises: “The
best sign a pitch is working? The customer starts asking you questions.”

**The Structure:** Here’s her proven sales conversation flow:

Source: First Round

  1. **Start human (5–10 min):** Crack a joke. Be real. Show you’re not a robot.

  2. **Assert the agenda (2 min):** “I’d love to understand how you do ___ today, then share how we might help.”

  3. **Ask value-based questions (5–10 min):** Learn their pain points. What’s costing them time or money?

  4. **Tell a customer story (2–3 min):** Match their pain to a real use case. Share what worked.

  5. **Go deeper into ROI (5–10 min):** Tie their pain to your product’s benefits. Use their own words to frame the solution.

  6. **Decide or qualify (10+ min):** Ask about their budget, timeline, and who else needs to be involved (a.k.a. the classic BANT framework).

  7. **Lock next steps (5 min):** Don’t end the call on “we’ll be in touch.” Schedule the next meeting now.

If you’re an early-stage founder, your sales pitch is not your deck. Your real
pitch is your **founding story** and your **first customer win**.

Before you have a product that sells itself, you need stories that _speak_ for
it.

Whitney puts it best:

> “The first sale founders make with these stories is with themselves. Then
> they use them to hire, raise money, and attract beta users. Scale happens
> when these stories are passed on to your salespeople.”

If you're starting from zero, these three frameworks will get you your first
few wins. And those first few wins? They’re what unlock everything else.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Startup pricing strategies evolve as companies grow through three main stages
-

**Pre-PMF companies** prioritise rapid adoption and feedback, with founders
typically owning simple pricing models that optimise for usage over revenue.

**Early PMF** firms shift focus to repeatability and revenue, introducing more
complex pricing owned by product teams or early GTM hires, often using preset
tiers or bundles.

**At scale,** companies maximise value capture with dedicated pricing teams
and deal desks, introducing sophisticated elements like varied commitment
structures and multiple pricing models.

They're more willing to walk away from suboptimal deals and may eliminate
legacy discounts. Square's journey from simple flat pricing to a more nuanced
approach as it grew illustrates this evolution, showing how pricing strategy
can align with and support a company's overall brand promise and market
position.

However, at every stage, one of the **hardest parts of managing pricing is
knowing whether or not your strategy** is having its desired effect.

The reason for this is simple – for the deals you’ve won, it’s nearly
impossible to know how much money you might have left on the table based on
the customer’s ultimate willingness to pay, and for deals you’ve lost, it’s
possible your product’s functionality, or any number of other complications,
might have been the primary culprit.

For self-serve pricing, it’s difficult to measure which prospects may have
dropped out of the funnel due to pricing vs. which felt they were getting the
bargain of the century. The list of complexities goes on.

At the earliest stages, your analysis is going to be less sophisticated and
will likely centre around listening to customer feedback.

As your company matures, you’ll have enough data points to analyse wins and
losses, customer cohorts, revenue by segment, and other relevant trends.

Here are a few strategies you can employ to get a sense of whether pricing at
your company is working as intended:

  1. **Competitive reviews and customer surveys**

Continue benchmarking your pricing against top competitors. Just as important,
talk to customers directly. Ask how they perceive the value you deliver vs.
what you charge. Don’t rely only on NPS or support feedback. Create a pricing-
specific check-in loop, select a few customers from each segment, and review
their price view regularly. You’ll spot gaps early.

  2. **Routine price increases**

Test controlled price increases with small customer cohorts. Watch for churn,
drop in conversion, or resistance. If nothing changes, your customers can
likely pay more. One way VCs assess this: ask if customers would still buy the
product if the price doubled.

If you’re able to raise prices without friction, you haven’t hit the upper
limit of willingness to pay.

  3. **Variance analysis**

Map every customer’s average sale price (ASP) and segment by attributes like
region, company size, or industry. If pricing looks random, it’s likely deal-
by-deal and inconsistent. That’s a problem. Look for patterns and identify
high and low outliers. Decide whether to normalise them or adjust your
packaging. Consistency here supports scalable growth.

  4. **Price realisation**

Plot your discounting behaviour. Express deal prices as a percentage discount
to the rack rate. What’s your median? If it’s consistently over 50%, your list
price is too high, or your sales team is too loose on approvals.

High discounting eats margins, slows deals, and creates internal friction.
Tighten pricing discipline as you scale.

  5. **Sales efficiency and escalation tracking**

Track how long deals take, how often they escalate for approvals, and how many
pricing negotiations are involved.

If deals are too slow, your pricing may be too high or misaligned.

If they’re closing instantly with no questions, you might be underpriced.
Cross-check this with burn multiple and sales efficiency metrics over time.

Processes like those outlined above may be owned by any number of stakeholders
(again, this number is largely dependent upon the company stage).

How often you formally revisit pricing is company-specific; for those later-
stage companies with dedicated pricing teams, it’s deliberated daily. For pre-
PMF companies in heads-down building mode, it’s likely done on an ad hoc
basis.

I’ve seen posts claiming that VCs will ask you 250+ questions in a pitch
meeting. That’s nonsense. No investor is sitting there running through a
checklist that long. (If you know one, let me know—I’d love to meet them.)

Instead, here’s a list of key questions you’re likely to face. These are the
ones I used to ask while working with VC firms, and I’ve also gathered
insights from leading investors to curate this list.:

  * Tell me a bit about your background and your co-founder(s)’s background.

  * How do you all know each other?

  * Why is your team uniquely motivated to solve this problem?

  * Why did you pick your co-founder?

  * Who do you need to hire during the next 18 months to be successful?

  * When was the last time you had disagreed on a business issue? How did you resolve it?

  * Do the founders have the knowledge to build the technology or would they need outside help?

  * What does the cap table look like? (equity distribution across founders)

  * How are people solving this problem today?

  * Describe your solution to this problem.

  * What effort/timing is required to switch from a different solution to yours?

  * (For deeptech) What is unique about the tech? (Do you have any patents / IP / trademarks?)

  * What is your product roadmap for the next 6-12 months?

  * Why now?

  * How big is this specific market?

  * What is your unfair advantage?

  * Who would you see as your key competitor at the moment? Why?

  * Who is your customer persona?

  * How much are people paying today? (range?)

  * How are you currently getting users / customers? (what customer acq channel(s)?)

  * How do you think you will get users / customers in the future?

  * How much does it cost you currently to get a user? And in which channel?

  * How much does your solution/product cost (COGs)?

  * Why do people buy / use your solution?

  * What is the sales cycle to-date?

  * How does the product team interact with current and potential customers? If so, how and how often?

  * What differentiates your solution from other alternatives?

  * Who are you more afraid of: Google or another startup?

  * What happens if a Google (or equiv) does this?

  * Who are the major players?

  * What is your moat?

  * When did you start the company?

  * How many customers do you have to date?

  * How much revenue have you generated to date?

  * Any notable customers?

  * What does retention or churn look like? (if you know)

  * What does engagement look like?

  * Any upsells?

  * When will your company break even in terms of profitability and cash flow?

  * How much have you raised to date?

  * How much are you looking to raise?

  * Where are you in your round?

  * What is your burn rate?

  * What is your top priority for the next 3-6 months?

  * What are your capital costs? (if capital intensive, like hardware/e-commerce)

  * Have you secured a lead investor for the round? If so, who and how much is the lead investing?

That’s it. You don’t need to prepare for 250+ questions. Some questions might
even feel frustrating, like “What if Google builds this?” or “How does this
become a billion-dollar company?” I know many founders get stuck on these and
struggle to answer them.

With the help of leading investors and founders, we’ve **prepared a detailed
guide that shares important questions investors** will ask and how to answer
them. You can check [it out here.](https://theventurecrew.gumroad.com/l/vc-
questions-kit)

Most startup advice tells you to focus on customers and ignore competitors.
That used to work.

But the landscape has changed. Competition shows up fast, often well-funded
and with overlapping features. Ignoring them doesn’t help you stay ahead.

I came across [this post](https://producthabits.com/stop-ignoring-
competitors/) from Marie Prokopets, co-founder of FYI and Product Habits, on
competitors and found it interesting that every founder should consider the
following. So sharing a few key points and thoughts on this:

  1. **Competitor research = customer research**

Studying your competitors isn’t about copying them. It’s about understanding
how customer expectations are shifting. The products people use, the features
they talk about, the pain points they still complain about all of this is
visible in competitor reviews, product pages, and switching behaviour.

  2. **You’re likely underestimating the competition**

28% of companies do no formal competitor research. Many others treat it as
occasional Googling. But real insight comes from structured research — looking
at review sites, doing surveys, and even tracking what customers say when they
switch tools.

  3. **There are four kinds of competitors you should be tracking**

  * **Direct competitors** : Solving the same problem for the same customer.

  * **Indirect competitors** : Similar customers, different solution.

  * **Alternative solutions** : Spreadsheets, pen and paper, consultants, anything customers use to solve the same job manually.

  * **Multiple tool solutions** : Tools customers stitch together (like Zapier + Airtable) to get the job done.

Ignoring any of these means you’re missing a part of the picture.

  4. **Four practical ways to do competitive research**

  * **Customer interviews and surveys** : Learn why people switch products, what they love or hate, and which features matter most.

  * **Competitor websites** : Homepages, pricing pages, and testimonials reveal customer segments, value props, and shifting narratives.

  * **Review sites** : G2, Capterra, TrustRadius. These tell you exactly what users think, in their own words.

  * **Switch interviews** : Find people who recently switched tools. Map out their journey. Look for patterns. This is how you uncover the emotional triggers behind decisions.

  5. **You can even build an MVP to test what your competitors got wrong**

At FYI, Marie built a 5-day MVP just to validate whether “search across docs”
(the most common solution among competitors) worked. Turns out, it didn’t
drive daily use. That single MVP saved them years of product mistakes.

  6. **Competitor data isn’t just for benchmarking — it reveals opportunity**

You’ll learn where customers are still unsatisfied. You’ll spot shifts in
sentiment. You’ll catch trends earlier. And over time, you’ll understand the
market better than those who ignore it.

Competitor research isn’t about being reactive. It’s about being informed. And
if you do it right, you’ll know more about your customers than your
competitors ever will.
