##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

I've shared a few articles on how to convince investors that your market is
big enough (You can check out the [archive
page](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/archive)). However, I've recently
noticed a troubling trend in startup decks. While many teams have strong
experience and are solving significant problems, founders often stumble when
asked about market size. Some even struggle to explain their approach to
calculating it. This lack of clarity is a major red flag for any startup.

Let me share a great example of market research done right—right at the
inception of a business. Facebook (now Meta) is almost ubiquitous in modern
life. However, it wasn’t always like that. When Facebook was new, the entire
social media sphere was effectively untested and unproven. Facebook (then
TheFacebook) needed to prove a lot—not least that there was an actual audience
for it. Here’s an actual slide from those early days:

It makes a pretty compelling argument, right? Without Facebook having such a
successful proposition early in its life, it may have never had the
opportunity to grow into what it is today, but investors bought into the
promise of tapping into the college students market, and the rest is history.

So, how did Facebook arrive at those numbers, and how can you do the same for
your startup? This write-up is all about market size. I promise that after
reading this article, you’ll never have doubts about calculating market size.
Let’s dive in!

**TAM** = Total Addressable Market (Or Total Available Market)

This represents the revenue opportunity that a company has if it has a full
100% of the market share, and there is no competition.

**SAM** = Serviceable Addressable Market

This represents the “slice” of the TAM “pie” that can be served by a company’s
products and services.

**SOM** = Serviceable Obtainable Market

This represents the actual amount of the market that is being served by the
company’s products and services.

These three terms are related to one another, and are generally depicted as a
series of three circles -

Of the three, TAM is the foundation, so we’ll start by calculating that first.

TAM is the “pie in the sky” number. It represents the absolute maximum
possible revenue that a business could generate in the market, if every single
potential customer is converted into a paying customer, and each of those
customers is providing the full maximum revenue.

It’s a useful number as it helps to understand the potential scale of the
business, and can help to establish a seed of the go-to-market strategy.
However, it’s not a realistic goal. No matter how well you execute the
business strategy, you’ll never reach the TAM number, because it assumes that
you’re the only provider of the product or service and have zero competition.

When calculating TAM, there are a few different approaches you can take. These
include:

**Top Down Approach**

The top-down approach starts with a broad market size and narrows it down to
your specific market segment. This method typically relies on industry reports
and market research studies.

  * **Step 1** : Identify the total market size using industry data from reputable sources such as Gartner, Forrester, or industry-specific reports.

  * **Step 2** : Segment this data to reflect your specific market. For example, if you are targeting small businesses with your software, you would narrow the data to show the number of small businesses in your market.

  * **Step 3** : Apply relevant percentages to reflect the portion of the market you can realistically target.

Example: If the overall software market is $100 billion and small businesses
represent 20% of this market, your TAM would be $20 billion.

**Bottom-Up Approach**

Alternatively, you can make TAM calculations based on previous sales and
pricing.

  * ake the total number of potential customers in a market, and multiply that number by the annual contract value (ACV).

  * The ACV is the amount of revenue that you would gain from each customer contract, on average.

This is a simple equation. Say you sell medical software, at an average of
$1,000 for a year’s license. The only customers that are going to be
interested in this software are hospitals, of which there are 1,352 hospitals
in the particular country. Your TAM, therefore, is $1.35 million.

**Value Theory Approach**

The third method of determining TAM is a little more subjective but
particularly useful for entrepreneurs in highly innovative sectors, or those
that aren’t yet selling a product. The value theory approach is based on how
much customers are willing to pay for your product or service in exchange for
the value that they’re getting for it.

The calculation is the same as the bottom-up approach, above, but rather than
calculating the average sale price, you’re looking at what a comparable
product sells for, and what premium your superior product could attract.

To use the medical software example above, say that your software is the first
in the space that sits in the cloud and allows hospital administrators to
access the software from anywhere. In this instance, you would want to include
the premium that administrators would pay for that convenience to the TAM, to
represent the greater expected revenue you would get from each customer for
your unique feature.

With the SAM, we start getting a little more realistic about things. SAM is a
calculation that understands that no product can service an entire market.

Calculating SAM is a continuation of the bottom-up approach that you used to
calculate TAM. This is the point where you start to get more realistic about
just how much of your product you can sell.

Every startup entrepreneur fantasizes that their product will be relevant to
everyone in their category, but that of course is not the case.

To continue our example above, perhaps your product has a set of features that
make it more relevant to the public hospital sector than the private hospital
sector. A percentage of the private hospitals in the particular country might
still purchase the solution (more if your sales team is good!), but the SAM
calculation would therefore be based on the number of public hospitals in that
country. There are 695 of them, meaning that with an ACV (Annual Contract
Value) of $1,000, the SAM for your software package is $695,000.

Finally, we come to SOM. This represents the _actual_ amount of the market
that is being served by your company’s products and services, and while it’s
only relevant once you’re in the market, it becomes a critical component in
assessing your startup and its potential going forward.

You’ll want to start calculating SOM once your business is in the market and
has customers.

The SOM is determined by calculating last year’s market share, multiplied by
this year’s SAM value.

First, you need to determine market share. Say there are only two businesses
that sell software with this functionality, and your business sold $400,000 in
software last year. Your market share is that number, divided by the SAM
(around 0.58, or 58%). Your rival has the remaining 42%.

Now, say there were an additional 20 hospitals brought online in the year. The
new SAM for the next year is $715,000. Your SOM is determined by multiplying
the market share from last year with the SAM for this year—or roughly $414,700
in this example.

If you end up earning more for the year than that number, then you’re taking
market share from your rival. If you earn less, then you’ll want to explore
why your competitor is gaining traction.

Note:

While SOM measures market share, and therefore is 0 until your business is in
the market, there are, of course, ways to estimate the market share that your
product will target once in the market. For illustrative purposes—for example,
when pitching to VCs—creating hypothetical SOM scenarios in this way might be
a useful exercise for a founder.

  * Investor attraction: TAM especially tells a story that can attract investors. They prefer a "Goldilocks" TAM - not too high (suggests saturation) or too low (limited growth potential).

  * Growth potential: A larger TAM allows startups to show how they can expand their market, either by adapting their product or entering new markets.

  * Market positioning: In saturated markets, the gap between TAM, SAM, and SOM indicates the difficulty and cost of acquiring customers, which affects investor interest.

  * Funding prospects: A small TAM may limit large funding rounds unless expansion potential can be demonstrated.

  * Strategy development: Understanding these metrics helps startups identify underserved segments within mature markets where they can quickly gain market share.

First, opt for a bottom-up approach over a top-down. This shows you've done
original research and analysis, rather than just grabbing numbers off Google.

It demonstrates how you see your startup fitting into the market. Second,
don't inflate your numbers. Stick to your core audience - if you're targeting
Gen Z in a particular country, don't include millennials or global figures.
Third, be clear about geography. Unless you're aiming for global operations
from the start, make sure your TAM data reflects your specific target market.

Fourth, be prepared for scrutiny on pricing. If you're pre-revenue, your TAM
will involve assumptions about the average selling price. Make sure these are
defensible and have the math ready when investors ask. Finally, show a vision
for future growth. Highlight how your product roadmap could expand your TAM
over time. Think about how Facebook started with college students but now
includes boomers and Gen-X. A well-crafted TAM slide can set you up for
success with investors, so it's worth putting in the effort to get it right.

That’s it.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

What makes or breaks a startup? Is it the idea, team, funding, business model,
or just plain luck? You’re probably thinking, "If I have all of these locked
in, I’m golden!" But there’s one factor that founders often underestimate:
timing.

In fact, **bad timing is one of the top reasons 90% of startups fail.** You
can have the best team and an amazing product, but if the market isn’t ready
for you (or has already moved on), it’s game over.

So how do you figure out if the timing is right? It starts with understanding
the kind of market you’re entering. **Here are the four market scenarios every
founder should know:**

1\. **Small Market, Not Growing**

If the market is tiny and shows no signs of growth, stop right there. Think
selling fax machines or landline phones today—there’s no story to tell here.
Venture capitalists won’t bite, and you’ll struggle to scale.

2\. **Large Market, Growth in the Past**

The smartphone market is a good example. Imagine launching a new smartphone
brand today—you’d be up against giants like Apple and Samsung with their
massive resources. Even with the best product, you’ll bleed money trying to
compete.

But there’s a silver lining. Some “crowded” markets can still have
opportunities for new ideas. Pinterest, Instagram, and Snapchat all launched
when social networks seemed dominated by Facebook and Twitter. They found
niches by enabling new use cases: pinning, filtered photos, and disappearing
messages.

3\. **Small Market, Too Early**

Being early is as bad as being wrong. Many great ideas have failed simply
because the market wasn’t ready. Remember WebVan (online groceries in the
'90s)? Or WebTV (Internet-connected TVs before broadband was a thing)? Both
burned through millions and failed.

How to avoid this? Use Sam Altman’s test: _Do enthusiasts use this tech all
day, every day?_ If they don’t, it’s likely a fake trend.

4\. **Small Market, Growing Quickly**

This is the sweet spot. Small, fast-growing markets are where magic happens.
Large companies often ignore these opportunities because they’re too small to
justify a big investment. But for startups, this is your playground.

Examples? The rise of smartphones, cloud computing, and remote work created
billion-dollar opportunities for companies like WhatsApp, AWS, and Zoom. These
shifts were driven by new technology, changing behaviour, or both.

Want to find these opportunities? Stay curious, try new tools, and position
yourself to move fast when the timing is right.

So overall -

  * **Small, stagnant markets?** Don’t bother.

  * **Large, saturated markets?** You’re fighting giants with a slingshot.

  * **Early markets?** You’ll burn cash waiting for the world to catch up.

But if you find that **small, fast-growing market**? That’s your golden
ticket. It’s where startups thrive, incumbents snooze, and opportunities feel
endless.

The truth is, that startup success is as much about timing as it is about
execution. Show up too late, and the party’s over. Show up too early, and no
one’s there. But show up just in time? That’s where you win.

Sarah Tavel, General Partner at Benchmark, developed a way to understand user
engagement called the Hierarchy of Engagement.

**Level 1:** Develop a “core action” you want users to take. Most often the
core action is the action most correlated with retention. Facebook was growing
your friend list.

**Level 2:** Enable network effects. Make sure that more people = more value
on the network. Using our FB example, the more friends you have on FB the
harder it is to leave.

**Level 3:** Flywheels and more flywheels. Once you have engaged users, make
sure the time they’re engaged creates more engagement from other users —
create an infinite engagement glitch in the matrix. For FB, having more
friends on the platform meant you would invite more friends to join the
platform. ([Link](https://sarahtavel.medium.com/the-hierarchy-of-engagement-
expanded-648329d60804))

Network Effects – the magic sauce behind some of the biggest companies in the
world. Twitter, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Uber, and Tesla have all leveraged
network effects to build massive moats and dominate their markets.

But what are network effects? In simple terms: the more people use your
product, the more valuable it becomes. Think of WhatsApp: we use it because
everyone we know is already on it. The value of the platform grows with each
additional user.

Here’s a wild stat: A study by NFX found that _70% of the value created by
tech companies_ since 1994 comes from network effects. Crazy, right?

So, how can you tell if your startup has network effects? It’s not as simple
as a “yes” or “no.” Network effects fall along a spectrum, evolving with your
product, users, and competition. Here’s a quick breakdown of how to measure
it:

**Acquisition Metrics**

  * Organic vs. Paid Users: Is your proportion of organic users growing? Over time, network effects should reduce reliance on paid growth.

  * Source of Traffic: Are more users coming directly to your platform instead of via ads or third-party sites? (Think OpenTable – early on, traffic came through restaurant widgets, but later, users went straight to OpenTable.)

**Competitor Metrics**

  * Multi-Tenanting: How many of your users also use competitor platforms? Reducing this is key to building loyalty.

  * Switching Costs: Is it easy for users to switch to other platforms? The harder you make it (e.g., by creating a sticky experience), the better your network effects.

**Engagement Metrics**

  * Retention Cohorts: Are newer users sticking around longer as the network grows?

  * Power Users: Are more users becoming highly active? A right-leaning power user curve means engagement is improving.

  * Location Trends: For local networks, older geographies should have higher retention as network density increases.

**Economics Metrics**

  * Pricing Power: Can you charge more over time without losing users? Strong network effects increase what users are willing to pay.

  * Unit Economics: Track market-by-market data (especially for local networks). Over time, CAC should drop, organic growth should rise, and profitability should improve.

The TL;DR? Network effects aren’t binary, but understanding the dynamics
behind them can help you unlock sustainable growth. Focus on the right metrics
to measure what’s working and where to improve.
