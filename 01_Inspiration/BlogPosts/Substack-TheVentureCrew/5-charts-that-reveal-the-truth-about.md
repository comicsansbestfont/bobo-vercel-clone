##### **START WITH**

Bank of America’s latest fund [manager survey
shows](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/5-charts-to-help-decipher-the-
great-ai-bubble-debate) something we haven’t seen since 2005: Most public-
market investors now believe corporations are overspending on CapEx, and AI is
the reason.

Here’s what’s driving the concern:

**Investors think AI CapEx is getting out of control**

  * Hyperscalers have tripled data-center CapEx since late 2023.

  * For the first time in 20 years, a majority of fund managers say companies should slow spending and repair balance sheets.

  * This fear is amplified by the fact that AI data centers depreciate quickly, meaning ROI must come fast — and that’s uncertain.

**AI infrastructure needs ~$5T — but there’s a $1.4T funding gap**

  * JPMorgan estimates the full AI buildout requires **$5 trillion** over the next decade.

  * Even with Big Tech + public markets + private equity + debt markets combined, there’s still a **$1.4T shortfall**.

  * This gap likely forces:

    * Private credit funds to step in

    *     * New financing structures (JVs, project finance, sovereign-backed GPU deals)

**Meta–Blue Owl’s $27B deal shows where things are headed**

  * Meta partnered with Blue Owl in a $27B joint venture to build AI data centers.

  * Blue Owl is funding a portion via PIMCO and bond investors, not equity.

  * This signals that AI infrastructure is outgrowing Big Tech’s internal cash flow — and now needs Wall Street scale financing.

**Public markets are cautious — private markets are euphoric**

Public investors are jittery. Private markets? Doing the opposite:

  * AI valuations have rebounded above 2020–2022 bubble levels.

  * Mega-rounds are normal again.

  * Every major VC is raising dedicated AI funds.

This disconnect is exactly what happened during the dot-com and ZIRP-era
peaks.

**If confidence cracks, private AI valuations could snap**

  * Every major AI boom in the past decade ended abruptly when public markets pulled back.

  * Sundar Pichai even acknowledged: “No company is going to be immune.”

  * If CapEx concerns accelerate, private AI deal prices could correct suddenly, especially for: LLM developers, AI infra startups, and Capital-intensive agentic companies

For now? VCs keep writing huge checks. Hyperscalers keep spending. Debt
markets keep underwriting massive AI data-center projects.

But the anxiety is rising — and the “is this a bubble?” question is no longer
fringe.

For decades, Stanford, Harvard, and Wharton MBAs were a near-guarantee to
break into venture. But PitchBook’s recent
[analysis](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/is-an-mba-still-worth-it-if-
you-want-to-make-it-in-v) shows that the advantage is fading fast.

  * **The numbers** : Around 50 Harvard MBAs and 30 Stanford MBAs joined VC firms last year, with a median starting salary of $177,500. Yet the share of new VCs with MBAs has dropped from 44% in the early 2000s to ~32% today.

  * **The shift** : Firms now prize “builders” from places like OpenAI, SpaceX, and Palantir over B-school résumés. These hires bring direct operating experience and strong founder networks.

  * **Still a signal** : Certain schools (Stanford, Harvard, Wharton, LBS, Columbia, Kellogg) show a statistical boost in investment performance, according to new research. Alumni networks also continue to drive deal flow.

  * **The tradeoff** : An MBA can still open doors, but it comes with a ~$200K opportunity cost. Meanwhile, AI is replacing many junior VC tasks, narrowing entry-level roles.

The MBA badge is no longer the default path into venture. It may help at
specific firms and networks, but increasingly, operating at a breakout startup
is the stronger credential.

##### **SOMETHING MORE**

Most founders try every growth tactic they see on the internet. The fastest-
growing SaaS companies don’t. They sequence their growth — using the right 3–5
levers at the right revenue stage. ICONIQ, Founderpath, and hundreds of SaaS
founders keep repeating the same thing: growth is not about working harder,
it’s about picking leverage that compounds.

Below is a cleaner, [practical breakdown ](https://founderpath.com/blog/how-
to-grow-startup-growth-hacks)you can follow no matter where you are shared by
Nathan Latka :

**Stage 1: Bootstrap to $1M Revenue — Speed and Cash First**

At this stage, anything slow is a distraction. You want distribution loops,
cheap awareness, and anything that directly converts attention into revenue.

**What works best**

  * **Virality loops**

  * **Webinars that sell** Run tight, niche sessions with a strong CTA. Founders who are good storytellers convert faster because webinars collapse trust cycles.

  * **Product Hunt launches.** One strong PH push = thousands of new users. Relaunch often, test different angles, collect emails.

  * **Cold outreach with personalisation,** Loom videos + targeted lists outperform templates. Even 100 great emails can get your first $10K–$20K MRR.

  * **Influencer marketing (micro-creators only)** Bottom-up trust works better than polished brand ads. Partner with niche creators who feel “native” to your audience.

**What founders should remember** At <$1M, your job is to find _one_
repeatable way to acquire users cheaply. Most founders stall because they
chase too many channels instead of doubling down on one.

**Stage 2: $1M–$3M ARR — Build Compounding Inbound + Partnerships**

This is where the engine needs more predictability. Founders who grow 300%+
yearly build content systems, partner loops, and scalable inbound.

**Plays that work consistently**

  * **Free tools** Calculators, templates, grading tools — these index extremely well and convert better than blog posts. Shopify scaled free tools into billions.

  * **Newsletter** Publishing weekly builds authority, lowers CAC, and compounds trust. At this stage, the founder voice is still the strongest asset.

  * **Co-marketing with partners** Joint webinars, shared ebooks, mutual case studies. This drives warm leads at almost zero cost.

  * **Affiliate programs** Think of it as a distributed sales team that only gets paid on performance. Stripe and Zapier used this extremely early.

  * **Compare pages and programmatic SEO** “X vs Y” pages rank fast for high-intent queries and consistently pull in users without spending.

**Founder reminder** Your time shifts from raw selling → building repeatable
acquisition flywheels.

**Stage 3: $3M–$5M ARR — Paid Growth + Acceleration**

Now you have a working engine. The question becomes: how do we scale what
already works while keeping CAC under control?

**High-impact tactics**

  * **Retargeting** Target people who already touched your product — demo viewers, free trials, website visitors.

  * **Lookalike ads** Feed Meta/Google a list of your top 500 users. This performs better than any cold targeting.

  * **LinkedIn + short-form video ads** Works well for B2B if messaging focuses on revenue triggers, not features.

  * **Acquisitions (small ones)** Buy small tools, Chrome extensions, or utilities that give you more distribution or features instantly.

**Founder reminder** Paid acquisition works when your retention is strong. If
churn is weak, nothing in this stage will scale.

**Stage 4: $5M+ ARR — Build Moats That Defend Your Category**

At this point, growth comes from trust, brand presence, and ecosystem
dominance. These plays are slow but incredibly durable.

**Moats that actually work**

  * **Review site dominance** G2, Capterra, and TrustRadius. Enterprise buyers care more about peer validation than ads.

  * **App marketplace distribution:** Salesforce, HubSpot, Zapier — marketplaces can become passive growth channels.

  * **Books + podcasts + events** These aren’t vanity — they’re how you cement a category narrative and attract higher-ticket buyers.

  * **Live events + communities** You build a tribe around your brand. Companies like Notion and Figma built defensibility with community long before they had revenue.

**Founder reminder** At scale, your advantage is no longer speed. It’s
authority, relationships, and the ecosystems you control.

You don’t need all 31 tactics. You need the right ones for your stage. The
best founders don’t hustle harder, they sequence smarter — and they resist the
temptation to mix Stage 1 tactics with Stage 4 tactics. That’s how companies
go from $0 to $10M without burning themselves out.

Henley Wing Chiu just
[analysed](https://bloomberry.com/blog/i-analyzed-1000-forward-deployed-
engineer-jobs-what-i-learned/) 1,000 forward-deployed engineer (FDE) job
postings, and the findings explain why every AI startup is suddenly hiring
them.

The role has exploded by 1,165% YoY, and yet most people still can’t define
what an FDE actually does. Henley’s breakdown clears up the confusion and
shows why this job has become critical in the era of AI agents.

Most companies aren’t hiring “sales engineers with a cooler title.” They’re
hiring a new kind of engineer: someone who embeds with customers, writes
production code, and gets complex AI systems working in messy real-world
environments.

Here’s the practical summary founders and operators should know:

**What a real FDE actually is** Forward-deployed engineers fall mostly into
one category:

  * A full-stack engineer who works directly with customers

  * Codes 70–90% of the time

  * Deploys LLMs, agents, integrations and backend systems

  * Travels and embeds inside customer teams until the solution works

If the job carries quota or demo targets, it’s not an FDE — it’s a sales
engineer rebranded.

**Why demand is exploding (1,165% YoY)** Startups learned the hard way that
selling AI isn’t enough. Deploying it into existing workflows is where
everything breaks. Companies need engineers who can:

  * Integrate LLMs into legacy systems

  * Build RAG pipelines that don’t hallucinate

  * Debug real failures in production

  * Translate customer requirements into actual shipped code

AI moved from “experiment” to “deployment,” and that shifted demand straight
into FDEs.

**The skill stack companies want**

  * Python (66%) and TypeScript (35%)

  * Cloud + container skills (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, Docker)

  * AI/LLM experience (Claude, GPT-4/5, RAG, agents)

  * Strong communication and customer-facing ability

The surprising part: soft skills appeared almost as often as technical skills
— companies want engineers who can speak to executives, handle ambiguity, and
guide customers through change.

**Who hires FDEs**

  * Mostly growth-stage startups (11–200 employees)

  * Heavy in financial services, healthcare, defense, insurance

  * Companies whose product wins only when it is successfully deployed

If your product requires deep integration or agent workflows, an FDE becomes a
force multiplier.

**Compensation and experience**

This is an engineering role — not a GTM one — and compensation reflects that.  
Forward-deployed engineering is rising because AI deployment is brittle,
complex, and customer-specific. Founders building AI products should think
about hiring their first FDE long before building a big services team. And for
engineers, this is the fastest-growing, highest-leverage job in tech if you
enjoy both shipping code and working with real customers.

Deciding whether to offer a freemium model is a common dilemma for founders.
Many try out freemium strategies, but not all SaaS companies can replicate the
success of Dropbox or Typeform.

Done wrong, freemium can end up cannibalising your paid user base while also
draining your company’s precious engineering and customer support resources.

So how can you determine if it’s the right move for your company?

The most reliable way to find out is through A/B testing. However, getting
solid results can take a long time, especially if you’re looking at the impact
on virality and your viral cycle is six months or longer.

If you can’t wait that long or aren’t set up for a full A/B test, consider
these “Three Factors for Freemium Strategy”:

  1. **Does your paid plan have a gross margin of 80–90%?**  
If you have a lower gross margin — for example, because your product is not
fully self-service, requires extensive customer support or is extremely costly
in terms of tech infrastructure — freemium will probably not work for you.

  2. **Does your free plan attract the right audience?**  
If your free users are too different from your paying users, your free-to-
paying conversion will be low, and you’ll risk developing your product for the
wrong audience.

  3. **Is your product inherently viral?**  
If your answer is no, that doesn’t make it a complete no-go, but it does mean
that it’s much less likely that freemium is right for you.

In the end, freemium only makes sense if a certain percentage of your free
users do one of three things:

  * Eventually, convert to paid,

  * Refer paying customers, or

  * Provide the kind of valuable feedback that will improve your product.

A freemium product that fails to achieve any of these effects will merely
saddle you with extra costs and distract you from servicing your most
important users.

Also, check out this interesting article on [why companies fail with
freemium](https://medium.com/swlh/why-do-companies-fail-with-
freemium-600e6b607127). I highly recommend it, definitely worth a read.

Most founders talk about growth. Few can clearly show how each new customer
makes or loses them money. That’s why running a unit economics model early
matters; it tells you if your business will compound or collapse.

Here’s how to use the sheet I’ve shared:

1\. Map your revenues

  * Enter your average revenue per unit (subscription, fee, or transaction).

  * Decide if it’s recurring (monthly/annual) or one-time.

  * Pro tip: if you don’t know exact numbers yet, start with estimates and refine over time.

2\. Add cost of sales (COGS)

  * Enter costs as a % of revenue (hosting, delivery, support).

  * The sheet calculates your gross margin per unit automatically.

3\. Plug in churn + growth assumptions

  * Set billing cycle (monthly = 1, annual = 12).

  * Add churn % (customers who drop each cycle).

  * Add expected annual margin growth (e.g., 5%).

  * The model uses these to estimate the average customer lifetime.

4\. Add acquisition + retention costs

5\. Review key outputs

  * LTV (Lifetime Value): how much a customer is worth over their lifecycle.

  * LTV/CAC ratio: >3 is usually healthy.

  * CAC payback period: months it takes to earn back the acquisition spend.

  * Cumulative cash flows: show when you turn profitable per customer.

6\. Stress-test scenarios

Why this matters

  * Investors use this as a quick sanity check.

  * It forces you to confront pricing, churn, and acquisition head-on.

  * A business with shaky unit economics will break no matter how good the growth story sounds.

plug in your numbers, and run 3 scenarios: best case, expected case, worst
case. You’ll instantly see whether your idea scales or needs fixing.
