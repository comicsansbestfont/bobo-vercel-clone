Let’s deep into the fund modelling

Suppose, the fund, The Venture Crew has a fund size of $100 M and targeting to
invest in around 20 companies.

So, you might think the average check size = $100M / 20 = $5 M: Average check
size would be $5M and you might be thinking that it’s easy, but the
calculation and approach are wrong. Because here we haven’t considered the
Operating expenses or the fees charged by the VC fund. So, let’s consider all
the costs for the VC fund and deduce it from the fund size.

Generally, the management fees which are taken by most of the funds are around
2% of the fund size annually and considered the fund period of 10 years.

So, management fees = 2% * $100 M = $2M / year. This will be charged by vc
fund to manage their expenses. So, as the fund period is for 10 years, the
fees for the 10 years will be = $20 M for 10 years. So, let’s deduce the fees
from the fund size and look into the average cheque size:

Therefore, the average check size = ($100M - $20M) / 20Comapnies = $4 M. Now
the average check size to invest in a company is around $4M. Isn’t it easy,
but this approach is also wrong as we didn’t consider the follow-on and
investment amount that decide by the VC fund.

If you are not aware of what’s the **initial investment amount and follow-on
investment** in a VC fund? Let me explain these in simple words:

Every VC fund has its own fund period, in which it will utilize all funds to
invest in startups and also come up with some return for their investors. As
the Venture Crew fund has a fund period of 10 years, they will divide the fund
into the two-part - first: the initial investment amount which will invest in
the 20 startups in 4-5 years of period and seconds: follow investment which
will be invested in the same startup they had invested based on the past
performance as it will help to increase the stake in successful companies. So,
every fund decides the investment amount and the follow on investment amount
depends on the total fund size and agreement with the limited partners.

Let’s assume, the fund The Venture Crew decided to invest 50% of the fund size
in the follow-on.

So, the amount reserved for the follow-on investment = 50% * 100 M = $50M. And
Remaining net amount = $100M - $50M(follow-on investment) - $20M (fees for 10
years) = $30M;

$30M will be invested in the companies as the initial investment amount in 20
companies within a span of 4-5 years.

So, the average check size = $30M / 20 = $1.5M (This is the accurate
calculation for VC Opened Fund’s average check size).

Also, different investors can think about the follow-on investment amount in
various strategic way, as the follow-on investment amount help the venture
capital to filter out the losers and invest only in winners. The other way to
think about the follow-on investment amount - VC want to invest $2 for each $1
initial investment. Then the average check size is less than $1.5M. How? -

As VC want to invest $2 in follow-on investment for each $1 investment in the
Initial investment. As 2:1 => (20 *1.5*2) = $60M but we have $50M.

Hence average cheque size = $50M / (20 *2) = $1.25M.

That’s it. Hope this helps you to understand - how venture capital comes up
with the average check size. Let me summarize this -

Fund size ($100M) (A) → Subtract all management fees for the 10-year fund
period (B) → Divide the new fund amount into the initial investment amount and
follow on the investment amount which depends on the fund to fund → Subtract
the follow-on investment amount from the (B) fund amount (C) → Divide the C
fund size to the number of companies you want to invest.
