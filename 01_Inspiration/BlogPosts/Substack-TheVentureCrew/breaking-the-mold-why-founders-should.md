When it comes to sharing your fund-raising deck with venture capitalists
(VCs), the common advice is to send it as a link and track every detail. But
what if I told you there's a compelling counterargument? During my recent
conversations with multiple VCs, I stumbled upon a surprising and thought-
provoking perspective.

**Buckle up because I'm about to make the case for why you should just send
the deck itself.**

**Your pitch deck is more than just a document** – it's your most powerful
marketing tool. You don't need to hide your deepest secrets and plans in it;
instead, focus on showcasing your company in the best light possible. Imagine
a world where your deck is so impressive that it gets forwarded to the entire
VC team or sparks requests to share it with other portfolio companies. You
want your deck to be so compelling that VCs can't help but keep coming back to
it, eager to learn more about your company.

**But here's the catch:** VCs are fully aware of the tracking capabilities
embedded in links. By using links, you may unintentionally limit the
consumption of your deck. So why add unnecessary "purchase friction" to the
reader's experience? You want them to engage with your deck multiple times as
they consider investing in your company. Tracking when they open it won't
provide any meaningful insights into their thoughts and interests.

Some **argue that online viewers** are more efficient because they eliminate
the need to download large files. However, the goal should be to create a
visually appealing deck that is under 10MB. You can optimize graphics and
resize files without compromising quality. Remember, you're not presenting at
TED – keep it concise, captivating, and focused.

Now, **let's talk about what should be in your deck.** Start with highlighting
your team, the problem you're solving, and your unique approach. Showcase the
value your product or service brings to customers, and explain any technology
differentiators or intellectual property you possess. Provide market size
data, discuss your competition and present unit economics. It's also crucial
to include financial projections and customer metrics, all while weaving these
elements into a captivating narrative.

On the flip side, **certain information should be excluded from your deck.**
Detailed feature roadmaps, specific customer details, and salary information
are best saved for later stages of the VC process. Keep in mind that your deck
shouldn't contain any information you wouldn't want your competitors or a
wider audience to see.

But here's a valuable insight: VCs love to measure your progress and strategy
over time. By sending your deck as a file, they can download it and refer back
to it during subsequent meetings. They want to see the evolution of your
narrative, strategy, and numbers. Even if your past projections were overly
optimistic, that's not a deal-breaker. It's the progress and growth trajectory
that matter.

Moreover, human memory being what it is, VCs may stumble upon a market or idea
and suddenly remember a company they encountered months ago – yours. They
would likely open your deck again, reigniting their interest. However, if your
deck is trapped in an email with an expired link, you might miss out on this
opportunity to stay on top of your mind.

In summary, your pitch deck is a sales and marketing masterpiece. Just like in
any sales activity, assume that your competition will eventually get their
hands on your deck – and that's okay! Remember, your success isn't determined
by your marketing deck alone; it's driven by your innovation and execution. So
go ahead, send the deck, and enjoy the numerous benefits it brings while
keeping the downsides to a minimum.

I hope this write-up gives you a different perspective. Just remember small
changes can lead to big differences.
