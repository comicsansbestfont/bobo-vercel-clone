##### **FROM OUR PARTNER - BOARDY**

I’d been trying to meet D2C founders for partnerships, but cold outreach was
going nowhere.

Then I messaged [Boardy](https://www.boardy.ai/) on WhatsApp. Within minutes,
its AI called me, asked about my startup, and who I wanted to meet. That same
day, I had a double opt-in intro to a perfect-fit founder, someone already
open and excited to connect.

**Founders use it to meet investors, land customers, hire talent, or get
expert advice**.

Every intro is vetted, so your time isn’t wasted, and the whole process feels
personal, quick, and effortless. One clear ask, one valuable connection.

**[Boardy’s](https://www.boardy.ai/) already helped founders close millions in
funding** and deals through intros like this.

##### **📜 DEEP DIVE**

Running a startup can feel like captaining a boat through a storm. You’re
blindfolded. The compass is broken. And you’re mostly guessing.

That’s where a financial forecast model comes in. First thing - it won’t tell
you the future. But it will help you see what’s coming, make smarter
decisions, and stretch your cash in the right direction.

If “building a financial model” sounds complex, overwhelming, or like
something you’ll “do later”... good news: it doesn’t have to be. We’ve created
a straightforward forecast model template you can copy, customise, and
actually use.

Let’s walk through why every founder (yes, even early-stage) should have one
and what to focus on.

  1. **Cash is oxygen**

Forget “cash is king.” For startups, cash is air.

Without it, you’re done. A forecast model helps you project income and
expenses across time, so you’re not surprised when the runway gets tight.
Instead of reacting when you're gasping, you’re making moves ahead of time.

  2. **Speak the language of money**

Investors. Board members. Loan officers. Even vendors.

They all want to see that you’ve got a handle on your finances. A forecast
model helps you show, not just say, that you’re building with a plan. It
proves you’re not winging it, even if it feels like that some days.

  3. **Get better at saying no**

Startups are full of decisions that sound exciting: “Let’s ramp up ads!” or
“Let’s hire three more engineers!”

But can you afford to do that and still build the product? A forecast model
helps you understand tradeoffs, prioritise resources, and stay focused on the
metrics that matter.

  4. **Know what really moves the needle**

Whether your goal is acquisition, profitability, or that next funding round
your forecast helps you zoom out and see what truly impacts your outcomes.

For example, improving retention by just 5% might move revenue way more than
launching that new feature you’re debating.

Let’s break it down into five core sections you should focus on, especially in
the early stages:

  1. **Customer acquisition**

Think about how you attract new customers. Break it into clear channels like:

  * Performance marketing: Ads, paid campaigns, etc. (Track CAC!)

  * Sales team productivity: Deals won per rep.

  * Organic growth: SEO, word of mouth, referrals.

Start simple, don’t overcomplicate with 10 variables per channel. Use broad
assumptions, then refine with real data over time.

  2. **Customer retention**

Acquiring a customer means nothing if you can’t keep them. Your model should
reflect how long customers stay, and when they tend to churn.

Use cohort analysis or a basic monthly churn rate. Ask:

Retention is also your best indicator of product-market fit.

  3. **Revenue**

Revenue should be tied directly to customer activity:

  * For SaaS, it’s subscription price × active customers.

  * For marketplaces, it could be volume × take rate.

Start with average revenue per user (ARPU), and evolve into more granular
views as you scale.

  4. **Expenses**

Your biggest expense? People. Use a headcount plan to map out salaries, hiring
timelines, and team functions. Other key categories include:

  * COGS: Hosting, inventory, services delivered.

  * Marketing spend: Performance + brand.

  * Tools & software: Scale with team size and complexity.

  * Office, travel, services: Keep it lean unless proven otherwise.

Don’t default to “% of revenue” unless you have no better data. You control
your budget, make it intentional.

  5. **Cash flow + runway**

At the end of the day, it’s about how long your cash lasts. Forecasting your
runway (how many months you can operate before running out of money) helps
guide:

  * Fundraising timelines

  * Hiring plans

  * Growth investments

Always stress-test with multiple scenarios:

  * Best-case (aggressive growth)

  * Base-case (reasonable assumptions)

  * Worst-case (conservative path)

**Tips to get started (without burning out)**

  * Start simple. This isn’t a Wall Street IPO model. It’s your startup’s guiding tool.

  * Update monthly. Compare forecast vs. actuals. Adjust your assumptions.

  * Don’t aim for perfection. Aim for utility. It’s better to have a rough, usable model than a flawless one that sits unopened.

  * Think of it as a living document. Not a one-time exercise.

**Remember your forecast model = your strategy, in numbers**

You don’t build a model because investors ask. You build it to understand your
own business better. To make smarter decisions. To align your team. To spot
problems early and act on them.

“The real magic happens when you strike a balance between planning and doing.”

##### **📄 QUICK WIN**

Mercury just published a detailed survey of 1,500 early-stage U.S. founders
(companies under 6 years old), and the results paint a surprisingly optimistic
picture of startups in 2025.

Despite rising costs and policy headwinds, founders are charging forward with
new playbooks, especially around AI, funding diversification, and hiring.

Here’s what every founder should know:

87% of founders say their confidence in their business’s financial prospects
has improved since 2024. That number jumps to 93% among companies that have
significantly adopted AI. First-time founders are also more optimistic (88%)
than repeat founders (76%).

The “VC or bust” mindset is fading. Tech companies still top the list for
venture money, but professional services lean heavily on self-funding (72%),
and retail is leading on revenue-based financing (49%).

Most rounds remain small, 73% raised under $5M, but larger, multi-source
strategies correlate with bigger raises.

Big fundraising doesn’t always equal high revenue. Many lean companies are
finding alternative paths to profitability, with a sweet spot at $5–10M
revenue, where most raise $1–5M. Half of $10M+ revenue companies still operate
with fewer than 100 employees.

66% of founders said expenses were higher than expected, especially in ops and
marketing.

Still, 79% plan to spend more this year — driven by growth opportunities
rather than investor pressure.

73% are increasing AI spend, and 55% are actively shifting budget from
“traditional” tools to AI. AI adopters are 3x more likely to be scaling teams,
2x more likely to seek bigger rounds, and ~4x more reliant on contractors
(especially for sales and marketing).

61% of companies hired in the past year. Among AI adopters, 79% said AI made
them hire more, not less.

Growth roles like sales, biz dev, marketing, and customer service are top
priorities.

61% of companies rely on freelancers/consultants, mostly for flexibility and
specialised skills. AI-forward companies in particular are turning contractors
into a growth lever, not just a stopgap.

73% said the R&D amortisation rule (since 2022) hurt finances, forcing many to
cut R&D budgets, delay projects, or slow hiring. Relief is on the way via the
July 2025 tax bill.

Early-stage founders are rewriting startup economics in real time. The old
formula of “raise VC, hire fast, scale linearly” is giving way to more
flexible models — diversified funding, leaner ops, contractors, and AI at the
core of strategy. Those embracing AI aren’t just cutting costs; they’re using
it to grow faster, raise bigger, and build more resilient companies.

up](https://mercury.com/blog/startup-economics-report-2025))

Jason Lemkin just [unpacked](https://www.saastr.com/winner-take-all-has-taken-
over-venture-the-top-1-of-ai-start-ups-are-now-valued-at-3-10x-normal-
multiples) fresh Carta data from 3,001 U.S. startup rounds (Sept 2024–Aug
2025), and the numbers are staggering: the top 1% of AI startups are now
valued at 3–10x higher multiples than “normal” SaaS companies.

This isn’t just a hot market. It’s a structural split.

  * In one universe, solid SaaS and B2B startups raise at familiar, disciplined multiples.

  * In the other, AI-native companies are trading in a different universe altogether.

At seed, the 99th percentile valuations are hitting $161M (+123% above the
95th percentile). By Series A, “legendary” AI companies are valued at $716M
vs. $250M at the 95th. Series B? A shocking $2B median at the top 1%. And by
Series C/D, it’s $7–8B valuations for companies still technically in “growth”
stages.

**Why is this happening? Three forces:**

  1. **AI-native moats compound:** every customer interaction improves the model, making competition almost impossible.

  2. **Infinite TAM + efficiency:** SaaS might 3x a market by expanding internationally; AI startups are 10x-ing TAM by automating entire job functions while improving margins.

  3. **“Never raise again” premium:** the best AI-native companies could realistically stop raising forever, generating cash with widening moats. VCs will pay infinite multiples for that.

The market now looks like a three-tier structure:

  * Tier 1: Traditional SaaS (predictable, disciplined multiples, but limited upside).

  * Tier 2: AI-enhanced SaaS (gets some premium, but still feature parity vs. AI-native).

  * Tier 3: AI-native category creators (valuations in a different universe; true winner-take-all).

The lesson for founders is stark: building a “good SaaS company” may no longer
be enough. The middle ground is disappearing. Either you’re proving AI is core
to your business, or you’re competing for scraps.

For investors, the cost of being wrong is higher than ever; confusing an AI-
enhanced SaaS for a true AI-native category creator could mean missing
generational returns.

As Lemkin puts it, in venture today, there’s the AI game and everything else.
