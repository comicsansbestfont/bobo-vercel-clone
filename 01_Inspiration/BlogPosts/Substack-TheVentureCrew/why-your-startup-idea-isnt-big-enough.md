VC functions with a power law, the majority of a fund’s returns come from a
small percentage of investments.

Because of this, Venture Capital need to know if a single investment can
return the entire fund. What does it mean? Let’s understand this 👇

 _Fig: Power Law In Venture Capital_

As [Bill Gurley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gurley) said “Venture
capital is not even a home-run business. It’s a grand slam business.” This is
where the Return The Fund (RTF) analysis comes into play.

Look at the below Data from 2004-2013.

_https://www.sethlevine.com/archives/2014/08/venture-outcomes-are-even-more-
skewed-than-you-think.html_

If we assume an exit distribution, over 60% of a fund’s investments are 0–2x
their money, With the remainder falling between 2–5x, a “unicorn” type 10x+
outcome can put a venture fund into the desired 3x fund returns that put them
among the top performers in VC.

Your 1–3 investments that “return the fund” and probably even more (the grand
slam), are what will make or break you, While the other 2x-5x investments
create additional alpha.

**Let's understand the math behind the Return The Fund (RTF) to get a better
idea.**

The math for an RTF analysis is pretty simple:

Fund Size / % owned at exit = Minimum Viable Exit

To get a clear idea - **let's take an example** of an autonomous vehicle
startup built on the blockchain, X raising a $2M seed at a $10M Post money
valuation (Selling a 20% stake).

**VC Fund A is a $50M seed fund investing $1M**.

  * $1M/$10M valuation = 10% ownership 

  * In order to return the fund, X must exit for (50/.1) = $500M 

  * But over the period, Fund A wasn't able to invest in the next rounds (not maintain pro-rate thing ) so their stake got diluted. Assume dilution by 20%.

With this dilution by 20% - the real return of the fund number is $625M
($50M/.08). So in order to pass RTF (Return To Fund) analysis, VC Fund A must
believe that X will exit for at least $500M and more realistically $625M. This
is for some small funds like seed.

**Now let’s look at a larger fund model.**

VC Fund B is a $250M fund investing $1M in X.

  * $1M/$10M valuation = 10% ownership 

  * Return to Fund calculation: VC Fund B has to believe that X will exit for $2.5B ($250M fund / 10% stake). 

  * Assume this fund is able to invest in further rounds and able to get 5% extra which makes the stake 15% at exit.

VC Fund B has to believe that X will exit for $1.66B ($250M/15%) in that
increased ownership scenario.

But does the company really exit at $1.66B or more? What’s the past data say?
-

Let's look into this. If you look at data on equity ownership at exits, the
image below:

_Data till 2016 - on VC Backed Startups Exit_

As an investor, the difference between a company exiting for $500M vs. $2.5B
is not trivial. Less than 10% of all VC-backed exits in 2016 were $500M+, per
CB Insights.

As a founder, this trickles down to thinking about their potential investor’s
philosophy. While some startups are built to exit in the 100 of millions of
dollars, Larger funds could push through their natural exit points in order to
go for broke and hit a grand slam which is unlikely to occur. Return to the
fund (RTF) is a good barometer, but just one data point in the Due Diligence
Process.

It is a quick way to gut-check ownership and investment size and also allows
investors to think about how they will need to build their positions over
time. But while this thought process is generally useful, like all things in
startups, there are outliers.

One of the most interesting articles to read for all founders & investors.
Here is the summary:

The age-old statistic that it costs 5-25 times more to acquire a new customer
than to retain an existing one is more than just a mantra. It's a guiding
principle for SaaS executives like Gabe Miller-Smith, former SVP of Global
Customer Success at Procore.

In the early stages of a startup, it's easy to focus on acquiring new
customers. However, neglecting churn can lead to significant problems down the
line. It's crucial to remember, "If you can’t hold on to customers, you’ll
never be able to grow." Reducing churn and increasing net retention is
paramount, especially for startups. It's a "team sport," requiring the support
of the entire organization.

But what's a realistic target for net retention? According to Gabe, a 10%
churn rate is too high. "At Procore, I never had a churn target that was
greater than 9%," he says. Addressing churn involves understanding who’s
churning, why they’re churning, and when in their journey they’re churning.
It's about categorizing customer churn to identify patterns and developing
strategies to tackle the problem.

Gabe's team at Procore focused on automating processes, building certificate
programs, and setting up drip email campaigns. These initiatives helped
customers get value out of Procore faster and freed up customer success to
provide added counsel and support.

Looking ahead, predictive analytics could be a game-changer for customer
success teams. It's about knowing when customers are going to churn and
planning the next move. Remember, not all churn is obvious. Dig deep into your
data to uncover hidden issues. And keep in mind, net retention should be your
North Star metric.

And if you need a reminder, put the stat right above your desk: It costs 5-25x
more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one.

Recently we shared a[ tweet
](https://twitter.com/venturecrews/status/1696488449791189344)on PMF:

Most Founders think that initial signs of repeatable revenue growth, low
churn, happy customers, and customer referrals/word of mouth mean that they
find the PMF.

To be clear this is not the Product Market Fit (PMF), these are just signs of
early market validation. So what is exactly PMF for Startups?
