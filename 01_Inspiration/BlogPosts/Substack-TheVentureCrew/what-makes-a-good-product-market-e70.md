##### **TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

Product-market fit (PMF) is the mythical goal of early-stage startups — and
rightfully so. Once you have PMF you are at that point where you can shift
your daily focus from building something people want to getting what you’ve
built out into the world and making money.

Despite PMF being the central goal of an early-stage startup, it is not well
defined. Almost every definition of PMF I’ve seen from investors and
entrepreneurs is different — and often conflicting. There are tons of
definitions you will find on the internet -

These are good metrics, but before using them, founders often forget to ask
this question: **What makes a good product market fit metric?**

A strong product-market fit (PMF) metric should signal when your product is
ready for broader distribution, without leading you astray. Before reaching
PMF, your focus should be on refining your product to serve your current users
better. Once you achieve PMF, it’s time to shift your attention toward scaling
your acquisition channels.

A good PMF metric should minimize the chances of false positives and false
negatives. A false positive could lead you to start scaling too soon, causing
you to waste resources on acquiring users who may churn because the product
isn’t good enough yet. On the other hand, a false negative could delay your
growth efforts, allowing competitors to get ahead or causing you to miss
critical milestones, such as securing the next round of funding before your
runway runs out.

To summarize, a good product market fit metric:

  * Tells you when the product is good enough to work acquisition channels

  * Minimizes false positives - won’t tell you to work on acquisition channels when the product needs more improvement

  * Minimizes false negatives - will tell you to on acquisition channels as soon as the product is good enough, to maximize growth

You can use these points to evaluate the other definition of product market
fit.

**If you look at NPS:** Net Promoter Score (NPS) is often used to gauge
product-market fit, but it has limitations. While some of the world's biggest
tech companies have poor NPS, they still grow to millions or even billions of
users.

For example, Apple and Microsoft had NPS scores of about 47 and 45
respectively, while Google had only 11. Even more striking, Coca-Cola sat at
0, and Facebook had a negative score of -21.

This highlights a major issue with using NPS as a product-market fit metric:
it can lead to false positives and false negatives.

Just because a product has a low NPS doesn’t mean it can’t achieve massive
growth, and vice versa.

**Survey-Based Metrics**

A popular alternative to NPS is the **“40% Rule,** ” which measures product-
market fit by determining whether 40% of users would be “very disappointed” if
they could no longer use the product. Superhumans famously used this metric
for great success. While this is a stronger indicator of product-market fit
than NPS, survey-based metrics have their issues:

  1. **Response Bias** : Not all users respond to surveys, so the results you get might not fully represent your entire user base. Those who don’t respond might feel differently than those who do.

  2. **Timing** : The point at which you ask users this question can skew results. Asking too early may capture users when they are still excited while asking too late might exclude those who have already churned, thus biasing towards more engaged users.

  3. **Mismatch with Actual Behavior** : What users say they’ll do doesn’t always align with what they do. They might express enthusiasm for a feature in a survey, but then not use it once it’s launched.

Even though this metric is more reliable than NPS, it’s not foolproof and can
sometimes lead to false negatives. You might already have product-market fit
even if the survey doesn’t hit the 40% mark.

**Distribution and Product-Market Fit**

Some definitions of product-market fit include the need for effective
distribution channels. However, distribution shouldn’t be a part of the
product-market fit criteria. There’s ample evidence that certain distribution
channels, like SEO and referrals, generally work for most consumer companies.
These channels can provide a competitive edge, though they require effort and
time to scale.

Any product demonstrating strong cohort retention can be successfully scaled
with the right growth strategy. With the right execution, a product with good
retention can always find effective ways to grow.

**What is the Cohort Retention Rate?**

The cohort retention rate is a key metric for understanding how well your
product retains users over time. Unlike general retention metrics that mix
users with different levels of experience, cohort retention focuses on groups
of users who joined simultaneously. Here's how it works:

_Cohort retention rate_ \- This measures the percentage of a group of users (a
cohort) who stick around long-term after signing up during the same period.

For example, if you look at a cohort retention graph (Green Line) and see that
it levels off at 30%, it means that 30% of users from that cohort are still
using the product after a certain period. If the graph doesn’t flatten out, it
indicates that your retention rate is effectively 0%, meaning users aren’t
sticking around long-term.

**Why Cohort Retention Rate Matters**

You should see newer cohorts with higher retention rates as you improve your
product. You can use a cohort retention "triangle" chart to track this
progress. This chart helps visualize how retention rates change over time with
each new cohort.

For example, if you notice that retention improves significantly after a
certain date, it’s likely due to product enhancements made around that time.
Once multiple cohorts levelling off at a certain retention rate, you may have
reached product-market fit.

**Benchmarks for Cohort Retention**

Different types of products have different benchmarks for what constitutes
product-market fit.

  * **For consumer products,** a cohort retention rate of 25% is often considered the minimum,

  * while for **B2B SaaS products,** the floor is typically around 70%.

  * However, top-performing products often exceed these numbers, with great consumer products achieving over 40% and **B2B SaaS products** reaching over 80%.

**Why Cohort Retention Rate is a Strong Product-Market Fit Metric**

Cohort retention rate has several advantages over survey-based metrics:

  1. **No Response Bias** : It captures data from all users, not just those who take the time to fill out a survey.

  2. **Full User Lifecycle** : You get a complete view of how users engage with your product over time, rather than just at a single point.

  3. **Actual User Behavior** : It reflects what users are doing, not just what they say they will do.

While it’s beneficial to use both cohort retention and survey-based metrics,
the cohort retention rate is crucial for understanding true product-market
fit.

Overall

  * Actively measure your cohort retention rate using a “triangle” cohort retention chart

  * Find the retention rate of comparable successful products and set a product market fit goal

  * Improve your product and watch retention improve with new cohorts!

##### **QUICK DIVES**

As a founder, you're probably eager to wrap up your round and get back to
building your company. Makes sense - fundraising can be a huge time sink.

One powerful strategy **I've seen work well is using tranches**. Let me break
down what this means and how you can use it effectively.

**What exactly are tranches?** Simply put, tranches are different pricing
tiers in your fundraising round. Instead of raising everything at one
valuation, you segment your raise into parts. The early investors usually get
in at a lower valuation, creating an incentive for quick decisions.

**Why consider using tranches?** Early-stage startups are inherently risky,
and getting that first check is often the biggest hurdle. VCs tend to move
faster when they see other investors already committed. By offering early
investors a better deal, you're not just rewarding them - you're creating
momentum for your entire raise.

**How do investors typically react?** Most sophisticated investors understand
the game. They know that whether they got in at $5M or $10M won't matter much
if the company becomes really valuable. That said, there are some unwritten
rules:

  * Never offer worse terms to later investors than what early ones got

  * Be honest about your strategy and intentions

  * Don't string investors along just to create FOMO

**What's the best way to communicate new tranches?** Keep it natural.
Something like: "We opened a small initial allocation to move quickly, and now
we're raising the rest at a fair cap." Or if you're extending the round:
"We're seeing strong interest beyond our initial target, so we're considering
taking on additional capital while managing dilution."

**How many tranches should you use?** Keep it simple - two or three maximum.
Any more gets messy and complicated to manage.

**How should you size each tranche?** You've got three main approaches:

  * Small first tranche, bigger second (great for speed)

  * Large first tranche, small follow-on (better for controlling dilution)

  * Flexible sizing based on market response (good when you're testing the waters)

Remember, tranches are just a tool to help you close your round efficiently.
Used thoughtfully, they can create positive momentum and get you back to
focusing on what really matters - building your company.

**Before jumping into fundraising** , **you need the right pitch deck** that
can help you to scheduled a call with investor. We are team of investors,

“Figuring out” your startup’s TAM is somewhat useless. Most of the time it’s
made up (TAM - Totally Made-Up Number) or at least very generous, and everyone
knows it. But the real sin about TAM is that it’s just one giant number.

Sure, you have SAM and SOM as well but those aren’t much better. They don’t
tell you anything actionable like, for example, how ready to buy your market
is.

[The Buyer’s Pyramid](https://www.fishhookmarketing.com/chet-holmes-buyers-
pyramid-explained/) is a framework that divides your potential market into
five categories based on how likely they are to buy your product or service.
Spoiler alert: only 3% of your audience is actively shopping for what you
offer. Here’s the breakdown:

  * **Buying Now (3%)**  
These are your hot leads—the tiny sliver of people ready to purchase. They’re
already doing research, comparing options, and looking for the best deal. This
group is your low-hanging fruit but also your most competitive audience.

  * **Open to Buying (6–7%)**  
This group isn’t actively looking but could be convinced with the right offer.
Think: discounts, special promotions, or solutions to a problem they didn’t
know they had.

  * **Not Thinking About It (30%)**  
These people are _comfortable_ —they don’t feel the need to buy right now.
However, they’ll eventually move up the pyramid when their current solution
becomes outdated or inconvenient.

  * **Think They’re Not Interested (30%)**  
This group believes they don’t need what you’re offering, but with the right
messaging, you can nudge them toward seeing the value of your product.

  * **Know They’re Not Interested (30%)**  
The toughest audience—people who’ve recently purchased or are firmly against
buying. It’s not worth wasting your ad budget here.

Most businesses spend too much time chasing the top 3%, fighting over the same
small pool of customers. The Buyer’s Pyramid shows that _67% of your potential
market_ is in the middle layers, waiting to be educated, nurtured, and
persuaded.

What I like about the framework is that you can use different strategies for
each distinct user group, track performance with simple tagging when potential
customers are in your funnel, and audit whether you’re spending your time and
money most effectively with sales and marketing.

Investors pass on great opportunities every day simply because founders fail
to tell their story clearly. I've seen this happen too many times.

Here's a slide that founders can include in their pitch deck to improve
clarity for investors:

  1. **Why This Problem?**

Don't bore investors with TAM/SAM/SOM charts. Instead, show them the market
opportunity & real pain point and what it costs your customers. Make it
tangible.

  2. **Why This Solution?**

Break down your solution and why you chose this specific approach. Be concrete
about how you're solving the problem differently.

  3. **Why Now?**

Markets, tech, and human behavior are constantly shifting. Show investors why
your startup's moment is today, not yesterday or tomorrow.

  4. **Why You?**

What makes you and your team uniquely positioned to win? This isn't about your
resume - it's about why you're the right person to bet on.

Remember: How you communicate your startup's story reflects how you'll
communicate with customers, team members, and partners. Keep it sharp, keep it
clear, and own your narrative.
