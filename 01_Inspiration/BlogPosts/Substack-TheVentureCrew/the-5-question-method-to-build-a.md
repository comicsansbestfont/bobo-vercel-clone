##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

Every founder dreams of that perfect elevator pitch - a 30-second ride that
ends with millions in funding. While this movie scenario is unlikely, crafting
a compelling elevator pitch is crucial. It's often your startup's first
impression on potential investors, setting the stage for future conversations.
A well-honed pitch can open doors, even if it doesn't immediately open
wallets. So polish that pitch - you never know when you'll need it.

There are lots of articles surfing on the internet but still, many founders
struggle to create elevator pitches for their startups. So in today’s writeup,
I am going to share a “5 Question framework” that can help you to create an
elevator pitch.

Also, many founders believe that they just need to have one elevator pitch and
they can impress anyone. But this is not true, I believe you need to have
multiple versions of an elevator pitch like - The emotional benefit version,
the Success story version, the pressing call to action version and the version
where you reference competitors. I will share more ideas on how to create each
version of an elevator pitch. So let’s deep dive into this:

An elevator pitch won’t get someone to invest in your company, but it’s going
to whet their appetite and get you in the door. It’s thirty seconds long.
That’s the usual “rule” given for elevator pitches. You’ve got 30 seconds to
share an enormous amount of information about the company.

Your elevator pitch isn't about speed-talking; it's about impact. Every word
should count. This brief but powerful message isn't just for investors - it's
the essence of your company's identity. It'll shape your website's "About Us"
section and become the go-to description for everyone in your organization,
from the CEO to the newest intern. Think of it as your startup's movie poster:
a quick glimpse that tells your whole story and leaves people wanting more.

One of the most common questions that every founder has is - **“How long
should an elevator pitch be? Do I really only have 30 seconds?”**

Look, nobody's gonna time your pitch with a stopwatch. If it takes 31 seconds,
no biggie. But here's the thing: you can pack a lot into 30 seconds if you're
smart about it. If you're rambling on, it might be time to tighten things up.

Now, rules are made to be broken, right? Take Tesla. Their pitch is longer,
but damn if it isn't effective. Elon Musk might be in hot water lately, but
the guy knows how to sell an idea. Some folks can keep you hooked for a full
minute and leave you sold.

But let's be real - not everyone's Elon Musk. The 30-second thing is just a
guideline, not a hard rule. What matters is nailing your audience, the
situation, and your startup's value. That's the secret sauce.

So why bother with elevator pitches? Simple. They force you to boil down your
big idea into something snappy and memorable. It's like a first impression for
your business - make it count!

First off, it's all about grabbing attention. You've got this killer idea,
right? The elevator pitch is how you make someone else go "Whoa, tell me
more!" in just a few seconds.

It's not just for impressing investors, though that's a big part. Think
bigger. Remember how Steve Jobs lured John Sculley away from Pepsi with that
line about changing the world? That's the power of a great pitch.

Your elevator pitch is like your secret weapon. It's how you stand out at
crowded conferences, how you snag those first crucial customers, and how you
get top talent interested in joining your team. Hell, it's even what makes
your LinkedIn profile pop.

The key thing? It's gotta work on people who've never heard of you before.
That's where it differs from your pitch deck. It's your first impression, your
hook, your "here's why you should care" moment.

To re-iterate, the five basic pieces of information that will be contained in
an elevator pitch are:

  1. Who you are

  2. What you do

  3. How you do it

  4. Who you do it for (i.e. the customer) and

  5. Why now (the urgency of your idea)

And then, sitting on top of this is the need to make it accessible to the
listener. This means you need to assume that they’re not aware of your
business, or anything about the sector that you’re in.

Here's a great example of this. Here’s a pitch that was proving unsuccessful
for a startup:

“I work on nanotechnology to deliver medical therapies to targeted cells.”

It has all five of the elements of an elevator pitch in there. It covers:

  1. Who you are (a medical science company)

  2. What you do (medicine)

  3. How you do it (nanotechnology innovation)

  4. Who you do it for (people who need medicine)

  5. Why now (it improves the delivery of medicine)

Now, technically, it hits all the marks. But let's be real, unless you're deep
into nanotech, your eyes are probably glazing over already.

So they went back to the drawing board and came up with this: "We are using
the manufacturing techniques of the computer industry to make better
vaccines."

Boom! Way more accessible, right? It's less jargon but packs a bigger punch.
It's the kind of thing that makes people go, "Huh, tell me more."

And get this - that new pitch? It landed them an investment from the Bill
Gates Foundation. No joke.

The takeaway? Keep it simple, make it interesting, and for the love of all
that's holy, don't assume everyone knows what the hell you're talking about.
Your grandma should be able to get the gist of it, you know?

While building an elevator pitch, start by asking yourself these four
questions:

  1. Who's your audience?

  2. What's bugging them?

  3. How are you fixing it?

  4. How'll they know you've helped?

Now, here's a neat trick. There's this formula you can use to get started:

"You know how [your people] struggle with [their problem]? I've got [your
solution]. It helps them [the benefit] so they can [their goal]."

Let's say you've got this cool gadget that helps people find their lost stuff.
Your pitch might go something like:

"Ever been late 'cause you can't find your keys? Happens to tons of folks.
I've made this nifty Bluetooth thingy that helps you find lost stuff in
seconds. Makes mornings way less stressful, ya know?"

But here's the deal - don't just copy-paste this. Make it your own. Tweak it.
Play with it. The last thing you want is to sound like every other startup out
there.

Oh, and a pro tip? Don't BS your numbers. Investors can smell that a mile
away. Stick to the facts you know are solid. It'll make you sound way more
legit.

Remember, this is just your starting point. You'll want different versions for
different situations. Keep it fresh, keep it real, and most importantly, keep
it you.

**Why You Need Different Elevator Pitches**

Your elevator pitch shouldn't be one-size-fits-all. Having multiple versions
lets you tailor your message to different situations and audiences. Here are a
few types to consider:

  1. **The Emotional Appeal:** Focus on how your product makes people feel. This can be powerful for early customers and marketing.

  2. **The Success Story:** Once you have clients, share real-world examples of how you've helped them. This proves your value.

  3. **The Urgent Call-to-Action** : Sometimes you need to push for immediate interest. Craft a version that creates a sense of urgency.

  4. **The Competitor Comparison** : If you're entering a market with big players, explain how you're similar but different. "We're like X, but for Y."

  5. **The One-Liner:** Have a super-short version ready for quick encounters or social media.

Remember, context is key. The pitch you use with an investor in an actual
elevator will differ from the one you give after a conference presentation. By
preparing various approaches, you'll be ready to adapt on the fly and make the
most of every opportunity.

If you're a regular reader of this newsletter, you’ve seen us talk about
[Reddit lead-generation strategies for B2B
founders](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/160562677/how-bb-saas-
founders-can-use-reddit-to-drive-leads-a-step-by-step-guide).

Recently, I came across a founder who scaled his SaaS to $1M in revenue just
by using Reddit. No ads. No cold outreach. Just smart, consistent community
work. And I think there’s a lot to learn from how he did it.

Here’s the basic idea: Reddit is where people go when they want real answers.
Not AI-written blog posts. Not polished sales pages. Just honest, human
opinions. And now, because Google pushes Reddit posts to the top of search
results for all kinds of long-tail queries, being active there can get you
huge visibility — if you do it right.

Some interesting points he shared:

  * **Reddit shows up high in Google search results** for niche terms. So when people Google something like “best CRM for freelancers Reddit” — the top result is often a real conversation, not a company page.

  * **AI tools are trained on Reddit data.** So your helpful comments and posts might eventually influence what tools like ChatGPT say when someone asks for recommendations.

  * **Users are actively searching for help**

The founder didn’t show up spamming links to his startup. He started slow:

  * First, he found relevant subreddits where his target customers were already hanging out (with at least 50K+ members)

  * Then he spent time commenting, upvoting, and learning the tone of the community

  * Only after building karma and trust did he begin to post — and a few of those posts ended up with over 1M+ views

He used tools like [f5bot](https://f5bot.com) to track keywords across Reddit
— like pain points, competitor names, and industry-specific phrases. That way,
he could jump into discussions right when people were asking for help. These
weren’t cold leads — they were people in the middle of making buying
decisions.

When it came to posting, he followed a simple rule: **Give 95% value and 5%
plug.**

That means no hard selling. No direct links. Just useful, personal insights —
and only mentioning his product when it made sense.

Here are the types of posts that worked well for him:

  * **Relatable posts:** sharing a mistake or lesson he learned

  * **Guide-style posts:** like the one I’m referencing here

  * **Conversation starters:** asking a smart or thought-provoking question

  * **Story posts:** walking through a behind-the-scenes moment or customer win

And always — write like a real person. Reddit has a sixth sense for BS. You
try too hard to sell, and you’re ignored (or banned). But if you genuinely
help people, they _will_ check your profile, ask for your product, or even
invite you to share more.

Honestly, I think this is one of the smartest early-stage growth plays for
technical or solo founders right now. If you’re building something for a niche
audience and want real users and feedback — Reddit is where the conversations
are already happening.

Attention spans aren’t getting shorter.

People are just getting _better_ at making decisions about whether they want
to keep paying attention or not.

They might only consider your product for a split second before they decide.

Your landing page, social media content, or ad needs to hook them right away
and then hold their attention each step of the way towards a conversion.

Here’s how to improve it:
