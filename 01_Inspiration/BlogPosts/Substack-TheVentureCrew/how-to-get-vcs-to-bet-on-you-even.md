##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

Here’s a well-known secret: VCs hate crowded spaces.

If a bunch of companies are chasing the same problem, it means brutal
competition for customers, which usually means higher costs and slower growth.
Not exactly what investors dream of.

**But here’s the flip side: some companies** _**do**_**win in crowded
markets**. And when the market is big enough, VCs will still invest. The key?
They need to believe they’re betting on the right startup.

So, if you’re a founder building in a competitive space, the real question is:
how do you stand out?

That’s exactly what we’re diving into today.

To make this real, let’s talk about a space that’s super crowded: AI.
(Agree??)

Specifically, AI-powered sales development representatives (SDRs) tools help
sales teams find and qualify leads faster.

(From my VC friend: We see at least one AI SDR startup every week. There are
plenty more out there raising money. So yeah, it’s competitive.)

That said, sales as an industry has a huge total addressable market (TAM), and
AI is, well, everywhere right now. VCs want to invest in this space. But only
if they believe a startup can return 100 their money. ([Can your startup
return VC funds?](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/155318590/steps-to-
know-if-your-company-can-return-a-vc-fund))

**Which brings us to the challenge:**

  * How do you prove you won’t stall after some early traction?

  * How do you avoid insanely high customer acquisition costs?

  * How do you convince VCs you’re the one to bet on?

**The answer:** find a market wedge.

A wedge is simply a strategy to win a large market by initially capturing (1)
a tiny part of a larger market or (2) a large part of a small adjacent market.

So if you want to break into a crowded market, don’t try to be “just another
AI sales tool.” Instead, specialise.

Example: Instead of being a generic AI SDR, you could be the AI SDR for
veterinarians.

**Why? Because focusing on a niche:**

  * Gives you a clear target audience with a unique need.

  * Makes customer acquisition _way_ easier.

  * Helps you stand out from the sea of generic competitors.

**But VCs won’t just ask, “What’s your wedge?” They’ll ask, “How do you grow
beyond it?”**

Here’s where your expansion strategy comes in:

  1. Vertical Expansion – Offer more services to your niche.

     * You start with AI-powered sales for vets.

     * Then add appointment scheduling, inventory management, etc.

  2. Horizontal Expansion – Expand to similar industries.

The key is to show investors that you’re thinking beyond today’s niche and
into tomorrow’s empire.

**Getting Customers (Without Burning Cash)**

A wedge is great. But without customers, it’s just a nice idea. VCs want to
see that you can acquire customers efficiently.

If you already have industry connections amazing. Maybe you:

But what if you _don’t_ have these connections? That’s where partnerships can
be a game-changer.

For example, if you’re targeting veterinarians, you could:

  * Partner with a Medical Association to tap into their network.

  * Work with private equity firms that acquire vet clinics (and need them to grow).

  * Get backing from VCs specialising in pet tech, who can open doors.

> The goal is simple: show VCs you can acquire customers from day one without
> breaking the bank.

Here’s another tip: VCs love learning.

If a founder teaches them something they didn’t know, it makes them _way_ more
likely to invest.

**That means your job is to be the expert.** You should know more about your
niche than anyone in the room.

How do you prove that?

  * **Challenge common assumptions:** _“_ Everyone thinks X about the veterinary industry, but actually, it’s Y.”

  * **Drop surprising insights:** _“_ Did you know 73% of pet owners would pay more for AI-enhanced vet services?” (Okay, I made that up, but you get the idea.)

  * **Offer a fresh perspective:** Explain why your approach makes more sense than the status quo.

And don’t shy away from the competition. **Yes, the market is crowded but
that’s because the opportunity is massive.** If you can prove you understand
the market better than anyone else, you position yourself as the founder VCs
want to back.

So, if you’re in a crowded space and want to win investors over, here’s what
you need to do:

  * Find your market wedge a niche that gives you an entry point.

  * Show how you’ll expand beyond that wedge over time.

  * Prove you can acquire customers efficiently (without insane costs).

  * Know your market better than anyone else in the room.

In a crowded market, the loudest voices don’t win the smartest, most strategic
ones do.

So be different. Challenge assumptions. And make it impossible for investors
to ignore you.

Who knows? Maybe your AI-powered vet sales tool _is_ the next unicorn. Just
don’t forget the little people when you make it big.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Most of us assume that if people are using a product, it must be making their
lives better. But what if that’s not true?

In a powerful [new study](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/insight/research-
summary/when-product-markets-become-collective-traps-the-case-of-social-
media/) from the University of Chicago’s Leonardo Bursztyn, the study shows
that platforms like TikTok and Instagram may actually reduce overall well-
being, even for the people who actively use them.

**Here’s how they tested this idea:**

They ran a large online experiment with 1,000 college students to understand
the true value of social media. The twist? They measured not just how much
people enjoy using these platforms, but how much it bothers them not to use
them when everyone else does.

**Key findings:**

  * On average, TikTok users would need to be paid $59 to give it up for a month. But when asked how much they’d pay to shut down everyone’s accounts, including their own, they’d actually be willing to pay $28 for that.

  * For Instagram, users would need $47 to step away, but would pay $10 to take the whole platform offline for themselves and their peers.

  * It gets starker: non-users of TikTok said they’d pay $67 just to make everyone else delete their accounts. For Instagram, it was $39.

  * Once you factor in the “spillover effects” (aka, the Fear of Missing Out), the paper finds that 64% of TikTok users and 48% of Instagram users are actually worse off because these platforms exist at all.

  * The catch: they’d feel even worse if they alone opted out while everyone else stayed online. So they stay trapped by network effects.

**Why this matters:**

The study introduces a concept called a _“collective trap”_ : situations where
the popularity of a product increases pressure to participate, even when it
makes many people unhappy.

It also shows this dynamic isn’t limited to social media. The same effects
appear in luxury goods and tech:

  * 44% of luxury brand owners (e.g., Gucci, Rolex) said they’d rather live in a world where none of those brands existed.

  * A staggering 91% of iPhone users said they’d prefer Apple release new iPhones only every other year. Among non-iPhone users, it was 94%.

In short, just because a product is widely used doesn’t mean it’s making
people better off.

Here’s what founders should take away:

  1. **Don’t confuse usage with genuine value.**  
Just because people are logging in doesn’t mean they want to be there. Some
users stick around because they fear being left out, not because they’re
deriving real utility. That’s not sustainable, and it's not product love.

  2. **Look deeper than metrics like DAUs, Power user curves and retention.**  
Ask yourself: Would people still use this if their friends didn’t? Would they
pay to make the whole thing disappear? These questions reveal whether you're
creating value or just building a collective trap.

  3. **Design to serve, not pressure.**  
Platforms built on FOMO, guilt, or status-chasing may grow fast, but they risk
turning into zero-sum ecosystems. Instead, ask: Does my product make people
feel better, more empowered, more fulfilled, independently of what others are
doing?

  4. **Build for intrinsic utility.**  
Products that people use because they want to, not because they have to, are
far more likely to build lasting impact and trust.

  5. **Consider negative externalities.**  
Think about what your product does to non-users. If your success creates
social pressure, envy, or disconnection for others, don’t ignore it. That’s
part of your real-world footprint.

Full paper: [When Product Markets Become Collective Traps
(BFI)](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/insight/research-summary/when-product-markets-
become-collective-traps-the-case-of-social-media/)

A counterintuitive tip about startups is that more customer support tickets
are a sign of product-market fit.

If users didn’t love the solution your product was offering to a painful
problem, they wouldn’t care enough to write in support tickets. And more
tickets = more users.

But **when support tickets grow at an exponential rate, they become a
problem** where you simply can’t get to all of them and still work on the
product, growing it, managing the team, talking to investors, etc.

So how do you solve that?

Most people’s first instinct is to hire a customer support person, but this is
almost always the wrong first move:

  1. You take yourself further away from your users, making it more complex to understand their issues.

  2. If your startup keeps growing, you’ll just have the same problem again soon.

Instead, take Jessica Livingston’s (Founding Partner of Y-Combinator) advice
(below) and focus on making the product better.

Most ideas, especially in B2C, get validated in one of four ways:

**[This framework](https://www.consumerstartups.com/p/idea-validation-
framework-backed)** defines the differences between each path to validation.

  1. **Signal Aggregation**

Founders should test an idea's viability through small experiments that
provide evidence (signals) of potential success before building a full
product.

Common signals include landing page sign-ups, social media engagement, ad
click-through rates, and customer interview feedback.

  2. **Strong Beta**

Achieving strong early traction with a beta product is another popular
validation approach for founders. Success metrics vary across industries,
e.g., high user numbers and retention for consumer social apps, and healthy
revenue for B2C marketplaces.

The process typically starts with a hypothesis for solving a problem. The
founder builds a basic version to test the hypothesis. Beta products are often
rudimentary, lacking polish, due to the emphasis on speed over perfection.
This approach aligns with the lean methodology of launching quickly and
iterating based on feedback.

  3. **True Fans**

This approach is similar to the Strong Beta approach, as it involves launching
a beta product. However, instead of focusing on significant traction metrics
like revenue or user acquisition, the founder seeks to identify a small group
of fanatic users who deeply love the product despite its limited features. The
key is finding 20-50 users who would be disappointed if the product were to go
away. These passionate fans, rather than large user numbers, serve as the
validation signal.

  4. **Visionary**

This approach is the least common among the founders interviewed, as it
requires a clear vision and plan for the product from the outset. Typically,
the founder has a close personal connection to the problem being solved and a
strong understanding of what needs to be done to address it.
