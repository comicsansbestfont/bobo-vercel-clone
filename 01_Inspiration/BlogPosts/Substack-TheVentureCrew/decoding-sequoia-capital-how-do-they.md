In the world of investing, there's no need to start from scratch. One way to
amplify our own investing skills is to just study the best and try to adapt as
much of their thinking into our strategy. Among the giants of the venture
capital landscape stands Sequoia Capital, a powerhouse founded by Don
Valentine in 1972. Today, it reigns as the top VC firm globally, commanding
immense respect and attracting a flood of eager investors whenever its name is
mentioned. In this captivating write-up, we will explore the remarkable
strategies that have propelled Sequoia Capital to its unrivalled position.

Let’s continue from above….

Even with the transition in management to Michael Moritz and Doug Leone, the
firm continues to maintain its leading reputation. In 2019, Sequoia became
even bold by making more new seed-stage investments than Series A deals. This
is due to the fact that Hurun Research Institute identified Sequoia as the
world’s top unicorn investor, noting it had invested in one in five of all
private companies valued at $1 billion or more. WHAT.

One VC firm was in on 1/5 private unicorns in the entire world? This is even
more impressive considering they do not necessarily invest everywhere in the
world, even though they do have operations in Europe, China, India and
elsewhere. If that weren’t enough, 1200 of their long-term investments from
the past contain 300 IPOs. An astounding 25% going to market. Oh my. With that
kind of track record, if I could get in, it would be a no-brainer to have some
of my money invested by Sequoia. Alas, that is not the case so will have to
make do with other alternatives.

Investing as if we were thinking like Sequoia could be a good place to start,
given the successes they’ve had:

1970s-1990s: Apple, Cisco, Google, Nvidia, Webvan, Oracle, Cisco, Microchip
Technology, LSI Logic, Linear Technology, Network Appliance

2000s: Airbnb, Palo Alto Networks, ServiceNow, Unity Technologies, Youtube

2010s: 23andMe, StarkWare Industries, Instacart, Klarna, Nubank, Snowflake,
Stripe, WhatsApp, UiPath

2020s: BitClout, Bolt, FTX, Wiz, Loom, Shein, StrongDM

**Don Valentine**

Direct, blunt, and candid, Don was the founder and managing partner from
1972–1996 and made several notable investments prior to the 2000s. He noticed
the trend of technology and began making personal investments in technology
companies. What’s most interesting is that at the time of the founding, he did
not make the name of the company named after himself, but rather after trees
that are the largest, oldest, and tallest in the world. That seems to
represent humility, long-term thinking, and durability and may translate into
the types of founders that he himself was additionally sought after.

Given the large size of Sequoia, it would make sense that the companies he
looked for were involved in large market sizes, with TAMs, total addressable
markets that were already gigantic, and potentially that could even increase
in size. Large markets typically are already saturated with a wealth of
competition. So, it stands that the large markets targeted will be markets
that are not obvious to the majority, or they would already be filled. Don’s
bet on Apple led to an entirely new market, which didn’t even exist at the
time, but now seems more like a necessity as opposed to its initial luxury,
and even undiscovered market. His initial specialized knowledge of
microprocessors from his work experience led to personal computers which led
him to invest in Steve Jobs.

Somewhat counterintuitively, Don did not place the same emphasis on the
founder as VC firms do typically. He looks first at the biggest markets and
then looks for the people to fill those markets. Products that can disrupt
existing markets, or that can create new market categories that people
actually need or want, are what make a good opportunity.

He has no consideration towards the educational background of a person; some,
in fact, had no ability to run businesses but with the product idea, were set
up with reputable people from business backgrounds to help run the business
side. The founder must be mission focused on getting a new invention out
there; if they are in it for the money, he will not consider these types of
founders. The people he invested in typically have a strong technical
knowledge of technology and engineering. Only then would marketing and sales
come into play. Don was the one who knocked on the founder’s doors, rather
than VCs typically having founders call them first.

The art of storytelling is very important; be able to tell good stories that
can convince people to follow you. Knowing how to ask good meaningful
questions, particularly concise questions in under 20 words, is also a good
skill to learn on the social communication side. Having post mortems on failed
companies to see what went wrong is a good way to improve future decision-
making, which Sequoia does for every company they invested wrongly into. He
also cautions, similarly to Charlie Munger, that knowing what you don’t know
is very important, and perhaps more important than what you actually know. In
terms of timing, the best time to invest is in bear markets, as there is more
opportunity.

**Doug Leone**

Doug Leone was hired on by Don and later made managing partner and owner
alongside Michael Moritz. He was the managing partner from 1996 until 2022.
Doug likes to look for someone with strong strengths, that achieved an
improbable unusual success, particularly at an early age. If not in business
directly, other achievements when younger could signal success.

We want to be partners with entrepreneurs from day one; we know that after
many years, DNA is set in the first 60–90 days. This can be seen in a person’s
history. When they were younger, did they try to set up businesses? Such as
lemonade stands, lawn mowing, app creation, etc. Someone who started as a kid
has the DNA of an entrepreneur. Someone who started something on the side
while working is as well. Someone who just wants the glamour, status and money
of being a successful entrepreneur would not fit the mould.

In terms of finding great people, Doug Leone believes that exceptional
individuals have a unique ability to attract other exceptional individuals.
They stand out because there aren't many of them, and they can easily
recognize each other. One important characteristic of a great founder is their
use of the word "we" instead of "I." They have a team mentality and aren't
just focused on themselves. Another advantage of small teams is that they tend
to perform better than larger teams, where too many opinions can slow down
decision-making. Small teams can make decisions quickly and learn from
mistakes more efficiently.

Startups benefit from being small because they can maintain their stealth and
speed. It's important to avoid spending too much time and money on the
cocktail circuit, attending fancy conferences and networking events. Instead,
it's better to find one strong believer who can provide financial backing and
focus on creating a superior product, rather than seeking the support of
lukewarm believers for a mediocre product.

Some venture capital firms have been unable to generate positive returns for a
long time, yet they continue to raise funds. To find more opportunities, it's
worth looking abroad at untapped and rapidly expanding markets that may not
have the same level of scrutiny as developed markets. In the 2000s, Doug set
up separate teams in China and India to run operations, showing his humility
in recognizing that he doesn't fully understand consumers and businesses in
those countries. These markets hold great potential for future growth and may
uncover hidden gems that could outperform even those in the US. Larger
populations in these big markets offer even greater potential returns for
market winners. A notable example is Shein, a Chinese clothing retailer that
has surpassed its competitors with its affordable prices and efficient supply
chain, similar to Zara but even better.

Sequoia Capital's incredible success story is truly inspiring. From backing
tech giants like Apple and Google to being a top investor in unicorn
companies, their track record is unparalleled. While we may not have the
chance to invest directly with them, we can learn from their strategies to
enhance our own financial journeys. Join us as we explore the secrets of
Sequoia Capital and strive for financial success together. Stay tuned for more
