Spencer Rascoff grew Zillow from seed to IPO. But everyday investors missed
pre-IPO gains.

**"I wish we had done a round accessible to retail investors prior to Zillow's
IPO,"** Rascoff later said.

Now he’s fixing that with
[Pacaso](https://invest.pacaso.com/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=paid-
partnership&utm_campaign=partnership241-558_05-23_10758330809), his n**ew
company disrupting the $1.3T vacation home market.** And unlike Zillow, you
can invest in Pacaso as a private company.

After 41% gross profit growth last year, Pacaso’s ready for what’s next. They
even reserved the Nasdaq ticker PCSO. But no need to wait.

**[Invest in Pacaso for $2.80/share before Thursday’s

##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

During conversations with VCs, entrepreneurs will often encounter a few sneaky
questions that have nothing to do with their actual businesses today. Many of
these are ​attempts ​by investors to learn something specific that they don’t
want to ask directly, and there’s usually some kind of hidden meaning behind a
given question. Some VCs may just be fishing for more information, but many
are looking for specific “right” answers.

It’s a funny dance, ​and while experienced ​entrepreneurs know what’s going on
and how to respond, these questions can easily trip up a founder going through
​the fundraising process for the first time.

Previously we have shared 9 weird questions that always made to think founders
including:

  * What if Google Builds It? 

  * I don’t think this can be a venture-scale business.

  * We’d be interested when we see a bit more traction. 

  * Come back when you have a lead. 

  * Why hasn’t this been done before? 

  * Contact us if you like but we prefer warm introductions. 

  * What’s the moat? (for a seed stage). 

  * How can this be a billion-dollar company? 

  * “Yes but what *traction* do you have?” & “Your valuation is so HIGH now!”

You can read this in our[ archive post
here](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/154278029/annoying-questions-from-
vc-and-how-to-turn-them-around).

Now, I’m sharing a few more questions that you might hear from VCs. Of course,
it’s always best to be honest and authentic so this is not a proposed script,
but rather additional context to incorporate into your thinking.

**What they’re really asking:** “Is there a really big business here and is
this founder going to grind it out to get there?” Another sneaky way to ask
this question is something like, “Why would you even raise money for this
business?”

This is often a way to understand potential founder-investor alignment. As a
founder, it’s important to remember that you should really only talk to VCs if
you believe you’re working on a venture-scale business that can produce
hundreds of millions of dollars or more in revenue or value. In these cases,
the goal should be an outsized exit to another company or an IPO.

Obviously, not every company a VC backs accomplishes this (most don’t). And of
course, thousands of great businesses are built every year without any need
for venture capital. But for most VCs to get a return, they need to make sure
that every company in which they invest at least has a shot at larger
outcomes.

They also need to believe that the founders they back are in it to build a
great business in the long haul and won’t be tempted by smaller-scale exits
along the way.

These exits might enrich the founding team but leave the[ VC with a mediocre
outcome](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/159314417/size-matters-to-vcs-
how-to-pitch-your-market-to-investors). And while there are ways to deal with
this along the way (e.g. founder liquidity), you shouldn’t mention it during
an early-stage fundraising process.

**Answer:** “I think about this all the time, and I can’t seem to find any
compelling evidence that suggests that this can not be a large, independent,
public company.”

**What they’re really asking:** “How fast do I need to move here as an
investor? How much heat is there around this deal? Is this a ‘shopped’ deal?”

In this case, the VC is definitely fishing for information. You may not give
them any, but it doesn’t hurt for them to ask. As a founder, your best bet is
to convey real momentum if you can. Just know that the VC will remember what
you said if things unfold differently.

For example, if you say, “I have a couple of partner meetings next week and
think I’ll have a term sheet pretty soon,” then you’d better have some sort of
deal in hand by the end of next week. Otherwise, investors will think that you
lied, you misread the situation, and/or those other firms passed. Regardless,
you’ll be on your heels.

**Answer:** “We are just starting our process but have had a few meetings and
are getting great feedback. Things are moving really fast, so I’d like to get
some indication of interest within three to four weeks, and then choose the
right partner shortly after that.”

The general advice here is, to tell the truth and convey that you have
momentum and are confident that some sort of a deal will come together soon. I
wouldn’t overplay your hand around timing or investor interest, however, until
you’re very sure that you’re getting a term sheet. But after that, use that
term sheet as leverage for other conversations. Even if it’s not from the
world’s greatest firm, you can use it as a forcing function to get other VCs
to move. But if you don’t have at least 90 percent certainty that a term sheet
is coming, then I wouldn’t be as specific.

The suggested answer above is similar to the common response from many good
companies. It’s a good response because it communicates a few things:

  1. There are other interested VCs in the mix.

  2. But this deal hasn’t been overly shopped to investors.

  3. And there is a loosely established, reasonable timeline that requires a given investor to move with conviction.

Investors will make up their own minds about whether they believe your reply
here, but it’s still a reasonably solid “baseline” response.

> As an aside: Never name potential investors unless you’re completely
> convinced they’ll give you a ringing endorsement should a given VC call
> them. If you find yourself being pressed for names, you can just say
> something noncommittal like, “There are only so many investors that are
> great at X (e.g. early-stage e-commerce), and we are speaking to some of the
> usual suspects.”

If the investor really presses with no good reason, then they are just being
sad and you should move on immediately. The best investors make up their own
minds.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

[Greg Isenberg](https://x.com/gregisenberg/) recently put a name to a trend
many founders, investors, and operators have been quietly noticing: vibe
revenue.

> It’s when a product brings in money not because it’s solving a persistent
> problem but because it’s new, exciting, and everyone wants to try it. The
> danger? It looks a lot like real product-market fit… until the music stops.

**What is vibe revenue?**

Vibe revenue comes from curiosity, hype, and FOMO, not from necessity. It’s
like when you buy a flashy gadget, use it for a week, and then forget it
exists. In the startup world, this kind of revenue often shows up on pitch
decks as “ARR,” creating the illusion of sustainable traction.

Especially in AI, we’re seeing a surge of companies with early traction and
big VC checks but under the hood, much of the revenue isn’t sticky. Users
aren’t deeply engaged. They’re just curious.

Here’s how you can recognize vibe revenue:

  * Fast early conversions

  * Strong growth in the first few months

  * Weak retention after months 3–6

  * Little to no account expansion

  * High user churn when competitors pop up

**The vibe revenue cycle**

  1. Launch a shiny demo – It wows early adopters.

  2. Signups explode – Everyone wants to try the cool new thing.

  3. VCs get excited – The growth graphs look amazing.

  4. A big round is raised – The company is suddenly worth 9 figures.

  5. Reality sets in – The product isn’t critical to the user’s workflow.

  6. Growth plateaus – But few talk about it publicly.

  7. Zombie phase – The money’s there, but the product’s stuck.

Many startups in the AI boom of 2023–2024 are between steps 4 and 5. The
reckoning hasn’t hit yet but it’s coming.

**The dangerous part? It** _**looks**_**like PMF**

For the first few months, vibe revenue mimics real product-market fit. The
metrics look great:

But those same users eventually drift away. Why? Because the product never
became essential. The honeymoon ends, and so does the hype.

**Why AI makes vibe revenue even trickier**

The twist in today’s AI wave: these products do work. Unlike past hype cycles
(think Web3 or metaverse), AI tools can actually deliver value. ChatGPT,
Midjourney, and others create instant “wow” moments.

The problem is sustainability. Are these tools built into daily workflows? Do
they solve persistent problems? Or are they just... fun to play with for a
while?

**Competitive moats disappear overnight**

AI products are evolving fast. What felt like a defensible edge one month can
be wiped out the next by a newer model, a slicker interface, or a lower price.
Users are quick to switch. Loyalty is low. Switching costs are nonexistent.

Even startups that do have early PMF are at risk if they don’t evolve fast
enough.

**How to tell if it’s vibe revenue**

If you’re a founder, investor, or operator, ask yourself:

  * Are users coming back consistently?

  * Are they embedding this tool into their daily work?

  * Is usage growing within existing accounts?

  * Is retention strong past month 6?

  * Do people complain when pricing changes—or do they churn without a fight?

Strong cohort retention is the[ clearest signal of real
PMF](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/147653089/what-makes-a-good-
product-market-fit-metric-is-cohort-retention-rate-the-best-metric-for-pmf).
If that curve is bending downward, you’ve got a problem.

> Strong cohort retention means that users who start using your product keep
> coming back over time—week after week, month after month.

**Real vs. vibe businesses**

**Real AI businesses:**

  * Replit and Cursor: deeply integrated in developer workflows

  * Anthropic and OpenAI: foundational infrastructure

  * Perplexity: shifting from novelty to real research use

  * Bolt: layered AI on top of years of core product work

**Vibe businesses:**

  * AI companions with novelty, no retention

  * Productivity tools that are just ChatGPT with a new skin

  * Shiny demos with zero workflow integration

The difference? It’s not the tech. It’s the habitual use.

**A coming correction?**

We’re likely 12–18 months away from a major shakeout. Companies that raised
big based on vibe revenue will struggle to raise again. Some may become
[“zombies” well-funded
](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/162346705/signs-your-startup-is-a-
zombie-and-how-to-avoid-it)but going nowhere. Employees will leave. Investors
will lose patience.

But this isn’t an AI winter. The tech is too transformative. What’s coming is
a maturity curve where only the strongest survive.

**How to build beyond the vibe**

If you’re building an AI startup today, focus on:

  * Retention: Make the product something people can’t work without

  * Workflow integration: Become a daily tool, not a demo

  * Defensibility: Through community, proprietary data, and real switching costs

  * Solving real pain points: Not just delivering impressive outputs

The winning companies won’t be the ones with the most viral demos on X.
They’ll be the ones that become indispensable products that still matter long
after the initial excitement fades.

Let’s be honest: fundraising is brutal.

It’s like running a full-time sales process you can’t hand off to anyone else.
You need to stay endlessly optimistic even if you’ve just been ghosted or
rejected for the tenth time that week.

But here’s the part no one talks about: how do you keep growing your startup
while fundraising? Many founders ask this question, and I’ve seen quite a few
get overwhelmed and frustrated in the process. So I thought I’d share a few
thoughts on how to manage both effectively.

Most early-stage startups don’t have the luxury of pressing pause on growth.
Yet investors still expect momentum even as you’re deep in back-to-back pitch
meetings. That tension is real, especially for tiny teams where the founders
are doing everything.

So how do you juggle both?

**Step one: prepare to shift gears**

Fundraising isn’t a side project. If you’re the CEO, you’ll need to clear your
schedule and fully commit to building your deck, telling your story, and
closing the round. That means offloading as much of your day-to-day as
possible before you hit the fundraising trail.

Look at everything on your plate and ask:

This exercise is about ruthless prioritization. The Eisenhower Matrix can help
it’s a simple framework that breaks your work into four buckets:

**1\. Important + Urgent: Do these now**

Think fire drills, things you can’t delay. Ask your co-founder to step up and
take the lead here so you can focus on fundraising. Yes, even if they’re
introverted and hate sales. Yes, even if they’re in another time zone. This is
crunch time, and everyone has to stretch.

**2\. Urgent but not important: Delegate**

Things like customer support, scheduling, or follow-up stuff that needs doing
but doesn’t need you. Train your team, outsource, or automate. Document your
processes if you haven’t already. It’ll help now and in the long run.

**3\. Important but not urgent: Schedule**

These are meaningful projects that matter but don’t need to happen today. Push
them to a post-fundraising timeline. Block off time on your calendar later in
the year so they don’t fall through the cracks.

**4\. Neither important nor urgent: Cut them**

Do pet projects or half-baked ideas float around? Let them go. Not everything
needs to be done. Freeing up headspace is a win.

Give yourself 1–4 weeks to make the shift

This transition doesn’t happen overnight. Expect it to take a few weeks,
depending on how complex your role is. But trust me it’s worth it. Trying to
raise money and run your startup without prepping for this handoff is a fast
track to burnout.
