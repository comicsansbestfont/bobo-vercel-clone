##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

When raising funds, many founders struggle to grasp how investors evaluate
opportunities. A common frustration is: _"Investors passed on our startup
because they didn’t think it would deliver strong enough returns."_

Previously, we shared a post on [how to determine whether your startup is
venture-backable](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/why-your-startup-idea-
isnt-big-enough-253), along with a framework for assessing it. This time,
let’s dive deeper into the math behind venture capital investing—because
understanding how investors think about money can provide clarity on why they
make certain decisions.

[Rob Go](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robgo/), co-founder of Nextview Ventures,
wrote an insightful piece on how venture investors calculate returns. He broke
down some key concepts that many founders overlook. I’m sharing a few of his
points here, along with some of my own thoughts.

There are plenty of articles online about VC multiples and how they’re
calculated. But I’ve always wondered: Do people truly appreciate how difficult
it is to generate these kinds of returns? And are they calculating multiples
in a way that reflects reality?

At a basic level, a return multiple is calculated by dividing the amount
returned by the amount invested.

But things get tricky when multiples are inferred from incomplete data. In
most cases, only the fund managers know exactly how much was invested and how
much was returned. And when you’re working with incomplete data, multiple
assumptions come into play.

Here are a few factors to consider when evaluating or estimating returns:

One of the most overlooked aspects of calculating VC returns is dilution—every
new financing round reduces early investors’ ownership stake.

Let’s walk through a common scenario:

A seed investor puts in $1M at a $10M post-money valuation in a startup’s
first funding round. The company eventually sells for $200M.

At first glance, it might seem like the seed investor made 20X their money
($200M / $10M). But in reality, that’s rarely how things play out.

Most startups raise more money as they grow, often at higher valuations. Every
time this happens, existing shareholders get diluted. Companies also expand
their option pool, further reducing investor ownership.

Here’s what that looks like for our seed investor:

  * The startup raises another $10M at a $50M post-money valuation.

  * As part of this round, the company expands its option pool by 10%.

After this financing, the seed investor’s original 10% stake is diluted:

  * 20% dilution from new investors.

  * 10% dilution from the expanded option pool.

  * The investor’s final stake is now 7% at exit.

So instead of getting a 20X return, their $1M investment turns into $14M—a 14X
return. Still great, but quite different from what the simple math suggested.

Another way to frame this:  
At the seed stage, the investor paid $1M for 10%. But after dilution, they
effectively paid $1M for 7%, meaning their real entry valuation was $14.3M
($1M / 7%).

And this is in a simplified scenario with just one additional round. In
reality, most startups raise multiple rounds, meaning dilution continues at
each step, further adjusting investor returns.

Below is a sample outcome table for a few scenarios.

**What this shows is that the** investor’s multiple dramatically changes
depending on how many rounds of financing occur after the initial round and
the level of dilution of each round.

You can also think about this in terms of effective post-money because it
creates a more visceral reaction. If this company goes on to raise multiple
financing rounds such that new investors and future employees end up with an
additional 50%, the seed investor mathematically invested at a $20M post-money
valuation. Still good, but not what you think of as seed-stage prices.

> This is why celebrating big financings isn’t always such a great thing.
> Apart from the screwed-up incentives that can arise from overcapitalized
> companies, each time a company raises money, all prior investors get
> diluted, which increases the effective post-money of all the earlier
> dollars.

But one might say that this is precisely why it’s important to invest follow-
on capital — it helps you protect your ownership. This is true, sort of, but
leads to another misconception about multiples:

> One needs to consider all the dollars someone invests into a company at each
> round, not just the initial round.

The problem with follow-on financings is that they have a similar effect on
future dilution. **Each time an investor puts money into a follow-on round,
she preserves her ownership, but increases her cost basis and effective post
money.**

Back to our hypothetical company and angel investor that invested $1M at $10M
post. Let’s say that the company raises just one more subsequent round of
financing which is a $10M at $50M post again. But this time, let’s assume the
seed investor decides to “lean in” and write a $2M check at this stage. So,
what happens is:

  * The investor bought 10% of the seed

  * The investor also bought another 4% at the Series A

  * The investor invested $3M total

  * The investor’s seed dollars got diluted by 30%

So, the final ownership is (10% x 70%) + 4% = 11%. Since the investor
increased ownership, they did “super-pro-rata” in a company they thought was a
winner. The company then sells for $200M.

Quick: Is this investment a 10X for the seed investor who initially invested
at a $10M post-money valuation?

> The answer is NO. The investor made 11% x $200M = $22M. They invested $3M to
> get there. So it was a 7.3X with an effective post-money of $27M. Pretty
> good, but not a 10X return.

This effect is even greater if the investor puts capital into multiple future
financing rounds, even if they just keep doing their pro-rata share of the
round. The example above is simplistic, and I’d argue that 70%+ of $200M exits
happen with more future dilution than this.

  1. **Why investment multiples can be misleading**

It’s easy to assume that a seed investor putting $1M into a $10M post-money
valuation will see a 10X return if the company exits at $200M. But in reality,
small changes—like dilution from follow-on rounds—can quickly turn a 20X
outcome into less than 10X. And that’s assuming no down rounds or recaps,
which make things even trickier.

  2. **VCs need bigger exits than most assume**

When VCs talk about 10X returns, it’s easy to underestimate the exit size
needed to achieve that. Even a 3–5X return often requires a much bigger exit
than expected. This creates tension—founders may see a $300M exit as life-
changing, while investors push for a billion-dollar outcome.

  3. **Larger funds can lower returns**

Early-stage funds don’t deploy much into follow-ons at first. But as funds
grow, they allocate more capital to later-stage rounds. This raises their cost
basis and post-money valuation, making it harder to achieve high
multiples—even if they avoid backing total failures.

  4. **"Pile into your winners" works in limited cases**

This strategy makes sense in two situations: when the winners are multi-
billion-dollar companies or when investors double down early before others see
the potential. Outside of these cases, the risk of misjudging and raising the
cost basis can outweigh the reward.

  5. **What top VC firms get right**

The best firms do three things:

  * Focus on backing outliers.

  * Maintain ownership without overpaying.

  * Keep fund size reasonable relative to their stakes.

VC math isn’t complex, but truly understanding how returns work is crucial for
both investors and founders.

While the math may be simple, I think it’s very important for VCs &
entrepreneurs, to understand how returns are calculated.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Many founders believe that a great app idea is enough to make it successful.
But it’s not. What truly matters is the stickiness of your product.

Start thinking about your product in terms of where triggers, constraints, and
user rituals exist within it.

The rise of AI means that more user experiences within the best products will
be trigger-based, rather than static. And wide open experiences will be less
desirable than opinionated, constrained ones.

I love this framework from [Greg Isenberg](https://x.com/gregisenberg). It’s
the new strategy for thinking about how to keep users engaged with your
product.

  1. Trigger action with prompts

  2. Ignite FOMO with constraints

  3. Keep 'em coming back with rituals

If you’re a regular reader of this newsletter, you’ve probably read some of
our articles on [how to determine whether you’ve achieved Product-Market
Fit.](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/how-to-determine-if-you-have-the)

If you look at the timeline below, you’ll see that companies like Notion,
Airtable, and Figma took over three years to hit Product-Market Fit. It takes
years to find Product-Market Fit, so what’s the sign that you should keep
going

**A good first clue is "Promise market fit"…..**

I completely agree with [Dani Grant ](https://x.com/thedanigrant)(CEO, Jam).
However, how to get a clue on “Promise market fit”

> **Promise market fit occurs** when potential users express interest in your
> product's value proposition, even before the product is fully developed or
> launched. The key indicator can be -
>
> **Landing Page Engagement**
>
>   * Users share your landing page, subscribe to updates, or show interest in
> signing up
>
>   * Indicates your value proposition resonates with them
>
>

>
> **Early Sign-Ups and Payments**
>
> **User Feedback and Iteration**
>
> **Referral Activity**
>
> **Social Media Buzz**
>
>   * Positive mentions, shares, and discussions on social media
>
>   * Indicates your product has struck a chord with your target audience
>
>

>
> **Interest from Influencers or Industry Leaders**

While following this indicator, [don’t fall into the trap of fake Product-
Market Fit](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/paul-graham-are-you-
building-fake). These early indicators will help you stay on course and
achieve true Product-Market Fit.

When it comes to the business model, it’s not enough to simply describe your
pricing. To convince investors, your slide must explain the following:

And that’s where things get tricky. Many believe the best course of action is
stripping the business model slide to the bones and avoiding burdening it with
unnecessary metrics and information. The problems begin when some of those
metrics and information you leave out turn out to be pretty darn necessary for
selling your model to investors.  

So here are the 4 mistakes that I see founders make, and ways to fix them:  

1\. **Mistake #1: Treating Your Business Model as a Pricing Slide**  

Instead of just listing pricing tiers, explain the overall mechanics of your
business model, including primary revenue streams (subscriptions, transaction
fees, etc.), and the logic/key drivers behind them.  

2\. **Mistake #2: Having Too Many Revenue Streams**  

Early-stage companies should focus on a maximum of 3 core revenue streams,
with 1-2 being the primary focus. Differentiate between current and future
revenue sources.  

3\. **Mistake #3: Not Showing Your Competitive Advantage**  

Highlight the unique competitive edge or "moat" that makes your business model
sustainable and de-risks it for investors (e.g., low costs, high margins,
effective land and expand motion, scalability).  

4\. **Mistake #4: Not Discussing Business Model Economics**  

Illustrate the attractive aspects of your unit economics to support your
claims, such as low Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), high Customer Lifetime
Value (LTV), favourable LTV: CAC ratio, short payback cycles, and high-profit
margins.  

**Bonus Tip** The Ultimate Business Model Slide Investors love a slide that
concisely presents the key business model drivers, the path to $100M+ revenue,
and verification against the overall market size.  

So, keep your business model slide clean, focus on the primary model and key
revenue streams, and include a few crucial unit economics metrics to justify
your strategy.
