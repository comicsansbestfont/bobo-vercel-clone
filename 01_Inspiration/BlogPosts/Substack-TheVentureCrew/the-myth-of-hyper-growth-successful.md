[In his [](https://longform.asmartbear.com/exponential-
growth/index.html)_[long and
mathematical](https://longform.asmartbear.com/exponential-
growth/index.html)_[] essay](https://longform.asmartbear.com/exponential-
growth/index.html), Jason suggests **an alternate model for how fast-growing
companies** _**actually**_**grow.** I like his thesis, so I’m going to do my
best to synthesize it for you today.

Because, in his own words: **…understanding the model is useful not only for
predicting growth but also because understanding the foundational drivers of
growth allows us to take smarter actions to create growth in our own
companies.**

First, he dispels the notion of “exponential” by looking at some popular
companies that grew rapidly, and who often get dubbed as examples of this
growth model.

Let’s take a look.

It’s been a minute since high school math…

  * **Exponential growth** = growing by a **multiple**. For example: In year 1 you grow by 10, in year 2 by 100, in year 3 by 1000.

  * **Quadratic growth =** growing by adding a **constant**. For example: Growing in year 1 by 10, then in year 2 by 20, in year 3 by 30.

In both, growth is clearly still  _accelerating_ , just at wildly _different_
_rates_. To drive the point home:

**Facebook** is the definition of hyper-growth—getting to $50B in revenue
[faster](http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/how-facebook-became-one-of-the-fastest-
growing-companies-in-u-s-
history-1.1213047?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_medium=post)
than any company in history. The product is “viral”—friends bring other
friends—which theoretically leads to “exponential growth.” But Facebook didn’t
grow exponentially in the number of monthly active users:

Essentially linear for nearly twenty years, only exponential in the first four
years.

> **Slack** was [the fastest-growing enterprise software company
> ever](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2018/11/30/how-slack-became-
> the-fastest-growing-enterprise-software-
> ever?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_medium=post),
> going from $0 to $10M ARR in their first 10 months, and 0 to 10,000,000
> active users in just five years. It’s also a “viral” product—organizations
> invite their members, who then create their own Slack-groups and invite
> others. So surely Slack has exponential growth?
>

>> Slack’s [own data](https://slack.com/blog/news/work-is-fueled-by-true-
engagement?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_medium=post)
shows initial quadratic growth, followed by years of linear growth.

>>

>> _— Jason Cohen_

So, given there’s no proof of an exponential growth model in startups — even
looking at real-world data from the fastest growing companies (he also
investigated HubSpot and Dropbox) — Jason points out that in fact… **hyper-
growth is quadratic.**

It’s not enough to just say that growth in real life is quadratic. We have to
be able to know  _why_ this model makes sense, as this will give us a better
understanding of the growth drivers in our own companies.

Luckily, Jason gives us a **first-principles explanation** so we have that
insight, using the life-cycle of a marketing campaign as an example.

> In my experience, marketing campaigns follow this pattern:
>
> At the foot of the curve, we’ve launched a new campaign, but it’s
> ineffective; we haven’t figured out the best design and messaging and calls-
> to-action for this new medium and audience. Sometimes we never figure it
> out, and abandon the effort.
>
> But in the case that we unlock the secret of efficacy, the campaign rapidly
> reaches a natural level of contribution; in this example, a number of “sales
> per week.” The specific level depends on many things: ad inventory, our
> budget, audience-receptivity, and the consonance between the audience and
> our target market.Next we enter the optimization phase.
>
> We A/B Test our way to incrementally better results. Also we enjoy the

>
> Finally we enter a phase of decline. There are various causes, all

> times than is required to act; it’s now falling on deaf ears. Even if the
> audience is growing, the number of new people is small compared to the
> number of people that were new-to-us when we began the campaign
>
>   * **The channel declines.** A media site that was popular loses readers

He calls this…

Whether it’s a marketing campaign or a new product release, growth initially
accelerates as early issues are solved, then grows roughly linearly as things
are optimized, and then starts dipping over time. That slowdown/decay is
natural as things scale.

But, we don’t do single campaigns or releases, do we…**we add new ones**. Some
end up being bigger than others, some can be better optimized, or decline
sooner, and some decay more steeply than others.

**So, companies that want to continue growing quickly after their first
product reaches scale, must launch new products into new markets.**

This leads to a variety of Elephant Curves across time —which, if plotted
together — look very quadratic.

The consequence of knowing that the growth we encounter at work is quadratic
is important, as we’re all trying to understand (and likely change) growth
drivers. So, “getting the right language, and the right model, will lead to
correct analysis, and right action.”

**And to leave you with something more actionable here:**

  * It’s great to add a feature to an existing product, but significant additional growth comes from increasing carrying capacity or creating a new avenue of growth. Early on you should focus on winning market share in one space, creating the first Elephant Curve, but after the product matures, something more drastic is required: Wholly new products, or updates significant enough to address new markets.

  * It’s well-known that companies need to add additional products to continue fast growth after achieving scale. However, the second product is highly unlikely to achieve the same market share and monetary scale as the first, so there needs to be multiple, not just one. This requires serious investment, parallel efforts, and the chutzpah to kill off the ideas that aren’t working.

  * Because word-of-mouth-driven growth is so much more effective than marketing-driven growth (both in cost-per-customer and in that unlike direct advertising it grows automatically as the company grows), it is worth a great deal of time trying to figure out how to build that into the product, rather than relying only on the marketing team.

##### **FEATURED POST**

Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Justin TV shared " The primary objective
during the initial set of interviews is **not to inquire about optimizing user
flow or delve into specific features details**. Such questions can be
distracting because users often think they know what they want.

This situation can lead to the "**horseless carriage effect,** " where users
request a faster horse instead of seeking a solution to the underlying
problem.

Thus, it is crucial to avoid discussing features as much as possible.. **[Read

##### **TWEET OF THIS WEEK**

Let’s take an example to understand this. Shared by Marc -

“If I had the idea for an app which let me order groceries and have them
delivered, I wouldn't need to test whether people trust me to provide their
credit card (I already know that) or whether the app can accurately determine
where I am (I already know that) or whether I can have a directory of every
possible grocery store and their inventory (I know that is possible too).

No, I'm curious whether customers care. How frequently they use it. What
prices they would pay? So I could hack that together using a no-code front end
and see what happens."
