RYSE is poised to dominate the smart shades market (currently growing at 50%

##### **TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

Most people have no idea what VCs look for….

When it comes to fundraising, founders often follow a well-trodden path -
building a pitch deck, cold-emailing investors, or reaching out to them
through LinkedIn. However, without the right strategy, these tactics are
unlikely to yield the desired results. To develop an effective strategy, it's
crucial to understand the key factors that compel venture capitalists (VCs) to
invest in a startup.

Through my work with VC firms and conversations with successful founders who
have raised money from leading VCs, I've found 12 key things that can help you
get VC funding:

  1. **The Right Fit**

Successful VC fundraising starts with identifying the **right fit**. VCs often
"advertise" the types of startups they're interested in through various
channels like social media, podcasts, and newsletters. As a founder, pay
attention to these signals - they indicate the areas VCs want to fund. By
reaching out to investors already excited about your space, you can save
valuable time and increase your chances of securing investment.

  2. **A Growing Market**

Some markets are growing faster than others.

A VC's job is to pick which ones will vs won’t. This is why AI is attracting
so much capital right now. Founders should make it clear that they're early to
a market that will be big.

  3. **A Big Vision**

VCs understand that the startup landscape is highly competitive, with the vast
majority of new ventures ultimately failing. However, they also know that a
small percentage of startups have the potential to deliver outsized returns -
as much as 1000x their initial investment.

When seeking VC funding, founders should not focus on pitching a "safe bet."
Instead, the goal should be to sell VCs on a big vision - an opportunity that
has the potential to disrupt the market and generate massive growth.

  4. **A Unique Insight:**

VCs are on the lookout for "asymmetric bets" - investments with outsized
potential. To capture their attention, founders need to demonstrate a **unique
insight** that sets their startup apart.

VCs want to see founders who are "zigging" while the market is "zagging" -
communicating an understanding of something not widely recognized. By
showcasing this distinctive perspective, you can position your startup as a
compelling, differentiated opportunity worthy of investment.

  5. **The Right Timing**

VCs closely monitor market trends to assess the **right timing** for a
startup's product. Being too early can be as problematic as being too late, as
seen with Webvan versus Instacart. As a founder, you must ensure you're
addressing trends that VCs are currently excited about.

Aligning your startup's offering with the right market conditions and consumer
demand can demonstrate you've identified the optimal window, capturing
investor attention and increasing your funding prospects.

  6. **A Clear Message**

VCs see a ton of pitches and decks.

Communicate concisely to stand out. Founders should practice how they talk
about their startups over and over.

  7. **A Scalable Way To Grow**

A great product is essential, but VCs know that sustainable **scalable
growth** is key. While "non-scalable" tactics may work early on, founders must
eventually find distribution channels that can support large-scale expansion.
When pitching to VCs, demonstrate a relentless focus on identifying cost-
effective growth avenues that can acquire customers at volume for
significantly less than their projected lifetime value (LTV).

  8. **A Strong Moat:**

VCs want to see that your startup has a **strong moat** \- factors that will
retain users long-term and make it hard for competitors to replicate.

Demonstrate your product is so compelling users won't want to leave, perhaps
by highlighting unique features, IP, or powerful network effects. Convincing
VCs your business has sustainable competitive advantages is key to earning
their investment. But nowadays most founders are [afraid to talk about
MOAT](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/why-founders-are-afraid-to-talk-
about-ea0)….

  9. **Early Traction**

VCs look for early **traction** as a signal that startups are solving a real
problem. This can be evidenced through strong usage metrics or enthusiastic
customer testimonials. The ideal scenario is when 40% or more of your users
would be "very disappointed" if your product no longer existed.

As a founder, your focus should be on building something people genuinely
want, as this early traction can help convince investors of your startup's
viability and growth potential.

  10. **A Good Reputation**

VCs will call your former co-workers to learn about you.

Positive references go a long way to helping close the deal. This signals a
founder won't have trouble hiring and retaining good people. Founders should
be sure they have good relationships with others.

  11. **Relevant Experience**

In the early stages, **founder-market fit** is often more important than
product-market fit. Relevant experience allows founders to move with greater
**speed** \- the top advantage startups have.

By solving problems they deeply understand, founders can leverage their
expertise to navigate challenges more effectively.

VCs recognize that this relevant experience can be a significant competitive
edge, as it enables startups to iterate and execute more efficiently than
their less experienced counterparts.

  12. **Passion for the problem**

VCs know startups are gruelling and have seen many founders burn out. To stand
out, founders must demonstrate a deep **passion for the problem** they're
solving. This unwavering commitment signals the resilience needed to overcome
challenges, convincing VCs to back their vision.

**So overall - Why VCs write a check:**

  1. The right fit 

  2. A big vision 

  3. A growing market 

  4. A unique insight 

  5. Good timing 

  6. A clear message 

  7. A scalable way to grow 

  8. A strong moat 

  9. Early traction 

  10. A good reputation 

  11. Relevant experience 

  12. Passion for the problem

##### **QUICK DIVES**

Every founder thinks they have an awesome team and technology; the question
is, what will investors think?

In fundraising, most founders are tempted to jump straight into PowerPoint to
get started.

Don’t do it! Here’s the secret to a great pitch: "It’s not about the slides;
it’s about the story."

So how do you tell a compelling story? - First, figure out which type of story
you should be telling and make that narrative into a sandwich, emphasizing the
key point at the beginning and again at the end.

Next, use your problem and solution statements to emotionally and
intellectually engage your audience, and be sure to adequately address all the
expected areas in the deck.

With all that in mind, you’ll be ready to follow three simple steps to craft
your winning deck. Choose The Right Story To Tell.…

Most ideas, especially in B2C, get validated in one of four ways:

  1. Signal Aggregation → Conduct experiments to gather data before launching (landing page tests, etc).

  2. Strong Beta → Run a small-scale beta and hit established benchmarks that are good for your vertical

  3. True Fans → Find people who will be very disappointed if your product goes away.

  4. Visionary → The least common. You have a vision for something, build it, and it ends up working out. Typically includes some combination of the other.

**[This framework](https://www.consumerstartups.com/p/idea-validation-
framework-backed)** defines the differences between each path to validation..

Ryan Hoover, founder of Product Hunt shared[ a tweet
](https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1775943063522734387/photo/1)on why
investors backed this hot consumer AI startup.

A startup’s potential scale is bound by its future market size, and
consequently “What is your market size?” is one of the determining questions
that most VCs ask early-stage entrepreneurs.

  * Why does market size matter?

  * How to estimate your market size?

  * What is the exact definition of market size?

  * When should market size be estimated?

Remember - an entrepreneur’s clarity of thought and enduring ambition as more
important than the market size number in a pitch deck. The objective of market
sizing is to show that you are targeting a big market opportunity that you
understand deeply.

Startups have many unknowns and market sizing is a rough estimation, so keep
it simple.

_Based on a peer VC survey,_ “it seems that many investors do not like to
define TAM/SAM/SOM terms.” So when presenting your market sizing, explicitly
state your methodology rather than assume universal definitions..…
