##### **📜 DEEP DIVE**

Building a pitch deck for your seed round is a crucial step in your startup
journey. It’s not just about putting slides together—it’s about crafting a
story that resonates with investors and gets them genuinely excited about your
vision.

While there are plenty of guides online about building pitch decks, most of
them fall short of offering clear, actionable advice. That’s why I’ve taken
the time to dive deep into Y Combinator’s resources, watch hours of their
videos, and analyze detailed articles to create this comprehensive and
practical guide for you.

Your pitch deck should achieve two things:

For seed-stage startups, this often means focusing on simplicity and narrative
clarity. Remember, at this stage, most startups don’t have extensive data or
years of history to share—and that’s perfectly fine. Your goal is to make your
story as compelling and concise as possible.

Creating a pitch deck doesn’t have to be overly complicated. It’s all about
telling a clear, concise, and compelling story that investors can follow
easily. Here’s how you can structure your deck:

**Title Slide**

Start strong with a title slide that sets the tone for your pitch. It should
include:

Keep it simple and professional. This is your first impression, so make it
count.

This is where you lay out the real-world issue your startup is solving. A
well-defined problem statement is crucial for connecting with your audience.

  * Focus on the impact of the problem on real people or businesses.

  * Use a statistic, example, or story to make it relatable.

Avoid overloading this slide with too much text or technical jargon. The
problem should be clear and easy to understand.

Next, explain how your product or service solves the problem you’ve just
described. This is your chance to show why your approach is unique and
valuable.

  * Keep your explanation brief and to the point.

  * Highlight the concrete benefits of your solution.

  * If needed, use visuals or diagrams, but avoid cluttering the slide.

Investors love to see traction—it’s proof that your startup is making
progress. Even if your numbers are early, show them off in a way that’s easy
to understand.

  * Use a chart or graph to showcase key metrics like revenue or user growth.

  * Add context to explain why these metrics are important.

  * Keep it honest and straightforward. Smooth growth curves are rare, and that’s okay.

What makes your startup special? Use this slide to highlight what sets you
apart from competitors.

  * Focus on your unique insights, technology, or approach.

  * Keep it concise and avoid unnecessary technical details.

Your business model is all about showing how you make money. While it doesn’t
have to be perfect, it should be clear enough for investors to understand.

  * Explain your revenue streams and pricing strategy.

  * If you have any early results, include them here.

  * Break complex models into simpler components if needed.

Investors need to see the potential for scale. Use this slide to showcase the
size of your market and the opportunity you’re addressing.

  * Provide a high-level overview of your Total Addressable Market (TAM).

  * Use a clean, visual representation to convey scale.

A compelling market opportunity slide gives investors confidence in your
startup’s long-term potential.

Your team is one of the most critical factors for early-stage investors. Use
this slide to show why your team is uniquely qualified to solve the problem.

Wrap up your pitch with a clear “ask.” Be specific about what you need and
what investors can expect in return.

  * State the amount you’re raising.

  * Explain how the funds will be used (e.g., product development, hiring, marketing).

  * Outline where you expect to be within a year and how this funding helps you get there.

Remember — even the best content can fall flat if your slides aren’t designed
effectively. You might be wondering how startups that raised millions of
dollars build and design their pitch decks.

That’s why we’ve curated 40+ real slides from startups that secured funding
from Y Combinator and leading VCs. Here are a few examples:

  * **Maikbou** – Raised $3.3M (Seed round)

  * **Pathrise** – Raised $3M (Seed round)

  * **Lago** – Raised $22M (Seed round)

  * **Apriora** – Raised $2.8M (Seed round)

  * **Careerist** – Raised $8M (Series A)

  * **Vori** – Raised $45M (Series A)

  * **Rippling** – Raised $145M (Series B)

  * **Thunkable** – Raised $30M (Series B)

  * **Pelago** – Raised $58M (Series C)
