Have you ever thought about how the LPs evaluate the performance of venture
capital? As you guys may be aware of the [fund cycle of vc
firm](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/venture-capital-fund-modelling-
iii), venture capital generally raised the capital from Limited Partners (LPs)
to deploy into the startups. Even for the VC professional it really important
to keep track of these terms which give an idea about the performance of their
overall investment.

Enter the holy trinity of venture capital fund evaluation: Distribution Paid
in Capital, Residual Value Paid in Capital, and Total Value Paid in Capital.
These three terms hold the key to unlocking the true performance of a fund and
give LPs invaluable insights into its success.

There are generally **three terms that are used to evaluate the performance of
a VC fund:**

  1. **Distribution Paid In Capital (DPI)**

  2. **Residual Value Paid In Capital (RVPI)**

  3. **Total Value Paid In Capital (TVPI)**

Let’s take an **example** and try to understand each term:

Suppose Limited Partners (LP) **committed to invest around $5M in a VC fund**
and General Partners (GP/VC) ask for an amount of $4M for 3 years out of $5M.
So here Paid in Capital (PIC) = $4M.

_[ Remember: the Paid In Capital is different from the Committed Capital. The
Committed capital is the amount of money that an investor agrees to contribute
to the investment fund. here Committed capital is $5M and Paid Capital is $4M
(previously mentioned). ]_

So what’s the Distribution Paid in Capital (DPI) and Residual Value Paid in
Capital (RVPI) in this example?

  * **Distribution Paid In Capital (DPI):** It is the amount of money that the VC fund has returned to the Limited Partners, which is low in the early year and increases over the period.

  * **Residual Value Paid In Capital (RVPI):** It is the amount of money that remained after the distribution or returned to the Limited Partners.

Ex - Suppose VC Fund has decided to invest in 20 startups and out of that, VC
funds have exited from 5 startups and that money is returned to the investors
and now the remaining investment is 15 startups. So if the 15 investment value
is $150M and cash is around $10M. So the Residual Value of the Fund is $150M +
$10M = $160M.

  * **Total Value Paid In Capital (TVPI**) = DPI + RVPI

Now, let’s understand all terms with one example of VC fund

**Ex** : Fund’s Paid In Capital (PIC) = $70M

Distribution Capital (D) = $80M and Residual Capital (R) = $100M (Hope you are
getting the idea of what these terms from the above explanation)

**Calculation:**

  * Distribution Paid In Capital (DPI) = D / PIC = 80 / 70 = 1.1420X

  * Residual Value Paid In Capital (RVPI) = R / PIC = 100 / 70 = 1.428X

  * Total Value Paid In Capital (TVPI) = DPI + RVPI = 1.1420 + 1.4280 = 2.57X

**Explanation** :

  * DPI = 1.1420X i.e. Fund has returned to LPs all paid-in capital i.e. $70M and received 14.28 above that original amount paid.

  * RVPI = Still a lot of value of funds left behind, which will return to LPs in the coming time.

  * TVPI = Total value of fund utilized.

This means the fund is able to generate more return over the original amount
i.e. paid-in capital. You can try out this example to calculate in Excel.

That’s it. I hope it will help you to understand these terms.
