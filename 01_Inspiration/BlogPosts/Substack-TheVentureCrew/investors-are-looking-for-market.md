##### **FROM OUR PARTNER**

Data Engineering is no longer just a backstage player but is taking centre
stage in the VC space.

It is about constructing and maintaining the architectures (think databases,
large-scale processing systems) that allow for data availability—a cornerstone
for insightful analysis and well-informed decisions.  

**Turning raw data into usable outputs and insights** has great use cases for
deal sourcing, due diligence, or portfolio monitoring.

##### **TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

**Every pitch deck** needs to have a “Market” slide. Unfortunately, most
entrepreneurs get the market slide wrong.

That’s not necessarily their fault. **The fault lies in the pitch coaching
industry** that insists that every deck include a slide with TAM, SAM and SOM.
(total addressable market, serviceable addressable market, serviceable
obtainable market or variations on these terms.)

You can find templates for this slide all over the internet.

**Almost always, the template has three bubbles:**

> Sometimes they appear side by side, like the porridge bowls of the three
> bears, and sometimes they are elegantly nested within one another, like a
> matryoshka doll.

Three Bubbles Slide (Google Images)

It’s amazing how this three-bubble market size slide has spread. It seems that
everywhere I go on the planet, from Stockholm to Shenzhen, entrepreneurs are
using a similar slide.

**Typically, entrepreneurs claim,**

> “Our global TAM is $X billion, but we are going to start out in a certain
> part of the world, where our SAM is $Y billion. And we conservatively
> project that our SOM is $Z billion.”

At times, they also show a very precise compound annual growth rate (“with a
CAGR of 17.65%”) to demonstrate their analytical rigour.

It’s clear **why entrepreneurs try to pump up their market size**.

“They’ve been told that venture capital investors are only interested in
unicorns, and so they assume that the best way to become a unicorn is to go
after the largest market possible.”

**Presumably, the thinking is** that it is easier to get 2% of a very large
market than it is to get 20% of a smaller market. So, they earnestly search
for market data that allow them to claim that their TAM is perhaps $56
billion, or $256 billion, or even better, $2.5 trillion.

When this slide appears, most investors chuckle (or weep). Not only are the
numbers always exaggerated, they are also irrelevant.

Investors generally don’t give any credence to the market size numbers that
founders present to them.

**We may still ask founders how big their target market** is, but the point of
the question is to see how founders think about market segmentation, not to
rate the startup based on how big they think the market is.

`Savvy investors may prefer that startups go after a market that does not yet
exist. Better to create the market than try to unseat established
competitors.`

Rather than claiming that you can disrupt a huge existing market, what’s more,
relevant and compelling is how you answer questions such as:

  * Who are your target customers?

  * How will you reach them?

  * How many can you reach?

  * How will you convert them?

  * How many can you convert?

  * How will you onboard them?

  * How much will that cost?

  * What is a customer worth?

  * How many customers will you acquire this year? Next year? The year after?

> Most investors want to see market _opportunity_ , not market _size_.

They need to see that you understand who you are going after at the individual
customer level, why the customers will love your solution, how you are going
to reach target customers and how many customers are likely to convert.

**Founders should build a bottom-up model** that demonstrates how you will
build a big, profitable business, customer by customer. If you are truly
innovating, you are creating a new market. Show investors how you are going to
build an ever-expanding cadre of delighted customers. Don’t suggest that your
focus is on acquiring market share in a large established market.

The typical market size slide is obsolete.

We’ve heard several teams pitch wearable technologies for dogs to track their
activity. It’s easy for startups to claim that the TAM for such a product is
in the billions. They might state that there are 90 million dogs in the United
States alone — at a $9.95 a month subscription, that’s a $10 billion market!

In fact, for the dog wearables business, it doesn’t matter if there are only
20 million dogs or 200 million dogs. What matters is how many dog owners the
entrepreneur can convince, one by one, to sign up for this service. That
requires defining and understanding the target customers in granular detail.
Not “dog owners,” but “urban professionals, aged 25 to 35, earning over
$80,000 per year and frequently posting on Instagram who own dogs.” Or
something similarly precise, showing that you’ve done your homework.

**Entrepreneurs should stop pitching the typical market-size slide**.
**Instead -**

They should show investors that they truly understand the _market opportunity_
from the bottom up, customer by customer. Offering a compelling value
proposition with their product or service and delighting customers is how they
will ultimately succeed.
