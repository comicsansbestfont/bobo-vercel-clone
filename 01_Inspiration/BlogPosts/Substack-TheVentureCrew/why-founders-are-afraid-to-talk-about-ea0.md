> **“Generational companies are not built on the latest technologies but in
> bold statements.”**

You might wonder what it means - does it relate to MOAT? By the end of this
writeup - you will get the real meaning of these bold statements. You will get
an idea of how startups like Stripe/Airbnb/Spotify are perfectly aligned
(their MOAT) with this statement….

“MOAT” - seems like a new word; in recent times, founders are afraid to talk
about the MOAT of their startup.  

They don’t want to recall as most startups or so-called AI startups don’t have
a MOAT except those 2-3, you know who I am talking about. Let’s not recall
those names but let’s rewind the time when founders/investors used to talk
about MOAT. Most of the founders were afraid because they didn’t understand
the real meaning of MOAT!!

Just remember it’s not any tech, AI-powered, some API or other things….. So

**What’s The Moat For A Startup?**

> Moats are a set of characteristics (competitive advantages) a company has
> that make it hard for other companies to compete.

In practical terms, I think about this by answering the question, **what can’t
a company with $1B sitting in the bank just buy?  
**  
The answer? Many things: Community, Trust, Network Effects, Users, etc.

In the past, **tech was considered a strong moat** since it required large
amounts of capital to be built. But the truth is, the level of defensibility
provided by tech to startups is at an all-time low and decreasing faster than
ever before. Defensibility at a product level is incredibly hard to achieve,
let alone sustain.

**Features aren’t moats because they can be replicated.** And now, as AI
starts to spill into software development, software’s marginal cost will
dramatically decrease in the upcoming years.  

`With AI Tech will become an even weaker moat. Code will start to become a
commodity.`

**What’s Your Moat?**

_P.S.: The above Image is Just for fun! But Is this true?_

> One of the most common questions that every founder receives while pitching
> investors (or founders in general) is ‘What’s your moat?’.

Most of the tech founders try to find a convincing way to explain why the tech
they are building is unbeatable, or why the features that they planned to
launch are game changers. But none of this matters.

**If you want to convince investors on MOAT of your startup.** Just ask one
question to yourself.

`‘Why am I being asked this? What was Airbnb, Spotify, or any other successful
company’s moat when they just were getting started? In their origins, what did
they have that nobody else had?’`

It is just one thing. “`A bold statement on how the world should look like.”`

> **“Generational companies are not built on the latest technologies but in
> bold statements.”**

When these are being built, tech only plays a fraction in innovation. The
engine that facilitates the creation of new companies **is dreaming of better
experiences.**

**Spotify’s moat**

For many years the only option for streaming and downloading music was
pirating (usually off Piratebay). People got used to scrolling through music
pirating websites and were OK with clicking through spam and fake download
buttons to get a new music album. It wasn’t a state-of-the-art experience, but
it worked. If you wanted to hear a song, you could. As mentioned in the
episode featuring **[Daniel Ek](https://twitter.com/eldsjal)** , founder of
Spotify, in **[Reid Hoffman](https://twitter.com/reidhoffman)** ’s podcast
Masters Of Scale, before the foundation of Spotify, ‘ _music lovers**already**
**had** the world music at their fingerprints._’

Although seen as a technological breakthrough, Spotify was more of a powerful
statement and an unparalleled experience. At the time, it wasn’t built with
mind-boggling software. As far as tech goes, Spotify could have been created
five years earlier. Spotify was a bold statement and a big bet. People weren’t
unhappy with how they were listening to music. They **were** happy. **No one
imagined it could get better until someone did.** People weren’t pirating
music because it was free. It wasn’t an economic hurdle. It was instead a
convenience one.

Daniel Ek did something genuinely bold. Although nobody was complaining about
the current state of music, he dared to imagine an even better experience.
Building a company in an industry where the vast majority is happy with what
they currently have, requires an astonishing vision, and blinding
determination**.**

`And that was Daniel’s moat. Unlike tech, a vision (the act or power of
imagination) or a statement cannot be bought.`

Most of the founders don’t find a bold statement for their startup and fail to
create a MOAT for their startup!!!

There is also one thing -

**Should entrepreneurs always look to solve ‘problems’?**

At that time, Spotify was not solving a true, existing problem. It made the
experience 100 better, at least. But back then, nobody would have defined
listening to music as a ‘problem.’

This is why, in my opinion, one of the most common tips for founders, ‘Talk to
users’, should be taken with a grain of salt. Yes, talking to users can help
identify customers’ pain points that may otherwise go unnoticed and provide
valuable feedback on a product or idea. However, if founders delegate their
entire creative process to potential customers, they automatically set a
ceiling on what can be built based on users’ wants. And the truth is, people
don’t know what they want until they see it.

**There are millions of bold statements waiting to be realized.** It just
takes a brave mind to effectively see around themselves in non-obvious places
where things can get 100X better.

Recently Reid Hoffman (Co-founder of LinkedIn & ) shared an interesting
perspective on Whether founders should work by Vision or Data -

“It's about constantly balancing and integrating your vision with the data you
collect. Why? ”….**[Read More
