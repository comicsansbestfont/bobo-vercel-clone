##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

If you’re a B2B SaaS founder and not leveraging Reddit, you’re leaving leads
on the table.

I recently came across reddit marketing guide by [Adam
Shaw](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-shaw-stl/) so thought to share with you
some key points and my opinion with you. He shared - “Reddit is the #2 source
of leads, right after LinkedIn. It’s where people are actively asking for help
and exploring new solutions—unlike LinkedIn, which is more about storytelling
and sharing success.

And here’s the kicker: 50% of my leads come from just answering questions on
Reddit for less than an hour a day.**”**

Here’s how you can do it

**Step 1: Turn Your Profile into a Landing Page**

Your Reddit profile is like a mini landing page. It’s the first place curious
users will go after reading your comments or posts. Make sure it’s optimized
to convert.

**How to set it up:**

  * Choose a username that’s tied to your brand or product.

  * Write an actionable profile name (e.g., “Helping SaaS Founders Scale”).

  * Add a CTA to your profile banner (e.g., “Download our Free SaaS Marketing Guide”).

  * Include your one-line product pitch and CTA in the bio (e.g., “We help SaaS founders grow faster. Subscribe to our newsletter below!”).

  * Add links to key resources like:

    * Lead magnets

    * Newsletter sign-ups

    * Product demo

**Step 2: Find Subreddits Where Your Audience Hangs Out**

Reddit is vast, but your audience is likely concentrated in a handful of niche
subreddits.

**How to find them:**

  1. Use Reddit’s search bar to look for your product keywords (e.g., “SaaS,” “startup growth,” etc.).

  2. Use Google to search for “your keywords + Reddit” (pro tip: Google is better at finding Reddit threads than Reddit itself).

  3. Pick subreddits with active, engaged members in your niche.

**Pro tip:** Use tools like [Gummy
Search](https://gummysearch.com/?via=fdaae0) to automate finding relevant
subreddits and posts.

**Step 3: Prepare a Lead Magnet**

Redditors hate being sold to. They love **value first** approaches.

That’s where a lead magnet comes in. It’s a way to engage your audience
without coming across as too salesy.'

**Examples of great lead magnets:**

  * In-depth guides tailored to specific problems.

  * Free trials of your product.

  * Newsletters with actionable advice (my favorite).

Make it easy for people to commit. For example, I use a newsletter landing
page to capture leads. By the time they get there, I’ve already built trust
through helpful comments.

**Step 4: Start by Commenting, Not Posting**

Engage first, post later.

**Why?** Comments are more personal and allow you to directly connect with
people asking for help. You’ll also learn what your audience really needs.

**How to comment like a pro:**

  * Answer recent posts (24-48 hours old) for better visibility.

  * Avoid crowded posts (0-10 comments is the sweet spot).

  * Add value. Most comments are generic—stand out by being actionable, specific, and helpful.

**Step 5: Be the Best Commenter**

The secret to success on Reddit? Write better comments than everyone else.

**Here’s how:**

  * Be highly relevant—answer only what’s asked.

  * Be specific—don’t just say “try this.” Explain _how_ to try it.

  * Go in-depth—assume the person has zero knowledge.

  * Stay friendly—ignore trolls.

**Make your comment stand out visually too:**

  * Use white space for readability.

  * Add bullet points to organize your thoughts.

  * Be longer than most comments (Reddit loves thoughtful responses).

**Step 6: Post to Curate Conversations**

Once you’ve spent a few weeks commenting, you’ll notice patterns in what your
audience talks about. That’s when you start posting.

But don’t make the mistake of being self-serving. Redditors can smell that a
mile away.

**Here’s what works:**

  * Don’t post a blog or self-promo content. Instead, ask questions that spark engagement.

  * Let the audience share their thoughts and experiences in the comments.

  * Use their responses to build conversations and authority naturally.

Reddit can be a goldmine for B2B SaaS founders if used the right way. Focus on
engagement first, provide value, and let the leads come to you.

Recently, Brett Adcock, the founder of Figure Robot, shared a tweet in which
he listed several reasons **why he believes cold emails work better than
referrals.**

  1. Outbound cold email scales several orders of magnitude better than referrals - you can find 99.9% of anybody’s email.

Raising capital is a shots-on-goal game; you want to maximize top-of-funnel
pitches. Optimizing your fundraising for referrals will put you at a local
maximum.

  2. It’s a challenge finding somebody who will stick their neck out to refer you. People rarely want to use their political capital referring you to a *highly important person* in their network, therefore at best you’re left with lousy double opt-in email.

Although I completely agree with these points, many founders struggle with
writing cold emails to investors. Some founders even question whether
investors open cold emails. Here's what investors said:

  * [Keith Rabois ](https://x.com/rabois)prefers a deck, and he reads most of them.

  * [Aileen Lee](https://x.com/aileenlee) or her partners read every email pitch that comes into Cowboy Ventures.

  * [David Sacks ](https://x.com/DavidSacks)of Craft prefers a short email pitch that summarizes the opportunity.

  * [Satya Patel](https://x.com/satyap) of Homebrew reads everything sent to him

Jason (Founder of SaaStrfund) said - “I do get behind on email, but I love an
amazing cold email and have funded maybe ~50% of my investments from them. I
like an email pitch that is so amazing that I’d fund it just based on the
email alone. “

So yes, is a perfect warm intro better? Yes. But even the top, most famous
Seed VCs are hunting. Hunting unicorns and decacorns. And they can’t wait for
them all to come from their networks.

Here’s the email from two startups to which [Jason](https://x.com/jasonlk)
gave million-dollar funding…

> So put together the very, very best cold email you can. Make it awesome in
> every way. And send it to your top VCs. At least seed and probably Series A
> VCs, too.

They may not respond. But if it’s awesome, including the title, I bet they
open it. And if it’s super awesome, you have a better chance than you might
think of getting a meeting.

Chris posted **[this
framework](https://x.com/frantzfries/status/1488195684121530370)** in January
of 2022.

Since then, he’s founded a [YC-backed startup](https://loops.so/) that makes
it incredibly simple and easy to send transactional emails and sequences for
any company, with a revenue growth chart that looks like this:

Here’s the framework:

  1. Pick a customer you enjoy talking to

  2. Talk to 15 of them to be sure you do (and can get in touch with them)

  3. Ask them to tell you a problem that’s more important than an 8 on a scale of 1-10

  4. If that problem is generalizable, make the smallest MVP you can (no code required, if possible)

  5. Ask the 15 people if they’d pay for what you built, or would pay if you prioritized a certain feature they ask for

  6. Repeat, with 50 new people. If the feature requests you’re getting are too varied, you may be solving the wrong problem.

Super practical and simple, but true! If you can’t find people to pay for your
product, you likely don’t have a product that can turn into a business. Click

##### **🗞️ THIS WEEK’S NEWS RECAP**

  * OpenAI's Stargate project, backed by SoftBank and MGX, aims to invest $100B–$500B in U.S. data centers but has [yet to secure](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/24/openais-stargate-project-reportedly-doesnt-have-the-money-it-needs/)**[](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/24/openais-stargate-project-reportedly-doesnt-have-the-money-it-needs/)** full funding or a comprehensive plan.
