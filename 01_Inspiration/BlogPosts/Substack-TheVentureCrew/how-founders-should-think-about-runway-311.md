##### **📜 DEEP DIVE**

Founders often view runway as just a number or equation, but VCs expect them
to think beyond that. Sequoia Capital shared a framework on how founders
should approach the runway. In this write-up, we will discuss...

  * Runway Reality

  * What is your runway right now? How should you calculate it?

  * How should you think about how much runway you need?

  * How do you extend your runway if you need more?

Let’s deep dive into this….

**The basics: What is a runway?**

> It’s your cash balance divided by your monthly burn.

If you have $10M in cash and $0.5M in burn, you have 20 months of runway

But it gets a little more nuanced than that. **The cleanest way to look at
your cash balance is net cash,** which is the cash you have on your balance
sheet minus any debt you’ve drawn.

> If you have $10M in cash but you’ve drawn $5M in venture debt, you really
> have $5M of net cash and you should use that number to think about your
> runway.

But why? The reason is that debt is borrowed money. It’s not yours. You owe it
to a creditor. Similar to how you make personal budget decisions based on your
assets minus whatever debt you owe, you should think about your company’s cash
position the same way.

The TLDR is that having a line is a helpful lifeline when you’re facing a cash
crunch, but drawing it comes at a cost. It makes it harder to raise your next
round. It comes with covenants which means debt holders can own more and more
of your company. It can be a negative signal, and it can generate a lot of
overhangs.

That said, one of our recommendations, if you are tight on cash, is to secure
a venture debt line and just not to consider it part of your runway. Ideally,
you don’t draw on it unless absolutely necessary, with eyes wide open to the
tradeoffs

**Monthly burn—this is different from your net income.**

Net income is an accounting concept. Burn is cash in minus cash out.

It takes into account things that aren’t in your monthly P&L: for example, if
you have to buy inventory upfront, or if you have capex outlays upfront, or
for a subscription company if you collect upfront on yearly contracts—all of
these things impact your cash burn. It’s critical to have a very tight grip on
what your cash burn is. There may be ways to reduce the gap between EBIT and
free cash flow—maybe that means paying your suppliers a little later or
collecting revenue earlier.

If you have a lumpy business, meaning you have to provide cash upfront to
build out capital expenditures or you’re purchasing inventory, it’s
existentially important to have a very detailed understanding of your expected
cash outlays. If you’re not careful in managing and forecasting these outlier
expenses, then your runway can turn out to be 3 months when you thought it was
15.

> **One more thing: Runway is not static.**
>
> Just because you have 8 years of runway doesn’t mean you can forget about it
> and assume you’re fine. As your revenue and expense base change, your runway
> can change very quickly. You want to stay focused on the burn number. You
> should be calculating your runway every single month and watching that
> number religiously.

**A Mental Framework For Founders - Runway and Milestone**

If you are reading this newsletter, previously I have mentioned “You are
raising fund not to increase your runway, but to achieve your milestone”

**As a founder, how should you look at this graph?** Suppose you and your CFO
put your heads together, and your best guess for how cash changes over time
looks something like this chart.

This is your cash-out point. 12 months before that, it’s time to think about
raising again.

**Runway doesn’t come in a vacuum. It’s intimately tied to meeting valuation
milestones.**

Green - Milestones & Black - Runway

Imagine you’re driving your car on the freeway and running out of gas. What
matters is not how many gallons of gas you have in your car, but whether it’s
going to last you until you reach the next gas station. Think about what your
goal is for your next fundraising. Maybe it’s an up round. Maybe it’s a flat
round. Maybe it’s a down round. Maybe it’s to reach a cash flow positive.

Whatever your goal is, which is a conversation between the leadership team and
the board, there is some valuation milestone attached to achieving that goal.
Figure out what metrics or “fundamentals” get you to your goal. Maybe it’s
ARR. Maybe it’s Gross Profit. This is the green line on this chart.

**The rough mental framework is** that well before you run out of cash, you
need to make sure you have the fundamentals in order to meet your next
valuation milestone.

> These two lines are intertwined (Previous image). There’s a delicate balance
> in your scenario analysis between investing in growth and burning cash in
> order to make sure that you are leaving enough runway to meet the next
> milestone. It’s important to hope for the best but plan for the worst as you
> are plotting out how to make the math work.

**Raising your next round on pure story is not enough anymore.**

That worked when the capital was plenty, but investors are now going to care
about your metrics, and more importantly your financials. So it’s important to
make sure that you are focused on **getting that valuation milestone to the
right place.**

Now, you’ve done the exercise of figuring out your runway versus your metrics
and valuation fundamentals. There are three possible scenarios for your runway
situation:

  1. Bucket 1: <12 months of runway, when it is existential to focus on your runway

  2. Bucket 2: 12 months of the runway but not enough to raise a flat round based on rational metrics: Here it’s critically important to focus on the runway.

  3. Bucket 3: Enough runway to raise a flat round, up round or reach cash flow positive: Stay the course and continuously optimize.

Some founders are in Bucket 1. A few are in Bucket 3. But many are in Bucket
2. If we can emphasize one point in this writeup it’s this: many founders may
think they’re in Bucket 3 but are actually in Bucket 2.

The financials that you have to reach to cover your next round have changed.
The bar has been raised. Many of us are 3-4 years away from reaching our last
valuation, with less than that amount of cash. In that case, it’s critically
important to focus on managing the runway, even if you have years of runway
remaining.

**So - how to extend your runway?**

If you take us at our word that all probably need more runway than thought,
the question is: How do you get it?

Like many things in business, it’s very easy to say and it’s very hard to do.

**The first step in getting very tactical is to understand your current
state.**

This means looking deeply into your P&L. If you’re talking about runway, that
means you’re losing money every month. So you have to figure out where the net
loss comes from. Once you’ve identified the specific places in your P&L
causing your burn, you can start thinking about which dollars yield efficient
growth and which are not as helpful

**To understand which parts of your P &L need to be addressed**, **begin with
the big picture and break it down into parts.** Starting with net loss, you
can break that into two parts: gross margin and opex.

Then break each of those down into component parts: ○ What are all the drivers
of your gross margin? What is the cost of sales, etc? ○ What are all the
drivers of compensation opex and non-compensation opex? How much of the opex
is dedicated to computer hardware, hosting and subscriptions, etc? ● Keep
breaking it down until you have a detailed view of the components that
contribute to total net loss.

Once you’ve identified the important contributions to your burn, **you can
plot them in terms of their burn impact on the y-axis.** Then there’s the ease
of execution:

how easy is it to address and how big an impact does it have? Unfortunately,
you’re not likely to find many items that are high-impact and easy to execute.
Changes that extend your runway a lot will almost certainly be difficult. This
plot is important because it will set your roadmap for the actions you take to
extend your runway

Once you understand the levers available to impact the runway, **you can use
them to set a goal.** Your goal should be oriented around how long it’s going
to take for you to reach a rational milestone. Let’s say your goal is a flat
round. Given the market conditions, for many of us that’s going to take us
three years.

To unpack why that is:

  * Say you hypothetically raised your last round at a billion dollars, and you have five to 10 million of ARR.

  * if you want to raise your next round at a billion dollars, you might need 75 to 100 million of ARR, which might mean you need to grow about 10 to 15X.

  * It takes time to do that. It very well might take three or four years

If it takes three years, recommend **you have four years of runway.** The
reason: as mentioned earlier, you want to raise 12 months before running out
of money. Generally, investors view it as a bad sign to have a very short
runway, so you want to avoid being in this situation when raising a round. So
the time you need to hit your goal plus 12 months is the ideal runway that
would suggest.

One recommendation: When you decide how long it will take to reach your goal,
be very realistic. Use public comps and ask the toughest board member. Ask her
what it will take to reach a flat round based on rational milestones, and then
add 12 months.

So now you’ve taken the steps to understand where you are, and you’ve broken
down your P&L to understand where the money goes. You’ve plotted your options
in terms of ease-to-execute versus burn impact. And you’ve set a goal based on
rational milestones.

So let’s say hypothetically you need to cut your burn from $3 million a month
to $2 million. We don’t want to sugarcoat this: It’s going to be hard. Of
course, a people-related cut is the hardest decision any leader makes. Beyond
this, you may face many challenging and nuanced decisions:

  * If you’re a global company, you might need to reevaluate certain markets.

  * If you’re a company that’s relied on a marketing or sales investment in order to grow, you might have to reevaluate your strategy.

  * You might have to increase pricing. This is scary, especially if you don’t have time to fully test the value proposition.

The big thing to remember is this: If you take the steps necessary to extend
your runway in line with rational milestones, confident you and your whole
company will be better on the other side.

So Overall :

  * You likely need more runway than you think.

  * Ultimately, your next round will be based on your metrics, which is going to be reflected in your financials.

  * Be real about what bucket you’re in. Think most companies are in Bucket 2, which is more than 12 months of cash, but need to make some changes.

  * You have what you need to win. You can execute and we’re here to help you do that

##### **📄 QUICK WIN**

Founders often struggle with pricing their products correctly early on. Many
make the mistake of setting prices based on their costs, especially in non-
software startups. While this might seem logical, it’s not the best approach.
Here’s why you should consider “unreasonable” pricing instead:

**The Problem with Cost-Based Pricing**

  1. It doesn’t account for the value you’re providing to customers.

  2. It can limit your growth potential and ability to invest in improving your product.

  3. It may attract price-sensitive customers who aren’t your ideal target market.

**The Benefits of “Unreasonable” Pricing**

  1. **Identifying Your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**

     * High initial prices help you quickly identify customers who feel the pain point most acutely.

     * These customers are willing to pay more for a solution, even if it’s not perfect yet.

  2. **Validating Market Demand**

     * If people are willing to pay a premium, it confirms there’s a strong need for your product.

     * This validation can save weeks of experiments and help you focus on the right target audience.

  3. **Accelerating Product Development**

     * Higher initial revenue allows you to invest more in improving your product faster.

     * You can build specifically for your ICP, ensuring product-market fit.

**Real-World Example**

I see a lot of founders launch a website, with:

Also, set the initial price on the higher end. Despite this - they have seen
good outcomes of getting a few people onboard 5-6, why? They felt the pain
point so strongly that they wanted it solved at all costs.

**The Inverse Relationship**

There’s an inverse relationship between how painful a problem is and how
“perfect” the product needs to be:

**When to Launch**

Once your product is 70-80% ready for your ICP, they will likely convert. If
not, it may indicate that the problem isn’t worth investing more time into, as
the product will be hard to grow.

**Long-Term Strategy**

While starting with “unreasonable” pricing can be beneficial, it’s important
to note that this approach isn’t permanent. As you grow and expand your
market, you may need to adjust your pricing strategy. However, the initial
high pricing helps validate the market, identify your ICP, and provide capital
leverage for faster growth.

Remember, don’t let perfect be the enemy of good. If you’re solving a truly
painful problem, **your early adopters will be willing to pay a premium for an
imperfect solution.**

Even in one of the previous writeups, we have shared **[5
frameworks](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/i/161364764/how-to-price-your-
product)** that can help you to find the best pricing strategy for your
startup.

Spotify created the [DIBB Framework](https://artkai.io/blog/dibb-
framework?utm_source=houck.news&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fundraising-
is-a-tactic-not-a-goal) to help align its entire organization around a
consistent decision-making process. It helps founders derive insights from
their data and identify the right calculated risks to take.

There are four parts to it:

  * **Data** → Gather and analyze accurate data that are relevant to the problem you’re solving

  * **Insight** → Look for patterns, trends, and insights in the data to inform decision-making

  * **Belief** → Create a hypothesis based on your insights and gain conviction

  * **Bet** → Test your beliefs with action and define expected outcomes

What I like about this is that it feels very similar to what founders
naturally do: collect data points/trends, identify an opportunity, gain a
conviction, and then take a shot at it.

Not all of your bets will work out, but that’s ok — you shouldn’t expect them
all to. The important thing is that each bet is focused on driving your
startup’s North Star goals.
