##### **📜 DEEP DIVE**

Most startups think growth means spending more - on ads, content, or PR. But
some of the fastest-growing companies did the opposite. They built something
useful instead of something promotional.

Think of a free calculator, tool, or app that solves a small problem for your
target users and quietly pulls them into your world.

That’s Engineering-as-Marketing, using your product or engineering skills to
build something that markets itself. It turns developer time into
distribution.

> The idea is simple: help first, sell later.
>
> You give users something valuable before asking for anything in return,
> earning trust, attention, and organic word-of-mouth.

This concept, popularised by [Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares in
Traction](https://www.amazon.in/Traction-Startup-Achieve-Explosive-
Customer/dp/1591848369), has quietly powered growth for companies like
HubSpot, Clearbit, and many SaaS startups.

> As the saying goes: “The best marketing is when you don’t know it’s
> marketing.” A useful tool doesn’t feel like an ad — yet it builds goodwill,
> traffic, and brand authority all the same.

**1\. It’s an underused channel.**

Most startups compete in crowded spaces ads, SEO, or social content. But few
invest in building small, free tools. That makes this approach less
competitive and often far more memorable.

As investor Andrew Chen noted, [marketing channels lose
effectiveness](https://andrewchen.substack.com/p/every-marketing-channel-
sucks-right) over time, but new, underutilised ones offer early-mover
advantage.

**2\. It gives value upfront, not a sales pitch.**

A well-built tool helps your audience do something, not just read something.
That shift from selling to assisting lowers friction and builds genuine trust.
Users get value before they even think of becoming customers.

**3\. It compounds over time.**

A side project that ranks on Google or spreads on social keeps generating
leads long after launch. Unlike ads that stop when you stop paying, a great
tool works 24/7.

Example: [HubSpot’s Website
Grader,](https://www.hubspot.com/blog/bid/5539/website-grader-analyzes-
over-2-million-sites) launched in 2006, analysed over 3 million websites and
still drove thousands of new leads nearly a decade later. Dharmesh Shah calls
such tools “marketing assets with ongoing returns.”

**4\. It drives virality and SEO naturally.**

Free, novel tools get shared by users, blogs, and media. They attract
backlinks, improve SEO, and often go viral without paid promotion. A clever
twist or perfect timing can turn a simple project into a PR flywheel, exposure
that money can’t easily buy.

From SaaS startups to consumer brands, many companies have grown by building
free, useful tools that do their marketing for them. Below are standout B2B
examples showing how these side projects became repeatable lead machines.

**HubSpot -Website Grader**

HubSpot’s [Website Grader](https://www.hubspot.com/blog/bid/5539/website-
grader-analyzes-over-2-million-sites) remains one of the most iconic examples
of engineering-as-marketing.

  * Users could enter any URL to get an instant score on SEO, mobile, and social performance, plus actionable improvement tips.

  * It went viral in marketing circles: over **3 million websites** graded and still generating leads years later.

  * The tool subtly connected each improvement suggestion to HubSpot’s own paid products, turning a free report into a sales funnel.

> Dharmesh Shah calls it a “marketing asset with ongoing returns” — proof that
> one well-built tool can compound for years.

**Shopify - Free business tools suite**

Shopify took the concept further by launching dozens of free tools for
entrepreneurs:

  * Logo maker, business name generator, invoice creator, privacy policy generator, and more.

  * Each solved a common problem for aspiring store owners, earning millions of users and tens of thousands of backlinks.

  * Their Hatchful logo generator became a top funnel source — users designing logos often turned into Shopify store founders.

By solving early-stage pain points for entrepreneurs, Shopify built massive
awareness long before any sales pitch.

**Ahrefs - Free SEO tools**

Ahrefs used a “free sample” model. They released lightweight versions of their
paid SEO tools, backlink checkers, keyword generators, and SERP analysers.

  * These tools attract small businesses who aren’t ready to pay yet but experience Ahrefs’ data quality firsthand.

  * Over time, many free users convert once they need deeper insights.

**Moz - FollowerWonk & Open Site Explorer**

Moz grew early by offering free, niche utilities for marketers:

  * FollowerWonk analysed Twitter audiences.

  * Open Site Explorer helped check backlinks. Each solved a focused problem, drew Moz’s ideal users, and built backlinks from blogs and agencies that referenced the tools.

**SparkLoop - Magic one-click subscribe**

SparkLoop launched a tiny but powerful free tool called **Magic** \- a one-
click subscription link that newsletter writers can embed in emails.

  * Newsletters using Magic saw 20–50% higher signups.

  * It solved a real distribution pain point for creators and positioned SparkLoop as the go-to for newsletter growth. Once users’ lists grew, many naturally upgraded to SparkLoop’s paid referral system. A perfect example of a free tool that complements the core product.

Engineering-as-marketing isn’t just for software or SaaS products. Consumer
brands have also used creative side projects, from physical products to
storytelling campaigns, to capture attention and drive awareness in
unconventional ways.

**Airbnb - “Obama O’s” cereal campaign**

In 2008, during the U.S. election, Airbnb’s founders created limited-edition
cereal boxes parodying the presidential candidates: _“Obama O’s”_ and _“Cap’n
McCain.”_

  * It started as a fun side project but quickly became a viral PR moment.

  * The team sold out 1,000 boxes in 24 hours, earning $30,000 in revenue.

  * More importantly, the stunt landed them national media coverage and TV appearances, putting Airbnb’s name in front of millions.

**Away - Travel photo book**

Away, the direct-to-consumer luggage brand, created a luxury coffee table book
about travel — featuring stories and photos from 40 influencers.

  * They printed just 2,000 copies, sold them for $225 each, and sold out quickly.

  * The goal wasn’t profit — it was positioning. The book earned coverage in travel and lifestyle media, reinforcing Away’s identity as a modern, design-forward travel brand.

  * It also created indirect awareness for their luggage line through association with taste, inspiration, and aspirational storytelling.

Many consumer brands have used similar side projects to create buzz or deepen
engagement.

The idea isn’t always to sell directly — it’s to offer something fun, useful,
or culturally relevant that draws people into your ecosystem.

Whether it’s a viral PR stunt, a beautifully designed side product, or a
lightweight app, the principle stays the same: give people something
delightful or useful first — and they’ll remember your brand later.

Even if you’re a small startup or solo founder, you can use this strategy on a
tight budget. The key is being deliberate about what you build, how you launch
it, and how it connects to your business. Here’s a practical framework you can
follow.

**1\. Generate ideas for a valuable side project**

Start by identifying what kind of tool, resource, or experience would
genuinely attract your ideal customers.

**Study your audience’s problems:** Think about what small but recurring tasks
or frustrations your target users deal with. The best ideas often come from
observing their workflow.

  * If you run an e-commerce platform, new merchants need logos and names → build a logo or name generator.

  * If you sell marketing software, marketers crave performance insights → build a grader or calculator.

The tool should complement your core product, not replace it. You want to
highlight the problem your paid product solves — without giving the full
solution away.

**Look at your own content and FAQs:**

Your existing blog posts or FAQs can hint at tool ideas. A popular article
like “How to Calculate LTV” could easily become a Customer Lifetime Value
Calculator. Likewise, explore Reddit, Quora, or niche forums where your
audience hangs out. What questions are they asking repeatedly?

Each recurring question is potential inspiration for a simple tool that
answers it interactively.

**Check competitors’ free tools:**

See if other players in your space have launched calculators, generators, or
widgets. Analyse how well they’ve performed — then find ways to improve them.
If their tool is outdated or clunky, build a smoother version or add a twist.
Competitor tools validate market interest, and your improved version can
outperform them.

**Decide between product-oriented vs. audience-oriented ideas:**

  * Product-oriented projects connect closely to what you sell. Example: Kapwing’s free video converter naturally draws users who might upgrade to its full video editor.

  * Audience-oriented projects target the same people but through broader interests. Example: Shopify’s logo generator attracts entrepreneurs, not just e-commerce founders.

Both approaches work — product-oriented tools convert better; audience-
oriented ones expand awareness. The best ideas solve a side problem your
target users face, even before they need your product.

Filter your ideas with one question: Would this be genuinely useful to my
audience even if they never buy anything from us?

If the answer is yes, and the idea is small enough to build quickly, move to
the next step.

**2\. Build it lean (use minimal engineering)**

You don’t need a big engineering team or fancy UI to make an impact. Focus on
delivering value fast with the simplest possible version.

**Keep it simple:** The best tools do one thing exceptionally well. A clean
calculator or generator can outperform a complex app. Avoid signups, long
forms, or features that slow people down. A tool someone can use in seconds —
and immediately benefit from — is more likely to spread.

**Use no-code or low-code platforms:**  
You can now build interactive tools without touching code.

  * **Outgrow** and **Calconic** for calculators and quizzes.

  * **Bubble** for more advanced web apps.

  * Or mix free APIs and open-source scripts if you’re a bit technical.  
Many founders have launched side projects in a weekend using these resources.

**Time-box the build:**

Set a clear deadline — one to two weeks max. This keeps you from over-
polishing. Knowledge Officer, for example, built a tool to access blocked
Medium articles in just two days — it went live, spread fast, and delivered
results.

If you’re technical, use your agility as an edge. If not, combine simple
tools, freelancers, or no-code builders. Speed is the real advantage here.

**Mind the user experience:**

Fast, reliable, and intuitive beats flashy design. Test enough to ensure it
works as promised. Add brief instructions and error handling, but avoid
forcing users to sign up.

A good principle: _deliver value before asking for anything._ A seamless, no-
friction experience increases both trust and shareability.

Once the MVP is live and stable, shift focus from building to distribution.

**3\. Launch, promote, and scale**

Even the best side project needs visibility. Your goal is to generate launch
buzz, then sustain discovery through SEO and backlinks.

**Plan a high-impact launch:** Treat it like a product launch.

  * Post on **Product Hunt** , **Hacker News** , **Reddit** , or niche forums where your audience spends time.

  * Reach out to relevant blogs, newsletters, or micro-influencers — many are eager to feature new, useful tools.  
A few days of coordinated launch effort can create a traffic spike and attract
your first wave of users organically.

**Design for virality:** You can’t guarantee virality, but you can _engineer
shareability_.

  * Add humor, surprise, or timeliness.

  * Let users share personalized results or badges.

  * Tie your tool to trending topics (like GDPR, AI, or elections).  
Airbnb’s cereal boxes and Mailjet’s GDPR quiz both worked because they were
timely, fun, and easy to talk about.

**Optimise for SEO and long-term traffic:** After launch buzz fades, search
will become your most consistent source of users.

  * Target queries like “<topic> calculator,” “free <tool name>,” or “<problem> checker.”

  * Host the tool on your main domain (e.g., yoursite.com/tool) to transfer link equity.

  * Include descriptive copy and keywords for SEO, but keep it secondary to usability.

  * Link to the tool internally from blogs and your homepage.  
When your tool genuinely helps users, other sites will naturally link to it —
creating a compounding traffic loop.

**Capture value softly:** Your free tool’s goal is to help first — but don’t
miss chances to guide users toward your product.

  * Add a relevant CTA like “Need more advanced features? Try our full platform free for 14 days.”

  * Offer an optional “Download full report by email” to capture leads.

  * 

**Iterate and maintain:**

Monitor how users engage. Fix bugs, add small improvements, and respond to
feedback.

If a project performs well, scale it or add new ones. Many startups eventually
build a suite of free tools (Shopify, Moz, and HubSpot all did).  
One great, reliable tool will outperform multiple mediocre ones — so focus on
quality and longevity.

To sum it up:

  * Find an idea that genuinely helps your audience (a few hours).

  * Build a minimal, working version (a few days).

  * Launch it like a product, optimise for SEO, and let it compound.

Engineering-as-Marketing works because it flips the playbook, instead of
shouting for attention, you quietly earn it by being useful.

In a crowded market, this approach stands out because it feels human. Users
get something genuinely useful. You earn trust, traffic, and credibility — all
before making a pitch. That’s why engineering-as-marketing continues to work:
it’s marketing that doesn’t _feel_ like marketing.

Start small. Build something your customers would genuinely thank you for —
and let that goodwill compound into long-term growth.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

When ChatGPT launched in late 2022, it didn’t just disrupt Google; it nearly
erased every AI-powered search startup overnight.

For You.com, once branded as the “search engine that puts you in control,” the
shift was existential. Competing with OpenAI’s viral chatbot on consumer
search wasn’t sustainable.

Instead of fighting a losing battle for eyeballs, founder [Richard
Socher,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardsocher/) an NLP researcher and
former Salesforce chief scientist, made one of the [smartest startup
pivots](https://thenewstack.io/how-you-com-survived-chatgpt-with-a-pivot-to-
enterprise-ai/) in recent AI history: from consumer search to enterprise AI
infrastructure.

**1\. The Pivot That Saved the Company**

Before ChatGPT, You.com tried to be an AI-driven Google alternative, combining
search with generative answers through products like YouCode. When ChatGPT
redefined user behaviour, Socher recognised the market signal immediately:
search wasn’t where the next wave of value would come from, enterprise data
was.

By early 2023, You.com rebranded around one mission: “Enterprise AI search.”
The homepage dropped its Google-style search bar in favour of API demos and
enterprise calls to action.

The company stopped chasing consumer traffic and started powering enterprise
products instead — including DuckDuckGo, Harvey AI, Windsurf, and Databricks.

> Don’t compete with giants where they have infinite distribution. Find where
> your infrastructure, not your interface, provides leverage.

**2\. Building Infrastructure, Not Interfaces**

Today, You.com isn’t a search engine; it’s a **search infrastructure
company.** It provides API-based web and data retrieval systems designed to
integrate with enterprise AI tools. Unlike most competitors who rely on
Google’s APIs, You.com built and maintains its own independent index — a
massive advantage now that Google has restricted API access.

Its systems can query hundreds of sources, generate reports, cite data inline,
and even produce visualisations. For example, an analyst can ask:

> “Benchmark the top five aerospace incumbents entering the eVTOL market.”  
> The system fetches from 400+ sources, summarizes insights, and returns a
> full report — with citations and charts.

> If your product’s value depends on another platform’s data or APIs, you’re
> building on sand. Own your data layer as early as possible.

**3\. The Agent Era Is the Next Frontier**

By 2025, every enterprise AI startup mentions “agents” — but You.com is
actually delivering on that promise.

  * Customers have built **nearly 100,000 custom agents** using You.com’s platform.

  * These range from **financial analysis bots** parsing 10-K filings to **procurement agents** that auto-generate outreach materials.

  * Its orchestration layer, called **Auto Mode** , lets companies combine multiple LLMs dynamically and delegate tasks across them.

Socher’s framing is simple:

> “In 5–10 years, if you’re not using an agent, you’re doing repetitive work
> you should’ve delegated to AI.”

> The real opportunity isn’t in chatbots — it’s in _agent infrastructure_. The
> startups that help others build, orchestrate, and deploy AI agents will
> define the next decade.

**4\. Competing in the Enterprise AI Market**

Socher sees You.com’s main rivals not as OpenAI or Anthropic, but as **Google
and SERP API providers**. Cohere and Vectara? “Adjacent.” His logic: You.com
integrates multiple LLMs instead of training its own, using open-source models
fine-tuned for specific tasks.

Its pitch to enterprises:

  * Full orchestration across multiple models.

  * Auto-selection of the best model for each query.

  * A composable API layer that unifies search, data, and AI outputs.

That model just helped You.com raise $100 million to scale.

> The most defensible position in AI isn’t model training — it’s orchestration
> and infrastructure. Enterprises don’t want another model; they want control,
> compliance, and speed.

The shift from search to AI orchestration mirrors how the internet itself
evolved — from browsers to platforms, from discovery to delegation. Founders
building in AI today must decide: are you creating the interface users see, or
the infrastructure everyone depends on?

You.com picked the latter, and that’s why it’s still alive.
