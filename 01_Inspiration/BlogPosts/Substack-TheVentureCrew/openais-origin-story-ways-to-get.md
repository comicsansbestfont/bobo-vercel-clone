##### **START WITH**

PitchBook [analysed](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/vcs-love-to-claim-
theyre-independent-thinkers-the-data-is-more-complicated) the top 20 US VC
firms and found that, on average, 38% of their deals involved at least one
other top-20 firm. So much for “contrarian” investing.

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3nbl!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-
post-
media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d12264e-0c25-446c-96c1-5d25cc56a879_1720x1456.png)_*Syndication
Rate refers to the percentage of deals a VC firm does alongside at least one
other top-tier VC firm_

Benchmark had the highest syndication rate, 55% of its deals included another
top firm. Redpoint followed at 49%. Meanwhile, Upfront Ventures stood out for
going mostly solo, with only 19% syndication.

What’s driving this?

  * Later-stage rounds are larger, and co-leading makes fund math work

  * Co-investing reduces risk and appeals to founders wanting multiple strong partners

  * But it often means smaller stakes and blurred ownership and leadership

> “Usually when there are two leads, there’s no lead.”

The tension: LPs want GPs with original edge. But many VCs hedge by following
the herd. Independent thinking? Still rare. ([Detailed report

independent-thinkers-the-data-is-more-complicated))

Long before OpenAI, Peter Thiel was funding a then-unknown Eliezer Yudkowsky,
whose obsession with accelerating (and later restraining) AI development set
off a chain reaction that would eventually reach Sam Altman.

Here’s the sequence that changed everything:

  * Yudkowsky introduced Shane Legg (DeepMind cofounder) to the idea of superintelligence

  * Yudkowsky later introduced Legg and Demis Hassabis to Thiel, who became DeepMind’s first major backer

  * Thiel discussed DeepMind with Altman, sparking Altman’s public writing on AGI and eventual launch of OpenAI

  * Years later, the same rationalist/EA movement Yudkowsky helped shape would play a role in Altman’s ousting

> “You don’t understand how Eliezer has programmed half the people in your
> company to believe this stuff.” — Thiel, warning Altman before his brief
> removal from OpenAI

From sci-fi mailing lists to summit dinners, this isn’t just a tech story,
it’s a reminder that most revolutions start in weird corners of the internet.

sam-altman/))

After peaking in 2021, funding for female-founded startups dropped sharply,
but has now started to stabilize. While the share of deals going to women-led
startups is lower than past years, the share of total capital raised is
starting to rebound.

Key insights from 16 years of PitchBook data:

  * Female-founded companies are securing larger rounds, even if deal volume is down

  * Trends vary by state, industry, and stage with some areas showing stronger recovery

  * Monthly updates are now tracking capital flow into women-led startups

Progress is happening, but unevenly. Capital is consolidating around fewer,
larger bets. Worth watching closely if you back or build with female founders.

European VC funds beat US funds on returns in most quarters since the 2022
downturn, but this outperformance may be temporary.

In early 2022, Europe posted 44.3% one-year IRR vs 29.1% in the US. When
things got worse, the US fell harder (-17.1% in Q4 2022) than Europe (-10% in
Q1 2023). Europe also bounced back faster.

Why?

  * European funds skew earlier-stage, which are less tied to public markets

  * Lower valuations meant smaller corrections

  * Europe relies more on M&A vs IPOs for exits, which held steadier

But the momentum is shifting.

  * US dealmaking and exits are picking up in 2025

  * Europe still has record dry powder (€73B), but deployment is cautious

  * The IRR gap may close or reverse if US liquidity keeps accelerating

> “Europe became a safe haven during the downturn, but the US still drives
> global venture momentum.” ([Read the detailed

##### **SOMETHING MORE**

Most people overthink SEO or declare it dead. But the truth is, if you're
building online and ignoring organic traffic, you're playing with a handicap.

Here’s a dead-simple strategy someone used to take multiple projects from 0 to
record-breaking organic traffic, all in just 45 days:

  * Spent 2 weeks doing real keyword research (no shortcuts)

  * Targeted long-tail keywords big sites ignored

  * Wrote 1 high-quality post per day with visuals, data, and actual utility

  * Used AI to assist, not replace, human thought

The goal wasn’t just to rank, it was to make the current #1 result look lazy.

Why this matters now more than ever: LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini don’t crawl
the entire web. They search engines and recommend top-ranking content. If
you’re not ranking, you’re invisible, not just to people, but to AI too.

One quote stuck with me:

> “Write content so useful, even AI can’t ignore it.”

It’s a great reminder that in a world of endless noise, quality still wins. If
you're curious, the [full post
](https://x.com/imMedhansh/status/1948008278581223737)breaks it all down step-
by-step.

Bootstrapped founders start with max stress: no cash, no safety net,
everything depends on them. But that pressure builds focus, every decision
must drive revenue.

You learn customer needs deeply, track every dollar, and build lean systems
because you have to.

VC-backed founders start with leverage: cash, talent, speed. But the stress
shifts to maximizing opportunity, justifying valuation, and racing
competitors. It's not “will we survive?” it's “how big can we go, how fast?”

Over time:

> “The stress never disappears—it just changes shape. Choose the one you’re
> built for.”

Different games. Different scoreboards. Both can win. ([Full post

[Greg Isenberg shares
](https://x.com/gregisenberg/status/1945588944751526334)the clearest playbook
I’ve seen:

  * Target boring industries still run on Excel (leasing, insurance, real estate ops)

  * Build small AI agents that each handle one step—PDFs, data checks, email drafts

  * Chain them into workflows that used to take full teams

Distribution is just as tactical:

  * Post 60-sec videos solving real problems

  * Give a lead magnet in every post

  * If CTR > 2%, scale with ads ($3/lead goal)

  * Ship a new lead magnet every 4 weeks

The funnel math:

> “Automate what still runs on humans and Excel.”

Niche pain → scalable agent system → repeat across verticals. Simple, smart,
compounding.

Most marketing advice is built for companies that already have traction or
money to burn. This one's different.

It’s a curated, no-fluff resource library built for early-stage founders.
Covers:

  * How to find your first users

  * How to promote with zero budget

  * What actually works before product-market fit

Topics include:

  * Where to post your startup

  * Cold outreach, SEO, landing pages

  * Social content, email, ads, influencers

  * Pricing, positioning, validation

> “Marketing is hard, especially when you’re broke. This guide is built for
> that stage.”

One of the most practical collections I’ve seen recently. [Here’s the

Jdvo) shared one of the best no-network fundraising tactics ans ways to get
intros

Instead of cold emailing 300 VCs, he recommends this step-by-step process:

  * Shortlist 30 top funds you actually want

  * Use Crunchbase to find their 3 most recent portfolio founders

  * Connect with those founders on LinkedIn

  * Email and ask for a quick chat about their experience with the fund

  * If the call goes well, ask for a warm intro

Why it works:

> “You don’t need a huge network. You just need a system.”

Here’s the 14-step process Toby recommends:

  1. Build a list of 300+ VCs

  2. Prioritize the top 10% (30 funds) based on thesis, connections, brand, and fit

  3. Filter for just those 30

  4. Go to Crunchbase

  5. Search each fund

  6. Find the 3 most recent investments

  7. Note founder names, sites, and companies

  8. Repeat for all 30 funds

  9. Go to LinkedIn

  10. Send a connection request to every founder

  11. Open your email

  12. Email each founder asking about their experience (include a short, warm note)

  13. Do the calls, be genuinely curious

  14. If it goes well, ask for the intro
