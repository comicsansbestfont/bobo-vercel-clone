##### **TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

Product-market fit is one of those concepts that seems easy to understand as a
concept but in practice, hard or impossible to articulate what it means.

**Most people lazily say** "Product-market fit is like porn...when you see it,
you just know!" But what does that mean? So in today’s newsletter will try to
share one of the most exhaustive and practical guides to find PMF. Let’s deep
dive into it:

**Product/Market Fit** can be concretely defined as a scenario:

[](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/)Source: Paul Graham Essays

  * When users/customers begin to use/buy your product/service and recognize its value proposition.

  * They continue to buy from you (high retention)

  * They rave about the great experiences with your company and encourage others to buy from you (strong word of mouth).

  * And, you are able replicate to this same experience with every new referred user/customer.

We can then say that you've achieved the product/market fit

> "Product Market Fit means being in a good market with a product that can
> satisfy that market"

\- Marc Andreessen.

> "Product-Market Fit is all about making something that (lots of) people
> want"

\- Paul Graham, Y Combinator.

> "Product/Market Fit is when (people) your customers sell for you (strong
> word of mouth)"

\- Josh Porter.

> Product/Market Fit is the only thing that matters

\- Marc Andreessen.

  * 90% of startups and 70% of startups that raised Series A end up as failures!

  * **Lack of Product/Market Fit** is the most common reason behind "why startups fail."

  * "**Finding the Product/Market Fit is the hardest challenge for all startups** ", not now as this guide will help you find PMF.

If you're an early-stage startup then **product/market fit should be your only
focus** in your journey instead of fundraising. Start working on the PMF if
you still haven't.

**Scaling a Pre-product market fit startup is almost a sure-shot way to kill
it**!

> In 1999, I built a failed dot com. Initially raised from F&F, and scaled
> before product-market fit. Never did I find it (PMF). Kept on raising in
> future - $3 M, then $20 M on $100 M valuation. Hired dozens of high-priced
> executives, bought a fancy space in LA, and even made an acquisition.
> **Don't** (ever) **be like me** \- Micah Rosenbloom.

"The most successful technology companies (i.e. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter,
etc.,) first got their product/market fit right before even stepping on the
accelerator (of growth)."

> It takes time for a startup to find product/market fit. In my experience, it
> roughly takes 1-5+ years. And "**it's much easier to do this with a small
> team, low burn, and extreme focus** " - Michael Siebel, Partner-YC.

Harsh Truth: 3 out of 5 startups would never find their PMF, and would fail.

People often say funnily, "Product-market Fit is like porn...when you see it,
you just know."

In qualitative terms ...

[](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/)Image Source: David Rusenko, Weebly

"When the customers aren’t quite getting much value out of the
product/service, word of mouth isn’t spreading, usage isn’t growing that fast
(spikes in the months where you advertise), press reviews are kind of “blah”,
the sales cycle takes too long, and most of the deals never close" - [Marc
Andreessen](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html).

Most startups that have raised ($5-$10 Mn) Series A funding, assume they’ve
got a product-market fit, just because they’ve raised funding. They're wrong,
why do you think 70% of startups that raised Series A still fail, because the
no.1 reason was lack of PMF!

On a high level, you've found product market fit when you can repeatably
acquire customers for a lower cost (CAC) than what they are worth (LTV) to you

\- Elizabeth Yin

“You can always feel when Product/Market Fit is happening. The customers are
buying the product just as fast as you can make it - or usage is growing just
as fast as you can add more servers. Money from customers is piling up in your
company's account.

[](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/)Image Source: David Rusenko, Weebly

You’re hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can. Reporters
are calling because they’ve heard about your hot new thing and they want to
talk to you about it.” - [Marc
Andreessen](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html)

> When product-market fit occurs something magical happens, all of a sudden
> your customers become your salespeople i.e. they sell for you - Josh Porter.

Let's delve into quantitative metrics of finding Product/Market Fit:

David Rusenko recommends that founders offering SaaS should track the below f
metrics to evaluate Product/Market Fit:

  1. **Returning Usage** (Day 1,3,7,30 retention): Look at people who sign up to your site/app and then look at the number of people who return back within 1,3,7,30 day/s. This should indicate whether things are working or aren't.

  2. **A Net Promoter Score** (**NPS**) of > 50 means you’re doing well.

  3. **Paying Customer Renewal Rates** or **Retention** : Renewal rate is defined as the number of people who are eligible to renew and what percentage of people actually renewed is a lot better metric than churn. **Churn rate** (Churned customers / total customers) is a lot easier to measure, but it can be deceiving at times.

  4. **Growth Rate** : Consistent growth of at least 15% in MRR and ARR is a strong indicator of Product/Market Fit. Irregular spikes, flattening, or declining growth are some of the red flags to watch for.

  5. **Market Share** : How quickly are you gaining/losing the market share?

  6. **Customer Lifetime Value** (CLV) vs. **Customer Acquisition Costs** (CAC): A ratio of 3X and a CAC payback of < 18 months is ideal for SaaS startups.

Rahul Vora in this [article](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-
built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit) shares how he used a "simple
survey" to assess whether his venture (Superhuman) has achieved the
Product/Market Fit. Here's how you can replicate it:

Survey all your users with this simple question:

Q. **How disappointed would you feel if you could no longer use our
product/service**?

  * Very disappointed

  * Somewhat disappointed

  * Not disappointed

The magic number that indicates the Product Market Fit is when > **40%** of
users respond as “very disappointed.” The companies that struggle on the same
can barely even touch 40%.

> 51% of Slack users responded that they would be very disappointed without
> Slack, revealing that it had indeed attained product/market fit.

[Rajan Anandan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoQkLis1pGM) MD, Sequoia
Capital recommends two simple methods to evaluate, whether you've achieved the
product/market fit:

The **retention curve** is what percentage of your users keep coming back over
some time while using your product/service.

Essentially, there are 3 kinds of retention curves, and you should plot this
curve by day, week, or month, once you launch your product.

a. **Declining Curve** (dark grey line), let's say you’ve launched a consumer
internet app on day 0, and every week your retention rate declines by 10%,
which essentially means that by the end of 3rd month, all your initial users
would have churned, then that's a declining curve, which indicates that you
don’t have a product-market fit.

b. **Flattening Curve** (orange line) is actually good, although it kind of
varies depending upon the category (HealthTech, EdTech, etc.,) but generically
speaking if the retention curve flattens between 20%-40% that could be quite
good.

c. Finally the best one is the **Smiling Retention Curve** (green line), which
means that retention drops but then as time goes on you keep reactivating
users, which indicates that you're getting close to your product-market fit.

**Net Promoter Score** (NPS) is a metric that organizations use to measure
customer loyalty toward their brand, product or service. NPS works by asking
your customers a single question: "**How likely are you to recommend our
products/services to others**?"

If the magic score is = 70% or more, then you have an amazing product-market
fit. But if the number declines to 40% or below, then you don’t have it. It's
that simple!

  * Encourage founders to **continue to talk to customers, care about their customers, learn about their problems, and solve them effectively** \- Michael Siebel, Partner-YC.

  * Most founders seek ineffective shortcuts to achieve Product/Market Fit (PMF) i.e. hiring a ton of engineers, bringing on senior executives, running after key partnerships, etc. These shortcuts never work.

  * If you don't have Product/Market Fit, **keep your burn low, and keep iterating fast with a lean team**. You may get pressure to spend from your VCs (this usually happens), push back hard - Elizabeth Yin, Co-founder of Hustle Fund.

  * **If you haven't reached Product/Market Fit, avoid growing your team above 10 people**. Post-raising a seed round, most founders are tempted to grow the team. Smaller teams can adapt/iterate much quicker - Immad Akhund, Co-founder & CEO, Mercury.

That’s it for today.

##### **TODAY’S QUICK DIVE**

In a recent[ survey](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/survey-gps-plan-to-
ramp-up-fees-in-show-of-confidence) conducted by Dynamo Software with 100
global alternative asset managers, approximately 20% of respondents expressed
plans to increase management fees in the next 12 months. This marks a
significant rise from just over 5% at the beginning of 2023.

The shift is attributed to growing confidence among General Partners (GPs) as
they anticipate a recovery in dealmaking after a challenging period marked by
higher interest rates, depressed exits, and market uncertainty in 2023. The
report suggests that improved dealmaking conditions in 2024 will empower GPs
to negotiate better terms with Limited Partners (LPs), balancing fee
structures against anticipated returns.

Despite signs of improvement in fund performance in H1 2023, some industry
experts view the survey results as potentially overly optimistic, highlighting
that, from their perspective, overall fee percentages have not seen
significant changes. However, there is a noted decline in the common practice
of GPs offering fee discounts to LPs, a tactic used during fundraising
challenges.

This shift is seen as indicative of a potentially permanent change in
fundraising timelines, with LPs less incentivized to commit early without
discounts. Additionally, the increasing size of funds is expected to
contribute to a higher overall dollar count for fees, even if fee percentages
remain consistent.

A recent analysis of over 31,000 primary fundraises on[

venturecapital-
activity-7167967679536881666-zhDS?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
since 2015 reveals intriguing trends.

Notably, the average time from incorporation to each venture round has been
steadily increasing. As of 2023, the numbers tell: Seed rounds taking 1.6
years, Series A at 3.3 years, and subsequent rounds following suit.

Several factors contribute to this shift, including companies opting for more
funding through SAFEs, and elongating the time to initiate priced round
raises.

##### **FEATURED POST**

Young entrepreneurs often get screwed by their angel investors on convertible
notes and I know I can’t convince you not to do it so I’d like to offer one
simple bit of advice to help you avoid getting screwed.  

When you do a convertible note with a cap that converts into the next round of
funding, one of the unintended consequences is that if you’re successful and
raise at a larger price than your cap the early angels often get “multiple
liquidation preferences” on their dollars in.  

Here’s how it works..… **[Read More

If You Want To Build A Big Company, Start A Hard Company.  

"It's easier to build a hard company than an easy one. If you're building a
photo-sharing app, nobody bothers. But if you're building flying cars,
supersonic aeroplanes or nuclear power startups people proactively want to
help you for free because they want to be a part of this interesting thing.

And live example is Elon Musk! Everyone wants to see Elon be successful in his
businesses - SpaceX, Neuralink, Tesla & others."
