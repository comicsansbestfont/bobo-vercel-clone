##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

Running a startup can feel like captaining a boat through a storm. You’re
blindfolded. The compass is broken. And you’re mostly guessing.

That’s where a financial forecast model comes in. First thing - it won’t tell
you the future. But it will help you see what’s coming, make smarter
decisions, and stretch your cash in the right direction.

If “building a financial model” sounds complex, overwhelming, or like
something you’ll “do later”... good news: is it doesn’t have to be. We’ve
created a straightforward forecast model template you can copy, customize, and
actually use.

Let’s walk through why every founder (yes, even early-stage) should have
one—and what to focus on.

**1\. Cash is oxygen**

Forget “cash is king.” For startups, cash is _air._

Without it, you’re done. A forecast model helps you project income and
expenses across time, so you’re not surprised when the runway gets tight.
Instead of reacting when you're gasping, you’re making moves ahead of time.

**2\. Speak the language of money**

Investors. Board members. Loan officers. Even vendors.

They all want to see that you’ve got a handle on your finances. A forecast
model helps you show—not just say—that you’re building with a plan. It proves
you’re not winging it, even if it _feels_ like that some days.

**3\. Get better at saying no**

Startups are full of decisions that sound exciting: “Let’s ramp up ads!” or
“Let’s hire three more engineers!”

But can you afford to do that _and_ still build the product? A forecast model
helps you understand tradeoffs, prioritize resources, and stay focused on the
metrics that matter.

**4\. Know what really moves the needle**

Whether your goal is acquisition, profitability, or that next funding
round—your forecast helps you zoom out and see what truly impacts your
outcomes.

For example: improving retention by just 5% might move revenue way more than
launching that new feature you’re debating.

Let’s break it down into five core sections you should focus on, especially in
the early stages:

**1\. Customer acquisition**

Think about how you attract new customers. Break it into clear channels like:

  * Performance marketing: Ads, paid campaigns, etc. (Track CAC!)

  * Sales team productivity: Deals won per rep.

  * Organic growth: SEO, word of mouth, referrals.

Start simple—don’t overcomplicate with 10 variables per channel. Use broad
assumptions, then refine with real data over time.

**2\. Customer retention**

Acquiring a customer means nothing if you can’t keep them. Your model should
reflect how long customers stay, and when they tend to churn.

Use cohort analysis or a basic monthly churn rate. Ask:

Retention is also your best indicator of product-market fit.

**3\. Revenue**

Revenue should be tied directly to customer activity:

  * For SaaS, it’s subscription price × active customers.

  * For marketplaces, it could be volume × take rate.

Start with average revenue per user (ARPU), and evolve into more granular
views as you scale.

**4\. Expenses**

Your biggest expense? People.  
Use a headcount plan to map out salaries, hiring timelines, and team
functions. Other key categories include:

  * COGS: Hosting, inventory, services delivered.

  * Marketing spend: Performance + brand.

  * Tools & software: Scale with team size and complexity.

  * Office, travel, services: Keep it lean unless proven otherwise.

Don’t default to “% of revenue” unless you have no better data. You control
your budget—make it intentional.

**5\. Cash flow + runway**

At the end of the day, it’s about how long your cash lasts.  
Forecasting your runway (how many months you can operate before running out of
money) helps guide:

  * Fundraising timelines

  * Hiring plans

  * Growth investments

Always stress-test with multiple scenarios:

  * Best-case (aggressive growth)

  * Base-case (reasonable assumptions)

  * Worst-case (conservative path)

**Tips to get started (without burning out)**

  * Start simple. This isn’t a Wall Street IPO model. It’s your startup’s guiding tool.

  * Update monthly. Compare forecast vs. actuals. Adjust your assumptions.

  * Don’t aim for perfection. Aim for utility. It’s better to have a rough, usable model than a flawless one that sits unopened.

  * Think of it as a living document. Not a one-time exercise.

**Remember your forecast model = your strategy, in numbers**

You don’t build a model because investors ask. You build it to understand your
own business better. To make smarter decisions. To align your team. To spot
problems early and act on them.

“The real magic happens when you strike a balance between planning and doing.”

to create one for your startup.

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

Recently, I came across [a
tweet](https://x.com/andrewchen/status/1884292311947051309) by Andrew Chen
where he discussed how founders often fall into the trap of chasing virality,
only to end up with a flood of low-quality users. It resonated with me, so I
thought to share my thoughts and a few key points on this.

Every founder dreams of their product going viral. A flood of new users,
signups spiking, your app trending on Reddit and X—it’s the fantasy, right?
But when it happens, reality hits differently.

It starts slow. A small group of loyal users finds your product. They give
feedback. You iterate. Feels good. Then, one day, a funny video about your app
blows up. A major influencer shares it. Signups skyrocket. Feels even better.
But then, the Looky-Loos arrive.

**The Looky-Loo Problem**

**LOOKY-LOO (noun):** A person who checks something out with no real intent to
use it seriously.

Going viral doesn’t just bring more users—it brings the _wrong_ users. These
aren’t your ideal customers; they’re tourists. They try the product, poke
around, maybe share a meme, and then vanish. Your DAUs spike, but retention
doesn’t. Your revenue doesn’t. Your support inbox? Flooded with nonsense.

Suddenly, you’re dealing with international users who don’t fit your market,
edge cases breaking the product and chaotic community interactions. If your
growth is built on Looky-Loos, it’s not real growth—it’s noise.

**Easy Come, Easy Go**

The growth that happens fast usually disappears just as fast. Here’s what
happens next:

  * The traffic spike dies down after a few days.

  * The new users don’t stick around.

  * Engagement drops. Conversion rates tank. Your metrics look worse than before.

  * You scramble to create another viral moment—only to realize you can’t manufacture lightning twice.

Traction isn’t just about more users. It’s about high-intent users—people who
genuinely want your product and will stick around long-term.

**What Works**

Instead of chasing virality, focus on growth that’s **durable, scalable, and
valuable** :

  * Durable Growth: Users who keep coming back. Look at D1/D7/D30 retention, not just DAUs.

  * Scalable Growth: Repeatable acquisition channels—referrals, SEO, paid marketing—not just one-time spikes.

  * Valuable Users: Not all users are equal. Focus on those who engage deeply, pay, and spread word-of-mouth.

**When Spikes Can Work**

Some situations where a viral moment _can_ be useful:

  * Waitlists: Filtering users before letting them in keeps quality high.

  * Raising VC Money: A spike in traction can help close funding but don’t build a business _expecting_ virality.

  * Products Built for Churn**:** Some apps (e.g., AI photo generators) expect short-term use and monetize aggressively upfront.

  * Network Effects: If even 1% of a viral audience sticks, they can kickstart a community or marketplace.

**Focus on the Right Users**

Going viral might feel great, but it’s not a business strategy. Real traction
comes from gradual, consistent growth with users who care. Instead of chasing
DAU spikes, build something people love—because love, not virality, is what
makes a product last.

Also if you really want to learn about building real virality products that
last long, I would highly suggest checking this podcast - [Nikita Bier’s
Playbook for winning at consumer
apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY).

Deciding whether to offer a freemium model is a common dilemma for founders.
Many try out freemium strategies, but not all SaaS companies can replicate the
success of Dropbox or Typeform.

Done wrong, freemium can end up cannibalizing your paid user base while also
draining your company’s precious engineering and customer support resources.

So how can you determine if it's the right move for your company?

The most reliable way to find out is through A/B testing. However, getting
solid results can take a long time, especially if you're looking at the impact
on virality and your viral cycle is six months or longer.

If you can't wait that long or aren't set up for a full A/B test, consider
these "Three Factors for Freemium Strategy":

  1. **Does your paid plan have a gross margin of 80–90%?**  
If you have a lower gross margin — for example because your product is not
fully self-service, requires extensive customer support or is extremely costly
in terms of tech infrastructure — freemium will probably not work for you.

  2. **Does your free plan attract the right audience?**  
If your free users are too different from your paying users, your free-to-
paying conversion will be low — and you’ll risk developing your product for
the wrong audience.

  3. **Is your product inherently viral?**  
If your answer is no, that doesn’t make it a complete no-go, but it does mean
that it’s much less likely that freemium is right for you.

In the end, freemium only makes sense if a certain percentage of your free
users do one of three things:

  * Eventually, convert to paid,

  * Refer paying customers, or

  * Provide the kind of valuable feedback that will improve your product.

A freemium product that fails to achieve any of these effects will merely
saddle you with extra costs and distract you from servicing your most
important users.

Also, check out this interesting article on [why companies fail with
freemium](https://medium.com/swlh/why-do-companies-fail-with-
freemium-600e6b607127). I highly recommend it — definitely worth a read.

Spotify created the [DIBB Framework](https://artkai.io/blog/dibb-
framework?utm_source=houck.news&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fundraising-
is-a-tactic-not-a-goal) to help align its entire organization around a
consistent decision-making process. It helps founders derive insights from
their data and identify the right calculated risks to take.

There are four parts to it:

  * **Data** → Gather and analyze accurate data that are relevant to the problem you’re solving

  * **Insight** → Look for patterns, trends, and insights in the data to inform decision-making

  * **Belief** → Create a hypothesis based on your insights and gain conviction

  * **Bet** → Test your beliefs with action and define expected outcomes

What I like about this is that it feels very similar to what founders
naturally do: collect data points/trends, identify an opportunity, gain a
conviction, and then take a shot at it.

Not all of your bets will work out, but that’s ok — you shouldn’t expect them
all to. The important thing is that each bet is focused on driving your
startup’s North Star goals.
