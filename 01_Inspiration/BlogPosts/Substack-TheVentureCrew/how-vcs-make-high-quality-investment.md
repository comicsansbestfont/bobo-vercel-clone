Understanding how leading investment firms like Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital,
and Antler make investment decisions is a subject of great interest to many.
For a founder, understanding this process can be beneficial as it will help
them to get the mindset of investors and eventually help them to pitch in
front of investors.

In search of how VCs actually evaluate and make high-quality investment
decisions, I came across an interesting article related to this by [Frank
Moyes](https://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/moyes/html/bio.htm) & [Stephen
Lawrence](https://www.eloquens.com/channel/stephen-lawrence) and got to learn
so much practical stuff - which I am eager to share in this write-up. So grab
your morning coffee and let’s deep dive into it!

Just think from an investor’s perspective - what an investor wants from a
startup - Simple it’s a successful exit.

They seek a return equal to some multiple of their initial investment or they
aim at a specific internal rate of return.

`How do they make sure of that?  
How do they evaluate startups?`  

They make use of the **“[Venture Capital
Method.](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/decoding-startup-valuations-
with)”**

`This Venture Capital Method assumes that the startup will undertake an
Initial Public Offering (IPO) at some point in the future.`  

The Future Value of the Firm is determined by multiplying the earnings of the
firm in the year of IPO by the expected [Price/ Earnings (P/E)
](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp)ratio that the
market will support.  

**Let’s do simple mathematics to understand this.**  
Consider a VC firm that just received the startup deal which finds them
interesting and now how they are thinking about the potential -

Let’s make some assumptions:  
\- For a company, the month of IPO is 60 months from the First Investment  
\- Based on the Financial forecasting, the start-up’s Annualized Earnings at
IPO is $6m  
\- P/E Ratio at IPO= 15  
\- Market Capitalization at IPO= $6m*15= $90 m  

**VC Firm Investment Round:**  

**First Round at Month 0:**  
\- Investment Amount= $1m  
\- Expected IRR= 35%  
\- Duration of Investment= 60 months  

\- Firm Value at the Time of Investment  
= (Market Capitalization)/ ((1+Expected IRR)^(Duration of Investment/12))  
= $90m/ ((1+35%)^(60/12))  
= $20.07m  

\- Future Value of VC Investment at IPO  
= (First Investment Amount)* (1+Expected IRR)^(Duration of Investment/12)  
= $1m*(1+35%)^(60/12)  
= $4.48m  

\- VC Ownership %= Future Value of VC Investment/ Market Capitalization =
$4.48m/ $90 m= 5%  
\- Investor’s ROI= $4.48m/ $1m= 4.48X  

**Second Round at Month 12:**  
\- Investment Amount= $2m  
\- Expected IRR= 30%  
\- Duration of Investment= 48 months  

\- Firm Value at the time of Investment= $90m/ ((1+30%)^(48/12))= $31.51m  
\- Future Value of Investment at IPO= $2m*((1+30%)^(48/12))= $5.71m  
\- VC Ownership %= $5.71m/ $90m= 6.34%  
\- Investor’s ROI= $5.71m/ $2m= 2.86X  

**Third Round at Month 24:**  
\- Investment Amount= $3m  
\- Expected IRR= 25%  
\- Duration of Investment= 36 months  

\- Firm Value at the time of Investment= $90m/((1+25%)^(36/12))= $46.08m  
\- Future Value of Investment at IPO= $3m*((1+25%)^(36/12))= $5.86m  

\- VC Ownership %= $5.86m/ $90m= 6.5%  
\- Investor’s ROI= $5.86m/$3m= 1.95X  

\- VC Firm’s Ownership= 5%+ 6.34%+ 6.5%= 17.84%  
\- Founder’s Ownership= 100%- 17.84%= 82.16%

Now after doing this above analysis, the **VC Firm may negotiate** with the
Founder about their ownership percentage.  

\- Suppose after the first investment the VC Firm’s target ownership= 10%  
\- Future Value for Investor at IPO= $90m*10%= $9m  
\- Investor’s ROI= $9m/ $1m= 9X  
\- Investor’s IRR= ($9m/ $1m)^(12/60)-1= 55%  

**Second Round:**  
\- VC Firm’s target ownership= 7%  
\- Future Value for Investor at IPO= $90m*7%= $6.3m  
\- Investor’s ROI= $6.3m/ $2m= 3.15X  
\- Investor’s IRR= ($6.3m/$2m)^(12/48)-1= 33%  

**Third Round:**  
\- VC Firm’s target ownership= 6%  
\- Future Value for Investor at IPO= $90m*6%= $5.4m  
\- Investor’s ROI= $5.4m/ $3m= 1.8X  
\- Investor’s IRR= ($5.4m/$3m)^(12/36)-1= 22%  

\- VC Firm’s Ownership= 10%+7%+6%= 23%  
\- Founder’s Ownership= 100%-23%= 77%  

That’s it for today. I hope this helps you to understand the investor's
thought process.

**Join 4900+ Founders, VCs and startup Enthusiasts** Getting Tactical To
Build, Learn and implement Startups, Technology and venture Capital.

I read this article on why the top 1% of founders quit their startups, by the
entrepreneur handbook. It’s one of the interesting articles. So sharing the
summary of it.

“ Daniel Kang, Founder at YC and ex-investor at Softbank, shares a stark
reality about startups: _the leading cause of death for most early-stage, pre-
product-market fit companies is the breakdown and demoralization of founders,
referred to as**"The Struggle."**_ The reasons are manifold: limited control,
the pressure of results, and the harsh realities of personal finance.

Is quitting ever acceptable? It's a question rarely discussed, but Kang
suggests founders ask themselves a set of questions to reach that decision: Do
you have ideas left to grow your startup? Can you drive that growth
profitably? Do you want to work on the startup that results from that growth?
Do you want to work with your co-founders on the startup that results from
that growth? The answers could be the key.

In the age of AI, Daniel Rizea, Director of Engineering at Google, believes
trust will be the biggest competitive advantage. His Say/Do/Show formula
encapsulates the essence of building trust: Say what you will do, do it, and
show that you have done it. Avoid common pitfalls like forgetting to say what
you will do, not doing it, or not showing that you have done it.

_**Remember, in the world of startups, survival is the name of the game.**_
And in the age of AI, trust is your biggest asset.”
