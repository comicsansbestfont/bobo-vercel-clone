##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

When you think about Steve Jobs, you probably think of him as a pioneer of the
personal computer era, a passionate designer, and a creative genius who
introduced ground-breaking products.

Through his partnership with Apple, Pixar, and NeXT, he was able to transform
six industries (personal computers, music, cellular phones, animation, tablet
computers, and digital publishing).

In various interviews, he shared some wisdom and knowledge that I believe
every founder should consider in early product development. So, grab your
coffee, and let’s deep dive into 9 product development tactics that Steve Jobs
wishes every founder to follow.

**1\. Create With The Customer’s Experience In Mind.**

While watching this 1997 video of Steve Jobs at Apple’s [Worldwide Developers
Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference),
I was reminded of the significance of the customer experience. Jobs appears to
be responding to an attack in the video, but he’s doing something far more
interesting than what’s seen. He ponders and makes a philosophical point
regarding his – and Apple’s – approach to product development.

> “I’ve always found that you’ve got to start with the customer experience and
> work backwards for the technology. You can’t start with the technology and
> try to figure out where you’re going to try to sell it.
>
> As we have tried to come up with a strategy and a vision for Apple, it
> started with: What incredible benefits can we give to the customer? Where
> can we take the customer? Not starting with, Let’s sit down with the
> engineers and figure out what awesome technology we have and then how are we
> going to market that?_”_

Former Apple and Pepsi chief executive John Sculley recounts his conversations
with Steve Jobs about customer service. In his words, Steve’s approach was
always centred on the customer’s experience rather than the technology.

_The final product had to be top-notch, and while it might not be cost-
effective initially, it would be a better-looking and better-functioning one._

Some companies have made this notion a core part of their business model and
corporate culture. Three companies instantly spring to mind: Zappos, GoPro,
and Tesla Motors. These companies’ owners are utterly fixated on the way their
customers feel about using their products.

**2\. Don’t Ask Your Customers What They Want**

Jobs’ product-creation philosophy was to avoid asking customers what they
wanted because their answers would be predicated on what they already knew
based on existing products.

On the contrary, instead of focusing just on the functional needs of
customers, he observed what they were trying to accomplish on a social and
emotional level as well. He then brainstormed with creative minds and
engineers to come up with innovations to help people achieve their goals in
both life and work.

Henry Ford, the man who founded the Ford Motor Company, was another industrial
designer who operated under the same guiding principle. An unrelenting fervent
supporter of new technology, he worked to continually improve the design and
manufacturing processes of his products. In contrast to traditional methods of
market research, he did not solicit feedback from customers when making
product decisions.

> “If I’d done what my customers wanted, then I would have built a faster
> horse,” he famously declared.

Having said that, I believe Henry and Steve had a keen eye for human
behaviour.

They’ve freed designers (and engineers) to look at different ways to
commercialize innovations and avoid making the common blunder of letting the
“voice of the customer” decide the course of their evolution.

Likewise, Apple’s success with this approach can be seen in their Macintosh
version, which provided a whole new computing experience for customers.

**3\. Creativity Is About Connecting The Dots**

Steve thought that you needed to do a _‘zoom in, zoom out’_ technique. To make
connections, you zoom out; to simplify, you zoom in.

If you look at Apple’s breakthroughs, you’ll see that they always occur at the
confluence of several industries and technology.

His vision for the iPhone using 3G technology was the best example of this. In
the early days of [3G wireless technology](https://www.lifewire.com/what-
is-3g-3426465), he was able to connect the dots. While 2G was solely for
faxing, 3G was capable of a wide range of additional tasks, including taking
images.

Having designed the iPod before the iPhone, he was aware of the trend toward
smaller consumer gadgets. A phone chip in an iPod would allow individuals to
transmit photos wirelessly if he could connect the dots and provide more
screen real space, he reasoned.

In his own words, Steve said

> “Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they
> did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it,
> they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s
> because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new
> things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they’ve had more
> experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other
> people.”

**4\. Disruptive Innovation Is The Key Differentiator**

Unlike most companies, Jobs was constantly looking for ways to disrupt the
technology industry and even Apple’s market with low-cost, simpler solutions.

**How did he ensure that his companies stayed relevant through the years?**

The answer lies in his disruptive approach to innovation. Whether it’s the
original Mac GUI, the iMac, the iPod, iTunes or the iPhone, Steve Jobs has
changed the way we think about computers, music players, and cell phones since
his time at Apple.

The Macintosh revolutionised personal computing by making it more accessible
to the average person. When Apple iPods went on sale in 2001 (with an average
of 100 sales per minute), Steve Jobs changed the rules of the digital music
business. Following this, he launched the iTunes Music Store in 2003 which has
sold one billion songs since its inception.

Steve Jobs became a global media and entertainment industry titan after Disney
bought Pixar. Toy Story, their first box office smash, was made possible
thanks to his use of cutting-edge 3D animation technology.

With his core belief in disruptive innovation, Jobs demoted his beloved iMac
to the status of merely “another device” in 2011, when he announced that
iCloud would launch a suite of products that would allow people to live
without a personal computer.

Thus, Jobs repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to keep creating, even if
it meant sacrificing some of his company’s most successful product lines.

**5\. Simplify, Then Simplify Some More**

Jobs had an innate desire to make things simpler by concentrating on their
main function and removing extraneous features.

For example, when it came to the iPod’s design, Jobs was constantly looking
for new methods to minimise clutter. For him, it had to take three clicks to
get from here to there. He even proposed they do away with the on/off switch
at one point. Members of the crew were taken aback at first but quickly
concluded that the button was superfluous.

At the heart of the philosophy that guided Apple’s product design was
simplicity—not just a superficial simplicity that comes from a product’s
uncluttered look and feel and smooth surface—but a deep simplicity that comes
from understanding every product’s essence, its engineering complexity and the
function of each component.

“ _It takes a lot of hard work,”_ Jobs said, _“to make something simple, to
truly understand the underlying challenges and come up with elegant
solutions.”_ “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,” Apple’s 1977
marketing brochure proclaimed, and it went on to become a basic tenet for
product development that is still maintained today.

**6\. Design For The Future**

In 1983, Steve Jobs spoke to a gathering of designers in Aspen, Colorado,
during the International Design Conference (IDCA). During a time when the
majority of the world was uninformed of computers and much less likely to buy
one, Jobs sketched out a vision for the World Wide Web, iPad, App Store, Siri
and even Google Street View.

Saving time, maximizing resources, and optimizing the exchange of information
are the three core themes of all technological developments. By understanding
the factors influencing change, Jobs could see the inevitabilities in the
direction of progress.

Jobs was equally passionate about the evolution of his product’s design,
believing that it should enhance its entire functionality. It wasn’t simply
about font pairings, colour schemes, rounded edges, and tidy circuits; it was
about how this design aesthetics improved the user experience.

“ _Design is not just what it looks and feels like_ ,” he says, echoing these
ideas. “ _How it works is design_.”

**7\. Product Before Profit**

When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he gave a rousing speech to the
company’s top executives in which he outlined a fundamental premise of the
product development process.

_“Instead of focusing on maximizing profits, he explained, the goal was to
improve the design of the product._ ”

**He made certain two things to be to better enforce this rule:**

Firstly, the **organisation was based on job functions rather than business
units.** Rather than having to worry about fulfilling financial goals or being
profitable, teams could concentrate on product development and the customer
experience.

Secondly, **top management rewards were based on overall company performance**
across divisions rather than revenue from a single product. This made everyone
invested in the success of all their innovations and not just the ones they
were responsible for.

Thus, Jobs created an entrepreneur-centric culture at Apple, which has
contributed significantly to the company’s success.

**8\. Unconventional Thinking Is The Key Mantra**

As a counterintuitive revolutionary, Jobs popularised the slogan _“think
different”_ throughout his firm, displaying posters of history’s nonconformist
thinkers such as Gandhi, Albert Einstein, and Pablo Picasso in support of his
point of view.

> He capitalized on three important and powerful elements -  
> the power of design, intuitive user interface, and customer experience.

Over time, he learned that this was the greatest strategy for launching a
cutting-edge business, cultivating a healthy corporate culture, and creating
distinct competitive advantages for the company.

However, he placed design first.

Design was the corporate strategy, the product strategy, and the service
strategy. It was unique because no company had ever adopted this design
approach before. Customer delight was also an important factor and to ensure
quality service was provided, Apple launched the Apple store which was
exclusively dedicated to the sales and service of Apple products. This created
brand recognition and more importantly established brand loyalty.

**9\. Don’t Be Afraid To Cannibalize Your Products**

The remark _“If you don’t cannibalise yourself, someone else will”_ is one of
my favourites from Steve Jobs. Cannibalizing is today’s version of ongoing
innovation, which is why it’s so important.

To remain relevant, you must make sure your product is constantly updated to
reflect changes in the market and advances in technology.

The history of the iPod and iPhone serves as a good illustration of this
point.

It was 2007 when this took place.

The number of iPods sold was soaring. The iPod’s revenue had tripled since its
introduction in 2001, and the company’s profit margins were at roughly 40% at
that time. Apple derived half of its overall revenue in 2006 from iPod sales
and related services. Although the iPod was a commercial success, Steve Jobs
introduced the iPhone in 2007, fully expecting it to make the iPod obsolete.

To put this in perspective: from 2006 and 2014, Apple’s sales increased
from$19.3B to $182.8B.

Is disrupting **a product that generated 50% of your income** and was still
growing a risky move for you? Yes, absolutely! It was also a hazardous move
for Apple because it wasn’t in the cell phone business before this.

But before anyone else could take advantage of the opportunity, Jobs
cannibalized his product.

Job’s legacy is intertwined with his sense of aesthetics and desire for design
perfection.

There were a few qualities that set him apart from the rest, including his
keen eye for beauty, willingness to try new things and learn from failures,
and the capacity to create works of art that were nothing short of masterful.

[Patrick Campbell](https://x.com/Patticus) sold his startup, Profitwell, for
$200 million last year — and it was entirely bootstrapped.

Since then he’s started sharing a lot of primary research he’s commissioned
into topics that there isn’t a lot of ground truth data on. Most recently, he
shared his [competitive research
playbook](https://patticus.com/2023/12/16/competitive-research-playbook/) and
shared this framework — the market command matrix:

The y-axis represents how much of a competitor’s resources they’re piling into
your market, and the x-axis represents how aware customers in your market are
of the competitor.

The big text in each quadrant is what you should do in response. While the
placements on the matrix aren’t exact (for example a “big VC bet” could have
dramatically more or less mindshare depending on what stage they’re in),
Patrick’s recommendations are good.

Note that he only recommends you take action against the two quadrants on the
right — the competitors who your target and/or existing customers are likely
to be aware of.

Another note: “all-out attack” may mean exploring partnerships when you both
have leverage in different parts of the market — it doesn’t mean burning all
your money on paid ads.

He also includes free playbooks on how to handle competitors in each quadrant
— the [full article](https://patticus.com/2023/12/16/competitive-research-
playbook/) is worth a read.

I was chatting with an angel investor recently — someone just getting started
in the ecosystem. He told me about a startup that went viral with its launch
video, gained thousands of signups overnight, and now he was seriously
considering investing.

I paused him right there.

“Not every form of traction is real traction,” I said.

That one sentence sparked a much longer conversation. Because the truth is, _a
lot_ of early investors — especially those new to the game — get swept up by
flashy numbers that don’t tell the full story.

Even experienced operators can fall for surface-level traction if they don’t
dig deeper.

So I decided to write this — a quick breakdown of six common vanity metrics
that often show up in pitch decks, headlines, and investor updates… and what
you should actually be looking for instead.

Founders, this is for you too — if you want to earn real conviction from smart
investors, focus on these meaningful signals over the hype.

**1\. The Viral Launch Trap**

A product video goes viral. The team celebrates. There are thousands of
signups overnight. But how many of those people actually use the product? And
more importantly — how many pay?

Virality fades. What matters more is whether people stick around.

Look for:

  * Daily and weekly active users (DAU/WAU)

  * Retention curves over 30, 60, 90 days

  * Signs that users are getting real value

**2\. Revenue That’s Not Built to Last**

Early revenue is great. But be cautious when it's coming from one-off channels
like:

Short-term sales don't guarantee long-term growth.

Look for:

**3\. The Inflated Waitlist**

A startup brags about a 5,000-person waitlist. Sounds great, right? Not if it
came from giveaways or low-effort campaigns that don’t reflect real demand.

What actually matters:

  * How many waitlisted users convert into active customers

  * How fast that conversion happens

  * The cost of acquiring those leads

Small but high-intent lists are far more telling than big vanity ones.

**4\. Niche but Not Needed**

Sometimes, a startup has a tiny group of die-hard fans. They love the product.
They talk about it constantly.

But that doesn’t mean there’s a real market. It might just mean the product
fits one very specific use case or a hobbyist niche.

Look for:

  * Signs of the product gaining traction outside the founder’s immediate circle

  * Customer feedback from new segments

  * Growth that isn’t overly dependent on high-touch onboarding

**5\. The Corporate Pilot Illusion**

Enterprise startups often highlight pilots with major brands. It signals
hustle — but not necessarily product-market fit. Big companies run pilots all
the time, and many never turn into contracts.

Dig deeper:

  * How many pilots turned into paying customers?

  * Are customers renewing or expanding usage?

  * Is deal size growing over time?

These are signs that the product is becoming embedded in real workflows.

**6\. Fundraising ≠ Traction**

Raising from tier-one VCs is an accomplishment. But it’s not the same as
building something people love.

Some teams are simply excellent at storytelling and pitching. That’s not a bad
thing — but it doesn’t always reflect customer demand.

What to focus on instead:

  * Strong engagement and retention

  * Organic referrals from customers

  * Signs of word-of-mouth growth

As investors, we need to look past the surface-level excitement. Ask better
questions. Get curious about retention. Look closely at user behavior.
Understand where the growth is actually coming from.

And don’t hesitate to gut-check things with other experienced investors.

The best startups often grow quietly at first — but the signals are always
there if you know where to look.
