##### **📜 TODAY’S DEEP DIVE**

“We review countless pitch decks from founders every day, and yet over 95% of
them fall short on the most critical part: the problem slide,” shared a Pre-
Seed/Seed stage VC partner.

He shared -

“Throw half a dozen entrepreneurs in a room together with a whiteboard, and
they’ll be able to come up with a thousand business ideas in a couple of
hours. It’s the nature of entrepreneurship. Our brains are wired to keep an
eye on what could be better and how that gap in the market can be turned into
an opportunity. In other words: Ideas are cheap, and nothing is so awesome
that it couldn’t possibly be improved.

However, not all problems are worth solving.

There are two common problems with the problem slide. Some founders are
tempted to go way into the weeds on this slide, explaining the competitive
landscape, market size, customer segments, value propositions and more. I
understand the temptation — the problem formulation does touch a large number
of aspects of the business — but this is neither the time nor the place.

The other common issue I see in pitch decks is the absence of a problem slide.
This happens particularly often with founders who believe that their solution
and product slides are so good that the problem itself is obvious and a slide
talking about it is redundant. That is a mistake. Even if the problem is
universally understood, it’s helpful to see how a founder frames the problem.
There are some elegant ways of doing that.

Being able to clearly outline the problem is a crucial first step toward
explaining why people might want a solution. Explaining succinctly and clearly
what the problem is can be surprisingly hard for some companies, while others
have a much easier path toward a problem statement.

A few examples:

  * Internet connectivity is poor in many parts of the world. (Solution: Iridium’s satellite hotspot.)

  * Satellites, once launched into space, are either stuck in their predefined orbits or need to bring complex propulsion systems and fuel with them. (Solution: Atomos space tug boats.)

  * Training staff is hard and expensive to do consistently. (Solution: Gemba’s VR training platform.)

  * Limited access to personalized and contextual language learning (Solution: Duolingo - AI-powered language learning app with personalized lessons)

Now, we can argue about what the market size, customer segment and sensibility
of each of these problems are, but all of the above are real problems that
companies are working to solve.

However you choose to frame the problem statement, the issue you are
addressing is being experienced by someone, and it helps to explain to your
investors how you are thinking about your user base.

Heads up: Don’t go too far into the weeds here; if you need to break down
several different customer segments, that might be what a user persona or a
customer archetype slide is for. If you feel the desire to hold up the lens of
marketing, then your go-to-market slide is the right place for that. In broad
strokes, however, you’ll want to give your investors an overview of what
you’re doing here.

You can tell this story by using a single example: “Linda often works on the
road but can’t always get reliable internet.” Or by hinting at the market
size: “20% of all work-from-home workers lose productivity due to unreliable
internet.” What direction you choose depends on how you tell your overall
story; some narratives work better with a single example that follows the
story of the startup you’re raising money for from slide to slide.

A startup rarely comes across a real problem that people aren’t currently
solving in any way. Whenever I’m presented with “people aren’t currently
solving this because there is no solution” in a pitch deck, that’s an enormous
red flag. If people aren’t experiencing enough pain to solve the problem, why
would they start solving it now?

For the smart mug Ember, for example, the problem might be “My coffee goes
cold when I’m working.” There’s an existing solution: Make new coffee or put
your cup in the microwave for a few minutes. The former takes a few minutes
and is wasteful with your coffee. The latter takes a minute but may ruin your
flow of work.

Here, we can argue whether anyone truly needs an electric coffee mug (I have
one, I use it every day and I love it, but I’m a particularly gear-forward
nerdy weirdo), but the point is: Ember can point to a problem that many people
are experiencing and have existing solutions for. The question becomes “Is
Ember’s solution sufficiently better than the existing solution that people
are willing to pay $130 to not have to stumble over to the microwave every
couple of hours?” That’s a market sizing and go-to-market question; don’t
waste your time with that on this slide — that’s a different part of your
narrative.

Assuming you found customers who have a current solution to a problem, you can
discover what they are currently willing to sacrifice to “solve” their
problem. Some problems are solved with money. Others are solved with time.
Others again are solved with inconvenience or suffering the pain without
solving the problem.

Imagine having to send a letter. The solution to writing an address on the
envelope is simple: You use a pen.

Now imagine having to send 30 letters. You could use a pen, but now you might
want to load your envelopes into a printer instead and use a mail merge
software package to print each of the envelopes.

Now imagine having to send a hundred letters. Perhaps a label printer starts
to make more sense because envelopes jam in home printers frustratingly often.

Ten thousand letters? Forget about it — it’s time to start outsourcing and
using a direct mail provider. That is a huge financial outlay, but letting
machines take care of the printing and shipping makes more sense than stuffing
envelopes by hand.

The opportunity for a startup is solving a problem in a way that is — in one
dimension or another — better than the existing solutions. That doesn’t
necessarily have to mean that it has to be cheaper or even faster smaller or
more convenient than the existing solutions, but it has to be more “right” for
the target audience than their current options.

User research is an essential part of your customer discovery journey. Talking
to a lot of different customers about how they solve particular problems is
helpful.

Imagine the “problem” you are solving is that offices look sad and lifeless.
The solution you’ve come up with is an elegant way of hydroponically growing
plants in a way that looks beautiful and needs very little maintenance. To
figure out if that even makes sense, you need to learn a lot about how offices
currently deal with plants.

Some offices have an office manager who buys plants and sometimes waters them.
That only works if they remember to water the plants and know enough about
plants to choose the right ones based on the temperature and lighting in the
office building. Some offices are effectively “renting” the plants, and the
service contract comes with someone who looks after them. Other offices may
have landscapers on staff. Some might decide to order posters with photos of
plants or use silk or plastic plants.

All of these solutions have their pros and cons; price, convenience,
longevity, sustainability, etc. Be aware of all of them, and perhaps highlight
the one that is most relevant to your value proposition. Careful, though,
again: Your full competitive breakdown goes on the competition slide. Your
full differentiated market segmentation goes on the go-to-market slide. And if
you have a distinct value proposition, well, you can break that off onto a
separate slide, too.

In the context of fundraising, remember that a feature is not a product. You
may create a tool to help people write canned responses to their emails. “Tom
sends 900 emails per day, and he finds that he is often saying the same things
again and again. He is copying and pasting snippets of text from a Word
document he created, but that’s not efficient.”

On the face of it, that’s a real problem worth solving. But is Tom willing to
pay for it? Creating it as a standalone company might make sense. Still, it is
hard to imagine it being a billion-dollar company. If you get successful
enough, other companies will launch templating systems for an email in their
core offering. At that point, your business will become irrelevant overnight.
To wit, Gmail has templates built-in, and most customer relationship
management (CRM) software has snippets and templates built-in, too.

When telling the story of the problem, it’s helpful to have some examples of
how people are currently solving the problem: “Company X had to hire four
full-time staff and buy $50,000 of telecoms equipment to set up their SMS
infrastructure” is a great way to bring Twilio to life.

“For your web shop, the running of server hardware is painful and
unpredictable. If you have a sudden spike in traffic, it can take weeks to get
extra capacity, and you might lose millions of dollars as the web pages are
unavailable,” is a compelling argument for Amazon Web Services (AWS).

“Linda needs to hire an assistant to deal with her workload” is an excellent
argument for automatic account reconciliation and reminder-sending software
solutions.

Your job as the founder is to draw a solid, realistic picture of the problem
you’re about to solve, explain the pressing need people have for addressing
the issue and give an indication of how prevalent the problem is.

Don’t forget to include the risks or costs of what happens if the question
remains unsolved. If your “problem slide” ticks all of those boxes, you’re on
the right path.”

##### **📃 QUICK DIVES**

**[Andreessen famously
said](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part9.html) ,** “If you don’t
have anyone on your founding team who is capable of being CEO, then sell your
company.”

It’s true early on — having a “professional CEO” is a bad idea. They won’t
have as much skin in the game as a founder. There’s a reason founder-led
companies grow faster.

With that said, it isn’t true forever.

Speed is your biggest advantage early in your startup’s journey, but the delta
between its importance and the importance of other things like..

At some point, you need to expand your skillset and evolve from “founder” to
“CEO,” and not every founder pulls it off.

Even if you’re not the CEO, your actual responsibilities will naturally change
as the team expands from under 10 to over 100 or 1,000. But how do you know
when it’s time (if ever)?

Anand Sanwal, the co-founder and former CEO of CB Insights, **[created a
framework to
help](https://x.com/asanwal/status/1797798028977336653/photo/1)**.

Consider how excited you are about the company’s future and how equipped you
are to execute it. These are variants on skill vs will or attitude vs aptitude
frameworks if you've seen those

If you fall into quadrant 3 (above), it may be time to consider stepping
aside. Cuz sometimes, "different wars need different generals".

Most investment firms chase popular narratives. Bedrock does the opposite.

Rather than chase popular narratives,[ Bedrock’s
approach](https://bedrockcap.com/) is to invest when companies are incongruent
with the narrative. Simply put, search for narrative violations, which is
contrarian to most investment strategies. Let’s look into how Bedrock used
this strategy to find billion-dollar companies.

> Narrative violations are some of the best investment chances in technology
> today. These companies either stand out as unique or challenge what most
> investors think is possible.

Here are some examples:

  * **SpaceX** : Founders Fund invested after a rocket failure, while many thought the company was doomed.

  * **Skype** : Andreessen Horowitz invested when others believed Skype was failing.

  * **Lyft** : In 2012, people thought Uber would crush Lyft, but Lyft’s innovative approach proved strong.

Investing in ideas that contradict popular beliefs can feel lonely for both
investors and entrepreneurs. These companies often struggle to get attention
and lack the buzz that comes with more conventional opportunities. However,
this obscurity can protect them from competition and underestimation by
investors.

**When to Invest:** Bedrock believes the best time to invest is when a company
is most at odds with popular beliefs. Here’s a table showing notable narrative
violations over the years:

**How to Spot Violations** : Narrative violations are highly idiosyncratic, so
unearthing them is admittedly more art than science.

  * One starting point is to identify categories that were narratively hot for investors in the past but that most have cooled on today.

  * Another starting point is to search for companies that cannot be easily categorized at all. Is Vercel like AWS, Cloudflare, or MongoDB? Perhaps it’s simply one-of-a-kind.

  * On rare occasions, an entirely new category emerges that offers particularly fertile ground for narrative violations. Today, it may be decentralized apps and protocols.

**Avoiding Narrative Traps** : While narratives can inspire us and create
connections, they can also limit our thinking. In Silicon Valley, both outside
narratives and internal beliefs can narrow the focus on what’s popular. This
fixation risks missing out on groundbreaking ideas that could change
industries.

By looking for entrepreneurs who challenge these narratives today, investors
can back some billion-dollar companies.

[The Psych Framework](https://andrewchen.com/psychd-funnel-conversion/) tries
to help you map it throughout a user journey by framing moments in the journey
as either increasing or decreasing motivation and assigning points to each
moment. The main principles are:

  1. Every element on a page adds or subtracts emotional energy ("Psych").

  2. Inspiring users is as important as reducing friction.

For example, asking a user to enter information manually will decrease future
motivation — you’re “spending” your site’s mental capital with the user to get
them to perform that action.

While the actual point values that an action increases or decreases motivation
by are likely to vary from user to user, using the framework is a good
reminder that you can’t ask for too much from users — you have to give as
well, to keep them excited.
