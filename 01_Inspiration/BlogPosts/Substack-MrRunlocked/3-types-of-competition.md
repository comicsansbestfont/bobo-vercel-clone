The responses I get asking founders about ‘What’s your competition?’ are
mostly about direct competition. About companies that are building a solution
that’s very similar to their solution.

But it’s important to know, that most early-stage startups are NOT losing
deals to competitors. Most of the time, prospects don’t actively take a
decision and stick to the status quo or they decide on an alternative solution
to fix the problem.

So when talking about competition, it makes sense to differentiate between:

  1. Direct Competition

  2. Status Quo (not taking a decision)

  3. Alternative solutions

So think about competition in a holistic way. The objective of your prospects
is to fix their problem.

And normally there are multiple ways to fix the problem.

Let’s imagine a company raised €5 million and now has 15 open jobs. So far
they used a Excel spreadsheet to keep track of applicants. Hiring is slow and
it’s hard for them to find the right talent and keep track of the applicants.

But the topic is really important for them, because not fixing it (not hiring
people) has a massive impact on the future success of the company. A delay of
3 months in hiring the right salesperson can mean not hitting the revenue
goal, which means having a hard time raising the next round, which could lead
to running out of money etc…you get the point (it’s called the negative
implications).

And now the company has multiple ways to fix it. They can go for recruiting
software (like [join.com](https://join.com/de)) or direct competitors like
[softgarden](https://softgarden.com/), [recruitee](https://recruitee.com/de)
or [personio](https://www.personio.de/). But they can also hire a recruiting
agency to do it for them, increase the recruiting budget and give it to
Linkedin…or stick to using Excel as their ‘applicant tracking tool’.

So now imagine you are [join.com](http://join.com) and want to pitch your
solution to the Head of HR. It’s not about being better than the direct
competitors and showing all the crazy features you build (which others don’t).
First and foremost you need to beat the status quo and make them move and take
a decision that your promised land is better than the (shitty) status quo.

So when it comes to your positioning, don’t just look ‘within’ your direct
competition landscape - know how you position yourself also against
alternative solutions.

‘Competitive Alternatives’ is a term I heard first by [April
Dunford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdjlCLb9Hl8&ab_channel=Lenny%27sPodcast).

> She recommend to ask yourself ‘What would a customer do if your offering
> didn’t exist?’

The answers to this question give you a great shortlist of your ‘competitors’.
Most probably this shortlist consists of 1-2 direct competitors, 1-2 ‘old-
fashioned’ market leader software, and 1-2 alternative ways to fix the problem
(like Excel, manual work, agencies…).

So now when you’re working on your [SaaS
positioning](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-
positioning-6-different-ways), build clusters/buckets and think about how
you’re different from them.

This way when you talk to prospects and need to communicate how you are
different from your competition, it’s easy for you (without getting into
feature battles or talking negatively about them). A good way to follow is:

💡 If you value X, then Y is a good solution. But if you care about Z, then we
are the best product for you.

This could sound like the following:

👉 If you are a professional designer and your main job is to create visuals,
then Adobe is the perfect solution for you. But if you can’t spend the whole
day creating visuals (like marketing teams, early-stage founders etc.), but
still care about nice designs, then
[Canva](http://partner.canva.com/alexnotion) is the best product for you. And
if you just need nice visuals from time to time and want the best quality,
hiring a freelance designer is the best solution.

👉 If you have a big sales team (50+) and complex sales processes, then
Salesforce is a great fit. But if your sales team is rather small and you care
about an easy-to-manage CRM, then Pipedrive is your product.

👉 If you only need a simple 1-page website, [carrd.co](https://carrd.co/) is a
good solution. But if you care about design and code quality, then
[Webflow](https://webflow.grsm.io/04lglj9kxh6d) is your scalable solution.

👉 If you only have internal meetings with your teams, sharing your Google
calendar to find the best meeting dates is awesome. But if you have a lot of
meetings with ‘externals’ and don’t want to spend hours on finding appropriate
dates, [calendly](https://calendly.grsm.io/notion) is your go-to solution. If
you are super busy and don’t want to take control of your schedule,
outsourcing it to a virtual assistant is your best solution.

👉 If you are a city or municipality that only has a few resources to manage
and these can’t be booked by externals, managing them in Outlook is a good
way. But if you have 5+ public resources to manage and they are accessible to
the public (paid bookings), [Locaboo](https://www.locaboo.com/) is the best
solution.

Now once you have these ‘competition buckets’ it’s way easier for you to
create a powerful message about how you are unique and the best solution for
your ICP.

Referrals are step 5 of a successful [SaaS Growth Flywheel (AARRR
funnel)](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/5-steps-to-master-your-
saas-growth).

And ultimately there are 2 main sources on how to get referrals in your
flywheel:

The beauty of referrals is that it’s cheaper and more effective than acquiring
completely new customers. When your existing customers refer others to you
(for free or for a small referral bonus) they mostly refer peers to you, which
means they fit your [ideal customer
profile](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-powerful-
ideal-customer?s=w). Referred leads normally have a higher trust in your
business, belong to your ICP, and therefore also show higher conversion rates.

A great way to get exposure to your referral program is a page inside your
product.

Referral program page

Of course, the in-product page of the referral program is just one channel to
promote the program. Sending out emails to your happy customers or having
phone calls (sales or customer success) can work as well.

A lot of SaaS founders have the same challenge. They’re a solution on the hunt
for a problem.

“What can I make?” and “What would I  to make?” are the **worst** places to
start when considering what SaaS to build.

If you start from this place of self-service, you’ll have to be the luckiest
person (or team) alive to accidentally hit on a solution to a problem that a
load of other people will pay to have solved.

You need to find a problem worth solving. This is our tried and tested three-
step process:

  1. **Build a list of ideas.**

Every time an idea pops into your head, add it to the list. They’ll mostly all
be terrible. Our list is called ‘The List of Mostly Bad Ideas’.

  2. **Collect critical info for each idea.**

     1. What pain(s) it solves

     2. Who needs this solution

     3. What the estimated market size is (TAM)

     4. Who else is doing it

     5. Is the market saturated

     6. Could we _really_ be better / different

     7. Can we be passionate about it?

     8. Do we have any moral objections

  3. **Collect customer feedback.**

This is the critical bit. Get on Linkedin and find people who fit into the
target audience for your product idea and pitch it to them, as if you had
already made it. Ask them what they think, see if they would pay for it, see
if it solves the right problems.

When we do this, we roll the feedback from each ‘interview’ into the next
interview until the people we are talking to want to buy the product as if we
had it now. When we hear ‘I need this now and I’m sad I can’t have it now”
from a bunch of different people, you have a winner.

The best part, this takes very little effort. You could spend a year building
a product and then see if anyone wants it, or you could spend three days
getting people to tell you exactly what they want before you even start.
