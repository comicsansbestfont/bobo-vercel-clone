In the early days of (B2B) SaaS, most companies followed a traditional sales-
led growth approach. Nowadays in 2022 product-led growth seems to be the holy
grail for most startups.

But both strategies - product-led vs. sales-led - are valuable and don’t
exclude each other, most successful companies rely on both at the same time.
Implemented the right way it can accelerate your SaaS growth.

The decision if you should follow a product-led growth vs. sales-led growth
vs. hybrid model (combination of both) is based on:

  * how your customers actually want to buy your product (not what you personally prefer)

  * the complexity of your product // how easy can you deliver the value 

  * the complexity and length of the buying process

  * the price point of your product

The more complex the product, the longer the sales cycle, and the more
expensive your product, the better is a sales-led strategy for you (and vice-
versa).

Product-led growth means that your company's growth relies solely on product
usage (how your customers experience and interact with your product, including
acquisition, activation & retention). This means no sales touch is involved
and in-product features/experiences (e.g. share, invite, collaborate...) are
the main drivers for growth.

The user is led to the aha moment (meaningful experience with your product) in
a self-service way (no interaction with sales).

Product-led growth is ideal (and therefore also mostly used) for products that
are not too complex and have an easy buying process. Product-led is also
rather rare for products in the enterprise market. Most product-led products
are self-service products in the SMB and mid-market.

Examples of product-led growth products:

  * designing a new website (and then pay to publish the website to your domain) - [Webflow](https://webflow.grsm.io/notion)

  * sending chat messages to friends/colleagues (and then pay for unlimited messages & storage) - [Slack](https://slack.com/)

  * creating first notes and databases (and pay for team workspaces) - [Notion](http://www.notion.so)

  * sending your first email campaign/ newsletter (and pay for more contacts) - [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)

  * hosting a first online meeting (and pay for longer meetings) - [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)

Sales-led is rather the traditional way to sell software, but it’s still alive
and very much valuable for longer sales cycles, complex products, or when your
target audience wants it.

While product-led means that potential customers don’t need any interaction
with sales to get started with your product, sales-led growth puts human
interaction at the center. This means that your potential customers can only
purchase your product and use it after human interaction with your company
(mostly with the sales team).

While in product-led ventures ‘free trial’ or ‘get started’ are the dominant
call-to-actions, in sales-driven organizations ‘request a demo’ or ‘talk to
sales’ are dominant. The objective is to have a conversation with the
potential customer, and show them the value of the product in sales
meetings/demos with a value-based selling approach (not selling features).

The users can mostly (only) interact with the (full) product after they had
one (or more) sales meetings and signed the contract. And then a dedicated
account manager or customer success manager helps you with the implementation
and go-live.

To launch and grow your business it’s recommended to focus on one of the
strategies (product-led or sales-led). But over time it makes sense to invest
in both strategies and run a hybrid model.

The hybrid model means that both strategies are used in parallel. As said
above, product-led and sales-led do not exclude each other, they can work well
together.

Running a hybrid model makes sense if you start to expand your business
upmarket (begin to hunt bigger accounts) or downmarket (expand to hunt smaller
accounts).

Here is how most (successful) startups use both strategies in parallel:

  * They offer different experiences based on the customer profile (e.g. sales-led for enterprise customers vs. product-led for SMB customers). This means:

    * having 2 types of call to actions buttons on the website for specific customer profiles

    * asking segmentation questions in the product onboarding and offer based on that specific onboarding journeys

    * offering different levels of support & guidance

  * They use both strategies at different stages in the customer journey. Mostly, if new users show a specific activity in the product, they become qualified and get approached by sales (sales-qualified leads SQLs or product-qualified leads PQL).

In those cases product-led and sales-led work hand in hand. But make sure that
you define the customer journey well in advance.

In the following, I will share with you what’s vital for both strategies
(especially for product-led growth).

In case you want some more detailed information on one or more of them, please
let me know and send me a message.

If you currently purely focus on product-led growth, start to slowly add sales
activities to your growth strategy (especially if you want to expand
upmarket). This could involve the following steps:

  1. start to upsell your existing customers:

     1. upselling to a higher tier

     2. upselling to an annual contract

     3. upselling or expansion to a new product

  2. add first sales activities in your funnel:

     1. offer demos to SQLs

     2. outreach to A-leads and offer them extra support

     3. offer new sign-ups a premium onboarding

     4. call promising leads and follow up with them

  3. add outbound sales activities to your growth strategy

Think of ways how your potential customers can explore your product and
experience value already early in the customer journey without any human
interaction. Depending on your product, this could mean:

  1. offering more free available product information (e.g. demo videos, product webinars, test environments...)

  2. offering free trials of your product

  3. offering a semi-automated self-service onboarding

  4. offering a no-touch self-service onboarding experience (for specific customer segments)

For tip #1 and tip #2: Always master one strategy first before you add the
other one.

When you follow a product-led self-service growth, your goal needs to be to
get new signups to the desired behavior (aha-moment) as fast as possible. This
means first of all that you need to know what’s the aha-moment of your product
(that’s when new users experience the value of your product).

When you know the aha-moment, you can start to design a powerful onboarding
experience around it. The onboarding needs to be:

  * easy to understand (e.g. use product tours, academy videos, in-product messages, checklists & triggered emails...)

  * focused on delivering value to the user fast

  * divided into smaller actions to ensure fast achievements (e.g. progress bars, checklists...)

Once new sign-ups experience the value of your product, they are ready to
purchase. Connect the value of your product with your [pricing
model.](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-pricing-strategy) It’s
best if you align the customers’ interest (receiving value from your product)
with your own interest (increasing revenue). Always remember: customers pay
for value, not for features.

So what you need to know is the right value-metric of your product (e.g.
#bookings; messages sent...) and design your pricing model based on it. This
means you are scaling your revenue with your value metric (e.g. more bookings
for your clients means paying more for your software = interests are aligned).

You should have a close eye on the conversions of your [SaaS
funnel](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/5-steps-to-master-your-
saas-growth?s=w).

For product-led growth, you should track:

Learn more about product-qualified leads in [Beginner's Guide to Product
Qualified Leads (PQL)](https://productled.com/blog/product-qualified-leads/).

For sales-led growth, you should track:

  * traffic to sign-up

  * sign-up to demo booked

  * demo to closed-won

It’s important to clearly define the different stages in your funnel
(especially what is an active user and what does paying customer mean).
Everyone in the company should have a similar understanding of your funnel and
its definitions.

Long sign-up forms and complicated steps to get started with your product are
conversion killers.

What’s the downside of just asking for the email address? So limit the
information asked in the sign-up process to a minimum and get rid of long
sign-up forms.

Try to collect more information about your potential customer later in the
customer journey or as part of the product usage.

Make the discovery of the product engaging and nudge users to do the desired
actions. Great methods to do so are product tours, checklists of specific to-
dos, and progress bars. Customers love to see their progress in the product.

If users don’t understand specific features or just don’t know how to use or
implement the product, you should offer users an easy way to find answers to
their questions (e.g. chatbot, support chat, help center, academy...).

Don’t try to overload new users with information. It’s key to give them the
right amount of information and the right time (contextual messaging). Define
the key actions users take in the customer journey (e.g. sign up, the first
activity in the product, aha moment reached, email opened...) and use them to
trigger valuable communication - always with a clear goal in mind (e.g. test
this specific feature, purchase the product, proceed with the checklist...).
