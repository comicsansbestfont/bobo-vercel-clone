If you want to grow your business and want your great product to be used by
lots of customers, you need to know how to sell your SaaS product. Great SaaS
products still need sales.

In this blog, I’ve put together 22 powerful SaaS sales tips that will help you
to master your B2B Sales and close more deals.

P.S. Even if the 22 tips are written for Sales in B2B SaaS, they can be
applied to more or less every sales organization.

A quid pro quo is super relevant in B2B Sales. Especially in the early stage
(if you try hard to close your first customers) or end of quarters (when sales
reps need to hit their targets) many startups offer massive discounts without
anything in return. It’s way better (and more convincing) if you always ask
for something in return. Here is an example: ‘I can offer you a 10% discount
for the first year in exchange for XYZ (e.g. long-term commitment, a case
study with you, being one of our first testimonials, for 3 intros to other
potential customers…).

The success rate of cold calls decreased over the last years to around 1-3%
(for booking an appointment). The reasons are low availability (voicemails)
and more and more people prefer written communication. But on the other hand,
depending on who you are targeting (and how they use phones in their daily
work), it can still be an effective [growth
channel](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-21-saas-gtm-channels). Important
for the success of your sales calls are:

  * Knowing your [ICP (ideal customer profile)](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile) and what they care about

  * Be on point and don’t steal their time (no one wants to listen to an unknown caller for hours)

  * Speak conversationally and not like a sales robot

  * Have a great [1-sentence value proposition](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/143567526/simple-value-proposition-template) ready

  * Prepare yourself mentally and be full of enthusiasm (you need to feel it)

  * Talk about them and not about you (how you can make their life easier)

  * Prepare for the call (quick research about the prospect) and have a great reason to call (e.g. a recent article about them; new funding; new hire…)

  * Have a clear call to action (e.g. schedule a sales demo meeting)

Most startup founders love the idea of having scalable customer acquisition
(sales and marketing strategies) in place straight from day one. They hope
they don't need to talk to the customers and spend time on manual work,
instead, they want nice paid ads on Google, Instagram, or Linkedin, plus a
nicely designed website with a self-service SaaS product without human
interaction.

While this is of course the desired strategy for startups who’ve found
product-market fit and want to scale, I would highly recommend starting manual
[hand recruiting your first paid customers by doing stuff that does NOT
scale](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-grow-
from-10-to-100-paying) (e.g. Outbound Sales, phone calls, emails, etc...).

Preferably you start with customers you already know personally or are within
your network. In case this is not working for you, I would suggest you start
manually outreaching your target customer.

Here are some potential strategies for you:

  * Direct Messages via Linkedin, Facebook, and Instagram (depending on your target customer)

  * Outbound Email (with some Email Sequences)

  * Outbound Phone Calls

  * Social Network Groups (e.g. Facebook Groups or LinkedIn Groups)

For all those methods it’s crucial to have a well-defined [ideal customer
profile](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-powerful-
ideal-customer) (ICP).

You as a founder need to figure out sales yourself. This means you should take
care of closing the first paying customers before you hire your first sales
rep - this is called founders-led sales.

Being the one who is outreaching to potential customers, doing the sales
demos, and even onboarding the first customers helps you to learn about your
target audience - especially about their pain points, objections, and the way
they talk (speaking the same language as your customers) and of course feature
requests.

All this helps you to build a better product for the right segment of the
market (your [ICP](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-
profile) and [positioning](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-
positioning-6-different-ways)) and to work on your sales narrative and value
proposition.

So as a founder (even if you are the technical founder) you need to work on
the basics of your sales strategy before you hire your first sales manager.
Once you know how to close deals, and you can not handle it anymore alone,
it’s time to hire your first reps.

No one really cares about your features. They want to know how you can make
their life easier, and what’s the value of your product for them. So you need
to transform your features into benefits. Demonstrate what are the benefits
for your customers if they use your product (your features).

In B2B SaaS the main value is mostly to _**increase revenue or reduce cost** ,
or **improve productivity**._

On top of that, your product will deliver different (functional vs. emotional
vs. social) values or results for your customers. Sell those results, not your
features.

If you are following [sales-led growth
strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-
saas-growth) (=getting your prospects on a sales meeting) and prospects get in
touch with you (e.g. contact form), being as quick as possible with your reply
really matters. It’s best to keep your response time for inbounds below 5
minutes. Why?

  * They will still remember who you are (maybe even still be on your website)

  * They will mostly also get in touch with your competitors, so being first is an advantage

  * You will reach them at a time they are available and think about your product

Also think about adding the option to book a call with your sales team, so
they do not need to wait for you to get in touch with them.

I would recommend you to track your key activities (emails sent, calls, sales
demos, closing calls, onboardings…) as well as know your sales funnel and
conversions (e.g. MQL to SQL or win rate after a demo). Only if you measure
your performance and know your metrics, you can take a conscious decision on
where you need improvements.

Even if you’ve achieved the first step to getting your customers to pay for
your product, you need to work hard on making them happy successful customers
- otherwise, they will churn (earlier than you imagine).

Implement a new stage in your CRM to track how many of your paying customers
are becoming successful customers. Clearly define what a successful customer
is (e.g. 100 messages sent, 3 integrations activated, 3000€ transaction
volume…).

Lots of sales reps, if they start working for an early-stage startup, don't
really understand the product and industry - which isn’t a problem. The
problem is if they are not willing to dive deep to understand the customers
and gain knowledge about the industry and build their own network. So once you
see a sign that they do not want to become industry experts, it’s a [clear
sign for you to search for a
replacement](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/7-bad-signs-of-a-
wrong-first-sales).

The ratio of talking to listening is important for the quality of your sales
meetings. Based on different research on sales conversations, top sales reps
talk less than 45% and listen more than 55% of the time to the customers.
Important is to actively listen (e.g. find information about their pains, as
well as objections and next steps) and ask open questions and the W questions.

In every customer interaction (e.g. cold call, sales demos, onboarding
training…) it’s important that you customize your sales pitch to the
individual customer. No one likes to be treated as a number. So do your
discovery and understand the specific situation of the company, the person you
are talking to, and of course their motivations, triggers, and real pain
points.

Discovery during your sales demos is key - listen carefully and note your
customers’ pain points.

A great discovery is a combination of asking the right questions (to find pain
points) and getting your prospects to confirm them. Only after a great
discovery, you can move on in your sales demo and present solutions on how you
can help them to solve their pain points and what’s in for them (the value,
ROI).

So don’t do one-size-fits-all demos.

Don’t sell your solutions before you know the problem (pain points) of your
customer and get them to confirm that they also have the problem. Take notes
and write them down in your CRM.

If you haven’t found them, continue with your discovery phase.

Once you found the real pain points, you can move on and present your solution
to them (and remember: talk values, not features).

You will never close a deal without a (real) pain point. Pain is the driver
why prospects are open to solutions and ultimately the reason why customers
will buy your product (or why you can close them). Your customers will hate
their pain points, but for you, they are also opportunities, because they tell
you exactly what your customers want most.

And it’s important that you don’t make assumptions about their pain points,
you need to identify the real pain points.

Ask open questions and lots of Why to get the real pain points. What is the
ultimate trigger?

**Example:** Getting from a weak pain point (intentions) to a strong actual
pain point.

> Customer: We (customer) need better automation for our CRM management.
>
> You: Sounds interesting. Why is this important for you?
>
> Customer: Because at the moment it takes a lot of time to manage our CRM.
>
> You: Okay I understand. Let me better understand what you mean by ‘a lot of
> time’?
>
> Customer: At the moment we have 5 employees who take care of CRM operation
> full time - this is of course way too much compared to our company size.
>
> You: Okay, I see. It’s really important for me to get the full picture. So,
> why exactly is this a problem for you?
>
> Customer: Well, honestly we need to reduce our overhead costs in order to
> grow more profitable and be able to raise new funding. We can’t afford to
> pay so much money just for CRM operations work. So, it would be better for
> our financials, if we could reduce the costs by 50% or more.
>
> You: This makes totally sense. What do you think your employees will say?
>
> Customer: That’s another great point. Honestly, those employees would love
> to spend their time and skills on actually closing more customers. They only
> took care of CRM operations because it was necessary.
>
> You: Got it. So let me summarize: The reason (pain) you are interested in
> our product is that you want to reduce the costs associated with CRM
> operations to improve your financials as well as use those resources to
> close more deals (more revenue). Can you confirm that?
>
> Customer: Yes, exactly.

You as a founder (or early employee) are so convinced about your product, that
you want to pitch all your cool features and give your prospects all the
information you have - BUT you will overwhelm them with information. So, only
communicate as much information as the prospects can consume and focus on
always highlighting the values, not the features.

Guiding your prospects through the whole customer journey is really important
- so be conscious about the next steps they need to achieve. But especially
for your sales meetings, being specific about the next steps and clearly
communicating them to your prospects, will have a massive impact on your win
rate. Ideally, you get them to confirm their next steps and expectations to
increase their commitment. Here is an example:

  * I will schedule a ‘closing call’ with you as a follow-up on the XYZ date

  * Additionally, I will send you the contract and onboarding information today via email

  * Additionally, I will add 3 testimonial and their case studies

  * In case you have any questions, you can send me an email anytime or call me via +49XXXXXXX

  * You will talk next week with your CTO about the API integration

  * Anything that I missed or can you confirm the next steps?

After every sales meeting make sure to follow up (via email & on time). A
great follow-up email includes:

  * short summary of sales call

  * including highlighting the value proposition and key results the product delivers for the customer

  * clear next step(s) (e.g. follow-up meeting scheduled on XYZ date)

  * personalized content (e.g. their specific pain points)

  * keep it short + easy to read (e.g. bullet points, marked bolded)

At the end of every sales conversation there is the moment where it’s getting
a bit nerve-wracking - can you actually close the deal?

If you have done a great discovery, found pain points (confirmed by the
customer), and shown the value of your product, and if you are confident that
your product is a good fit for your prospect, it's time to ask for the sale.

Even if they decide that they are not ready, or that the price is too
expensive, or they postpone their decision, it’s good that you’ve asked for
the sale. You can now ask ‘Why’ and learn what’s missing for them to take the
decision and tailor your follow-up based on that.

Don’t ask your prospect, if they want to move on (become a customer) or not?
It’s better to shift their attention to answering the question if they want
your basic plan or premium plan (and not if the product at all is right for
them).

Here are some great sales closing questions:

  1. Based on our conversation, it seems like (the premium plan) of our product is the best fit for you to solve your (main pain point). What do you think?

  2. Do you have any more questions or are you ready to move forward? I can send you the contract right away (and we go over it together).

  3. Based on your individual requirements and preferences, I believe our Product A and Product B are a great fit for you and your company. Do you prefer to go with Product A or Product B?

  4. It seems like our product is a perfect match for you. Is there any reason I should be aware, that you wouldn’t sign a contract with us?

Don’t read phone scripts, and don’t pitch your product like a robot. Of
course, you should prepare and make use of great templates, but still, make it
personal and human. So try to speak freely.

Positive side effect: When you speak freely you will talk slower which makes
it easier for your customer to follow you.

If you know the main objections of your customers and if you are well prepared
on how to overcome them, you will most likely close way more deals and see an
increase in your sales win rate.

The most common objections in B2B SaaS are ‘Your product is too expensive’ and
‘You are missing a specific feature that is important for us’ and ‘We can’t
make a decision right now’.

And here is how you should deal with them:

  * **Too expensive** —> Don’t give up on the deal and also don’t offer a discount, because you will lower the value of your product, in fact, you need to go back and present again the value of your product (as they haven’t understood the full value of your product).

  * **Missing feature** —> Don’t panic, rather ask questions about why they need this feature and what problem it solves for them. The chances are high, that your product can already solve the problem (sell the value again) or that the feature is coming soon.

  * **Can’t make a decision now** —> Again, dig deeper and understand what’s missing for them to take the decision. Is it because they are missing a feature or because the product is above their budget (see how to address those above)? What is the real reason that they can’t decide now? Mostly it means that they are not fully convinced yet.

How do you make sure that a prospect is a qualified customer and fits your
ICP?

Even if declining interested prospects sounds contra-productive for achieving
your goal to grow the business, it actually helps you to focus on the right
customers and double down on them.

I would highly recommend qualifying your prospects to make sure you only serve
the right ones. A good way to do so is to ask 3-5 qualifying questions -
depending on the answers you decide, if those are the right fit or not.

If you follow these sales tips you will quickly grow your business and close
more deals.
