Here's a hard truth that most founders and marketing leaders don't want to
hear:

_**“trying to sell to everyone who'll pay is the slowest path to 1€M, or at
least the slowest to 10€M ARR”**_

We know, We know. Your product could help so many different types of
companies. And turning down paying customers feels wrong, especially in the
early days.

But here's the thing: the fastest path to meaningful growth isn't casting a
wider net. It's going narrow and deep.

Think about it this way. Would you rather be:

1️⃣A small fish fighting for survival in a big pond (aka. your TAM)

or

2️⃣a big fish in a small pond (aka. dominating a sub-segment of your SOM)

The math is simple. Let's say you're targeting a 100M€ market.

  * If you capture 10% of a niche, that's 10M€.

  * If you try to capture 1% of a 1B€ market, that's also 10M€

But here's the kicker: capturing 10% of a focused market is WAY easier than
capturing 1% of a broad market.

Why? Because…

Serving multiple different segments at the same time is time and resource-
intensive.

Each customer segment you serve requires its own:

And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

Additionally, every time you add a new segment, you build a new GTM motion.

Each motion requires:

And guess what? Your small team can't execute multiple GTM motions
effectively. You'll end up doing everything poorly instead of one thing
exceptionally well.

Here's what happens when you chase every potential customer:

❌Marketing messages become generic and forgettable

❌Sales cycles get longer and more unpredictable

❌Product development gets pulled in multiple directions

❌Customer success becomes a constant firefight

❌Churn increases as you fail to deliver specific value

Neither fun, nor desirable.

The path to 1€ and then to 10€M ARR isn't about maximizing your total
addressable market.

It's about dominating a [specific
segment](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile).

When you focus on one specific segment:

✅Your marketing message becomes crystal clear

✅Your sales team becomes highly efficient

✅Your product roadmap gets laser-focused

✅Your customer success becomes predictable

✅Your referrals start flowing naturally

Most importantly, you build deep expertise in solving specific problems for
specific customers.

This expertise compounds over time, creating a moat that competitors can't
easily cross.

Which will ultimately bring you to the point of **[predictable& repeatable
growth](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-right-time-to-scale-your-saas)**.

Or as [Robert &
Anthony](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/heyrobk_productmarketfit-startups-
saas-
activity-7295815244847661056-SXCB?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
call it: **Product Market Fit**.

And once you ‘dominate’ this specific slice of the market. You have 2
expansion options:

1️⃣**Vertically** (same target audience (aka. ICP), but new use cases)

or

2️⃣**Horizontally**(same use case, but new target audiences)

But first, you need to prove you can win decisively in one space.

And this all starts with phase 1: The ‘hustle’ mode.

We call it the ‘hustle mode’ phase, others call it the ‘Market
experimentation’ phase.

Hustle mode is where you’re throwing everything at the wall to see what
sticks. You’re chasing your [first paying
customers](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/9-tactics-to-get-your-
first-50-customers), testing hypotheses, and figuring out who’s willing to
swipe their credit card.

And that’s fine. For a while.

At this stage, you’re not overanalyzing. You’re not building complex data
dashboards or running segmentation experiments. You’re just trying to get
customers in the door. It’s messy, it’s scrappy, and it’s necessary.

But here’s the thing: hustle mode should only last so long.

These initial customers are your ECPs (Early Customer Profile). They tend to
be rather:

✅[solution-aware](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/147302979/product-category-
awareness),

✅experimental,

✅and in the market.

They are most likely different from your [Ideal Customers
(ICPs)](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile) \-
your ultimate goal.

Your ICPs tend to be:

❌not yet solution aware,

❌require proof of work and

❌hard(er) to reach.

You can see the difference between [early customers & ideal
customers](https://knowledge.gtmstrategist.com/i/144667828/ecp-should-not-
just-happen-it-should-be-a-proxy-of-icp) in this visual.

Once you’ve landed your first 10-100 customers (depending on your ACV, more on
that below), it’s time to stop and think. And start analyzing.

Why?

Because not all customers are created equal. Some will be a great fit for your
product and vision; others will drain your resources and churn faster than you
can say “customer success.”

You need to refine your ECPs and work your way up to your ICP.

The sooner you identify the *right* customers, the sooner you can focus all
your energy - and budget - on pulling more of them in.

Timing matters.

You don’t want to start analyzing:

❌too early: not enough data

or

❌too late: you’ve already wasted resources on bad-fit customers

The right time depends on your target audience and average contract value
(ACV):

Selling to:

1️⃣**Enterprise with a high ACV of 100k€+:**

Start analyzing after 5-ish customers. Truth is, you’re not going to have very
many €100K+ ACV won deals, so you’re left to make assumptions with a low
sample size.

2️⃣**Mid-Market with ACVs from 25-100€K-ish:**

Aim for 25 customers before diving into analysis.

3️⃣**SMB Market with ACVs from 5-25k€:**

Aim for around 100 customers

4️⃣**Prosumer / small businesses with ACVs up to 5k€:**

You should have min. 100 customers

The more data the merrier, a sample size of 100 becomes statistically
relevant.

💡Good Reminder: [5 ways to build a 100€ million ARR SaaS
business](https://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2019/04/five-years-later-five-
ways-to-build-100.html)

Just a heads up before we dive into the process.  

There is an art and a science to finding your ICP.

The art aspect refers to the qualitative components that go into the pot:

✅ past experience,

✅ intuition and

✅ personal preference (about the types of companies/people you want to serve)

These are important components and shouldn't be overlooked. When setting out
to do this, you’ll find yourself in one of three positions:

1️⃣You have a good idea of the types of businesses you need to be going after,
or you can narrow down your possible ICPs to two or three segments.  

This is especially true for large deal environments, where you have fewer
customers and so, less data. You may also be in this position if you’ve had
many customers already, but you’re pivoting and feel that data about your past
deals are not relevant.

2️⃣Other times, especially in high velocity and low ACV environments, you will
be sitting on a good amount of data, and everything we tell you about the
quantitative process below is a lot more relevant.

3️⃣Then, there is a third scenario in our experience.

A founder will have a good idea of their ICP in our initial conversation. Then
we look at more nuanced factors that go into shaping an [ideal customer
profile](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile) and
dive into the data. This almost always proves to be a super-valuable process,
because it refines and sometimes even overrides original assumptions and
changes the game.

The magic is in blending qualitative factors with the process and data while
knowing the limitations of each.  

Enjoy the ride!

Now that we know WHY and WHEN to analyze early customers, let’s jump into HOW
you work your way to your ICP.

To validate your ICP, you need to:

1️⃣Collect data of your customers

2️⃣Break down your customer base into segments and

3️⃣Analyze them against metrics that are indicators of ‘better fit’

We call them **‘‘better-fit’ Indicators (aka. Winning indicators)**.

Let’s dive into the step-by-step process.👇

To know which customers are a ‘better fit’, you need to search for ‘winning
indicators’.

We recommend looking for key indicators that signal those “best-fit” (aka.
ideal) customers.

  1. **Usage Intensity / Product Engagement Indicators**

     1. Frequency of key actions (e.g., daily/weekly logins; core product activities (emails sent, calls scheduled, data uploaded)

     2. Depth of feature adoption (using advanced vs basic features)

     3. Integration usage (API calls, 3rd-party app connections)

These customers actively use your product, not just sign up and ghost you.

  2. **Commercial Health Indicators**

     1. Higher Win Rates: Which segments convert more easily during sales conversations?

     2. Shorter Sales Cycles: Who closes faster? A shorter sales cycle often indicates a better fit.

     3. Higher ACVs: Are certain segments willing to pay more for your product?

     4. Actual Profit* = Revenue - Support Costs - Infrastructure Costs

     5. Expansion potential (upsell/cross-sell opportunities) / Net revenue expansion (NRR)

     6. Conversion Rates (e.g. Visitor to Demo)

     7. Customer Acquisition Costs (CACs)

     8. Payment reliability (days past due)

  3. **Strategic Alignment Indicators**

     1. Roadmap fit (do they need features you're excited to build?)

     2. Referenceability (their willingness to [case studies/testimonials](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/148579534/case-studies-how-to-get-a-great-case-study))

     3. Cultural fit (values alignment with your team. There might be verticals/user personas that are more pleasant to deal with than others.)

  4. **Customer Success Indicators**

     1. Higher NPS Score: Happy customers are sticky customers.

     2. Customer Support Data: Which customers require less hand-holding from your team?

     3. Better qualitative feedback: What do founders or sales reps notice about these accounts? Sometimes gut feeling matters.

* In case different segments have huge differences in support costs and infrastructure costs, think of analyzing actual profits.

Generally speaking, **your ‘best-fit’ customers:**

💪 have higher product engagement

💪 show better commercial metrics

💪 are less support intense

💪 are better aligned with your strategy and values/culture

Surprise, surprise: you’ll need data. Head over to the relevant systems (help
desk, CRM, product analytics, etc.) and collect as much information as
possible (ideally, export 12+ months of customer data).

Try to Include the following data points (non-exhaustive list):

  * Firmographics (industry, employee count, revenue, location)

  * Technographics (existing tech stack; previous solution)

  * Product usage data (login frequency, feature adoption, product usage metrics, etc.)

  * Sales data (sales cycle, lead source, deal value, etc.)

  * Persona data (champion role, decision-maker role)

  * Support (tickets, NPS, health score)

  * Payment processor/accounting (revenue, billing period, churn)

  * anything else that contains valuable information about customers

*Bonus: You can do the same exercise for all your open & closed deals (lost & won) to also get a picture of the lost deals.

Now you want to create core segment groups based on the criteria you deem are
the most important grouping criteria.

_Key Insight:_ These surface-level segments often reveal initial patterns -
but rarely the full picture.

Now you’ll want to go deeper than the above steps. Layer on advanced filters
that correlate with value.

Here’s a list of advanced filters (with a few examples) you could apply:

  1. **Vertical-specific**

     1. number of SKUs in e-commerce

     2. transaction volume for payment solutions

     3. leads contacted in the sales enablement market

     4. the marketing budget for a performance marketing solution

  2. **Use case (how they use your product)**

     1. Using ‘calendly’ for sales vs. recruiting

     2. Single ‘use-case’ users vs. ‘multi use-case’ users

  3. **User persona (who uses your product)**

     1. the manager vs an executive vs. Individual contributor?

     2. roles & titles (e.g. marketing vs. product people)

  4. **Customers’ main challenges/pain points**

     1. companies having hiring problems vs. the ones who have funding problems

     2. Reduce costs vs. growing faster

But in the end, this depends on your business. Every business has different
criteria that are relevant to segmenting its market.

You can mindmap your way to the variables that make a difference like we did,
below:

Now comes the fun part: digging into your data to find the gold nuggets (aka.
ideal customers). Segments that consistently outperform on your winning
indicators.

Once you’ve done the segmentation in Step 2 and Step 3 and know your winning
indicators (step 1), you want to analyze your segments against the ‘best-fit’
customer criteria.

This could look like the following:

(We recommend using Excel or GSheets.)

##### Example: Segmentation based on Industry

##### Example: Segmentation based on vertical-specific criteria (SKUs in
e-commerce)

_Pro Tip:_ Create a scoring matrix where each segment gets 1-5 points per
category, such as this:

If no segment stands out, either:

✅Wait for more data (if <100 customers) or

✅Re-examine your segmentation criteria  

Finding your ICP is just the beginning. The real work starts when you align
your entire [GTM strategy](https://alexestner.gumroad.com/l/saas-growth-
worksheet) around this segment.

And trust us, focusing on one segment (your new ICP), means saying NO to a lot
of things.

Focusing on your ‘new’ ICP means most probably making changes in your [GTM
strategy](https://alexestner.gumroad.com/l/saas-growth-worksheet).

✅Adapting your [positioning](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-
positioning-6-different-ways)?

✅Finetuning your [value
proposition](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/143567526/simple-value-proposition-
template)?

✅Change your [messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-
messaging-framework)?

✅Making changes to your [pricing](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-
ultimate-b2b-saas-pricing-guide)?

This includes things like updating your [website
copy](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/how-to-high-converting-saas-homepage),
[sales deck](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/high-converting-sales-deck), and
[LinkedIn profiles](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/founder-led-linkedin-guide).

Double down on the [growth
channels](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-21-saas-gtm-channels) where your
ICP hangs out.

For instance stronger focus on [LinkedIn
ads](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/how-to-get-started-with-linkedin) or
[Google Ads](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/google-ads-guide) or betting
stronger on [content](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-content-
marketing-guide) or [social content on
LinkedIn](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/founder-led-linkedin-guide)

Remember, you are moving from ‘hustle mode’ to ‘focus mode’ to reach Product-
Market Fit as soon as possible.

This is exactly what I did at Locaboo and Daniel at SalesAutopilot.

They served clients in different industries and also slightly different use
cases. Because of this, the positioning was very broad and GTM efforts were
not laser-focused on a clear ICP.

**1\. Segmentation by Industry**

The company served multiple industries and slightly different use cases. We
dig into the data to see that a specific segment outperformed the other
segments by far.

**2\. Further niching down within the industry (by size and use case)**

So we drilled down and added additional criteria.

✅amount of resources managed

✅the previously used solution,

✅size of company

✅and the primary use case

**3\. Identify winning segments**

So we analyzed the common characteristics.

We saw that a specific amount of ‘resources managed’ is a leading indicator
that the company is a good fit. They showed better metrics, including higher
win rates, ACVs, higher product adoption, and almost no churn.

**4\. Double Down & Revamping GTM**

After seeing clear winning segments, it was time to adapt the GTM for this
segment. Adapting positioning & messaging. Aligning pricing. Focus on relevant
growth channels.

All relevant GTM metrics increased including increasing win rates from 27% to
50% and increasing ACVs by 60%.

SalesAutopilot, a marketing automation platform, served SMBs across a bunch of
industries; brick-and-mortar, e-commerce, B2B, and info-marketers. The
challenge? They were spread too thin and needed to identify their most
profitable segment to focus on.

**1\. Segmentation by Industry**

We chose industries as the segmentation basis because each vertical had
distinct use cases. For example, e-commerce brands focused on cart
abandonment, while brick-and-mortar businesses used local promotions.

**2\. Look Beyond Revenue**

Revenue alone wasn’t enough. High-revenue segments consumed significant
resources—bandwidth, server costs, and customer support hours. With help from
the developers, we attributed these costs to each segment and calculated *true
profit*.

**3\. Identify winning segments**

E-commerce emerged as the most profitable segment. They engaged deeply with
the product, required less support, and were willing to pay for advanced
features.

**4\. Double Down & Revamping GTM**

We rebranded and built a promotion around e-commerce, revamped messaging for
their pain points, and adjusted pricing tiers. This meant alienating less
profitable segments—but it was worth it.

A 41% increase in monthly recurring revenue (MRR) post-rebrand. To be fair,
the results didn’t emerge BECAUSE OF segmentation. Rather, the segmentation
paved the way for a kick-ass campaign with messaging and vibe that truly
resonated with the most desirable target segment, e-com shops.

Validating your ICP isn’t just a marketing exercise. It is a huge, unavoidable
part of company strategy.

By focusing on the right customers, you simplify everything: messaging, sales
processes, product development, and even customer success efforts. You stop
burning resources on bad-fit accounts and start building momentum with a
segment that truly values what you offer.

So take the time to analyze your early customers now… it’ll save you years of
wasted effort later.

Remember: growth doesn’t come from trying to serve everyone; it comes from
serving *someone* better than anyone else can.

Pick your pond, dominate it, and grow from there.

**Happy growth 🚀**
