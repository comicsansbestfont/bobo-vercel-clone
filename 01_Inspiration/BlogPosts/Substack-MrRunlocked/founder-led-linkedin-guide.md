The best-performing companies on LinkedIn rely on a multidimensional content
strategy based on three key pillars:

  1. **Founder-Led Content** – The founder (or central executive) is positioned as the face of the brand.

  2. **Employee-Led Content** – Employees contribute to the narrative by sharing their insights.

  3. **Company Content** – The corporate page supports strategic goals through targeted content, such as case studies and company news.

Many companies invest heavily in their corporate LinkedIn page, only to be
disappointed by low engagement.

The reason is simple: 👉 People buy from people.

Even [TikTok’s CEO takes time to address trending industry
topics](https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok/video/7460937381265411370). In today’s
social media landscape, audiences crave authenticity, transparency, and
behind-the-scenes insights. The best companies embrace this shift and put
their leadership team front and center.

A Founder-Led LinkedIn strategy is a content and engagement approach in which
the company’s founder (or co-founder) actively **builds personal authority,
thought leadership, and brand visibility** rather than relying solely on the
company’s LinkedIn page.

**Personal Profiles > Company Profiles**

People engage with people, not logos.

By leveraging their personal brand, founders can:

✅ attract inbound opportunities,

✅ increase brand awareness,

✅ build trust,

✅ and position themselves as industry leaders.

This means LinkedIn thought leadership enables founders to build trust (at
scale) - especially important for early-stage founders who usually lack social
proof and brand trust at the beginning of their journey.

But let’s take a closer look at the advantages of LinkedIn thought leadership
for SaaS companies:

1️⃣ **Positioning in the Niche**

To be seen as an expert in your market segment, you need to establish a clear
and strategic position in your prospects' minds.

2️⃣ **Shortened Sales Cycles**

A strong LinkedIn presence builds trust long before your sales team reaches
out.

3️⃣ **Stronger Customer Retention**

Existing customers want to see you stay relevant and provide continuous value.

4️⃣ **Inbound Leads**

With the right content strategy, potential customers will reach out to you.

5️⃣ **Partnerships & PR**

Increased visibility leads to strategic collaborations and media
opportunities.

6️⃣ **Owning Your Audience**

Building your audience reduces dependency on paid ads and shifting platform
algorithms.

Let’s give you some examples of SaaS founders with great personal branding.

Adam Robinson is most probably one of the top examples of 2024. He got 21
million views on LinkedIn, growing his company to §$4M ARR. **But he also
spent 65% of his time on content work**.

**LinkedIn Post example**

**LinkedIn Post example**

He’s what we consider ‘building in public’ and sharing transparently his
journey.

But he also knows how to ‘entertain’ the audience. His most successful posts
are some very funny GIFs (but always greatly aligned with his overall
positioning ‘product analytics’).

**We asked Enzo about his best tips:**

**LinkedIn Post example**

But let’s also look at some ‘smaller’ accounts and see how they are doing it.👇

**We asked Eva Johanna about her best tips:**

**We asked Arnaud about his best tips:**

These founders don’t just post—they strategically engage and build ecosystems
around their expertise.

**👉 Hit ‘reply’ and share your best founder profiles.**

By now we know:

In the upcoming sections, we share with you step-by-step how you can become a
strong LinkedIn brand yourself.

A LinkedIn presence isn’t just about content—it’s a business decision with
clear goals. Your product or service should directly influence your content
themes.

So, before diving into LinkedIn content creation, get clarity on your Go-to-
market (GTM) foundations:

  1. [Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile) & Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD)

  2. [Positioning & Messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-framework)

If you haven’t clearly defined these yet, now is the time.

**Ask yourself:**

  * _What industry and product category does your solution belong to?_

  * _What usecase(s) do I need your product for? What core problem do you solve for your customers?_

  * _Who are your main customers and why?_

  * _What key KPIs does your product influence?_

  * _What are the benefits and results for your customers using your product?_

  * _How long does it typically take for your customers to see measurable results?_

  * _What is your most concise one-sentence pitch or value proposition?_

Your answers shape how you position yourself and your product, and what
content resonates best with your audience.

But let’s go through each of these step-by-step now.

A clearly defined [ICP](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-
customer-profile) allows you to create highly relevant content and meaningful
engagement - is the foundation that helps you in many ways on LinkedIn

Depending on your Go-To-Market (GTM) phase, you may have multiple ICPs, but
the goal is to prioritize one segment for focus.

Remember, a great ICP consists of:

1️⃣ Your Ideal Company (Firmographics)

2️⃣ Your Ideal Personas (User/Champion & Decision Maker)

3️⃣ Your Anti ICP

Feel free to use my [Ideal Customer
Profile](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile)
template for this 👇.

To write content that resonates with your ICP, clearly define your:

✅ market's pain points/challenges

✅ and your ICP's Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD)

✅ ’a day in the life of your customer’ including activities, responsibilities
& metrics
* * *

👉 _**Example: Product Description for a Project Management Tool**_

Job Titles/Roles:

  * Project Managers

  * Product Managers

  * Team Leads

  * Agile Coaches

  * Operations Managers

Company Size and Type:

  * Mid-sized to large enterprises (50-500 employees).

  * Tech startups, digital agencies, and IT consulting firms.

Industry Verticals:

  * Software Development

  * IT Consulting

  * Digital Agencies

JTBD

As a project manager, I want to…

  *  _Easily track project progress so that I can ensure deadlines are met._

  * _Automate repetitive tasks to free up time for strategic planning._

  * _Get real-time updates from my team so I can quickly resolve blockers._

Key Challenges/ Pain Points They Face:

  * _Lack of visibility into project progress—teams struggle to track deliverables and deadlines._

  * _Inefficient communication between teams—messages get lost across multiple platforms._

  * _Task overload and misalignment—team members get overwhelmed with unclear priorities._

  * _Difficulty managing remote and hybrid teams—lack of centralized collaboration._

  * _Bottlenecks in approval processes—delays due to slow decision-making._
* * *

💡 Tip: To identify your pain points in the market, a few ways to consider:

  1. Qualitative JTBD interviews with your ICP

  2. Call Recordings of your Discovery & Demo Calls

  3. Reading review platforms like G2 & Capterra

  4. Using AI-powered tools like Synthetic Users

  5. Use custom research prompts

Why should customers choose you over competitors? Your market positioning
determines your success on LinkedIn.

We recommend following 4 steps.

##### Step 1: Understand the current way of doing things (Status quo)

##### Step 2: Understand alternative options

##### Step 3: Choose your product category or use case

You as a founder need to make a crucial decision in terms of positioning.

**Usecase Positioning vs. Product Category Positioning**

In a nutshell, do this:

✅ Product Category positioning: if you’re building a product in an established
market

**→ Good indicator: you will find a category on G2, Capterra, etc. and there’s
existing search demand on Google & co.**

✅ Usecase positioning: you’re building a product in a rather new market (blue
ocean); no established product category has been built yet.

**→ Good indicator: No product category on G2, Capterra, etc.**

##### Step 4: Add your unique differentiation (positioning angle)

Now you need to add 1 or more of the [6 SaaS positioning
options](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/115580905/the-different-types-of-saas-
positioning).

1️⃣ **Niche down**

Finding an (underserved) segment of the market and building the best tool for
them.

Most of the time it's vertical-specific tools.

Examples: Resource management software for the public sector
([locaboo.com](https://www.locaboo.com/)) or banking account for freelancers
([kontist.com](https://kontist.com/))

**2️⃣ Low-cost player**

Mostly in a more crowded market when market leaders increase their prices (a
lot), you have the chance to build a low-cost version of it.

Best for PLG products.

Examples: [Breakcold](https://www.breakcold.com/?via=alexander25) or
[Clickup](https://clickup.com/pricing) \- Cheaper alternatives to market
leaders like Salesforce or Asana

**3️⃣ Premium-player**

Serve clients that need more human touch (customer service, sales demos...).
You can position yourself as the premium player. Mostly more connected to the
enterprise segment.

Examples: Salesforce or Adobe Creative Cloud

**4️⃣ Unique benefit**

You have something very unique that no one else has.

This can be a specific feature or the fact that you serve a specific market
better (e.g. being GDPR compliant, if you sell to DACH market)

Examples: [Cleverreach](https://www.cleverreach.com/) \- GDPR-compliant
alternative to Mailchimp

Some other examples are:

  * Proprietary Technology (e.g. AI-driven)

  * Special expertise (e.g. founded by ex-XX)

  * Better support (e.g. dedicated account manager 24/7)

  * Speed of delivery/implementation (e.g. Quick onboarding with pre-built project templates)

**5️⃣ Being the 'lite' version of something complex**

You serve a customer segment that doesn't need the heavy, complex market
leader (e.g. Salesforce or Adobe).

You're building a lightweight version.

Examples: [Pipedrive](https://www.pipedrive.com/) being the lite alternative
to Salesforce

**6️⃣ Mix of the above**

Of course, each of the elements can be mixed. Lite players, niche players, and
low-cost players work quite well hand in hand. Also niching down and having a
unique benefit can be very powerful.

Your differentiation should be subtly reflected in your content, reinforcing
why you’re the best choice in your space.

Storytelling has been an essential part of human communication for thousands
of years.

Your story isn’t just about what you do—it’s about why you do it and how it
connects with your audience.

Great stories follow a clear structure. They highlight the journey, the
challenges, and the transformation.

The founder brand is a concept by Dave Gerhardt.

👉 Here’s a great YouTube video about [Founder Brand
Creation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4LpPMR6v1E).

If you don’t want to watch the video, answer the questions below and build
your founder story 👇

  1. **What is the founder’s backstory?**

Your past experiences shape your brand. But you don’t need to list
everything—just the parts that directly connect to your product or mission.

  2. **What were you doing before you came up with the idea that sparked your business?**

Be honest and vulnerable—authenticity builds trust.

  3. **What is the problem?**

Every great business starts with a problem. Identify the pain point that led
to your solution.

  * Was it a product that didn’t exist, so you had to create it?

  * A service you needed but couldn’t find?

  * A widespread issue that nobody was solving effectively?

Clearly defining the problem makes your solution more compelling.

  4. **Who or what is the villain?**

Every story has an antagonist—something standing in the way of success.

  * Is it an inefficient industry norm?

  * A flawed system that frustrates users?

  * A gap in the market that no one noticed?

  * or simply an old/inefficient status quo of doing things?

Your audience needs to understand why this problem exists and why breaking
free from it matters.

  5. **What is the solution?**

Now, introduce your game-changing solution. But keep it simple.

How do you solve this problem?

  * What product do you offer?

  * How does it address the issue?

  * What are the key capabilities & features of your product?

Keep it concise, relatable, and outcome-driven.

  6. **What are the benefits & results?**

What’s in for your customers? (aka. benefits).

And what results can they expect using your product? Share numbers if
possible.

You can share functional, emotional & social benefits

  7. **What Does Life Look Like Before and After?**

One of the most effective ways to drive engagement is by painting a vivid
before-and-after picture.

A powerful transformation story makes your product feel irresistible.

**P.S.** Keep in mind, that it doesn’t need to stop with the founder(s). Also,
your employees have unique stories to share - you can easily 2x, 3x, 4x the
impact.

You can’t position yourself as a thought leader without real expertise.

At its core, thought leadership means answering the critical questions of your
target audience.

This means writing only about topics where you truly have expertise. The best
content and sweet spot lies in the intersection of what your thought
leadership topics are and what your audience needs to know.

Many say you should "just be yourself" when creating content.

However, this is not the best approach when it comes to your LinkedIn
presence.

**Ask yourself:**

  * _In which area or topic do potential customers need to perceive you as an expert?_

  * _What industry-specific knowledge can you provide?_

  * _What core concepts must potential customers understand before your solution "clicks" for them?_

  * _What widespread beliefs in your industry do you strongly disagree with?_

  * _What would make selling your product easier if more people understood these concepts?_

  * _What trends (e.g., regulations, technological developments, market pressures) could negatively impact your customers if they don’t adapt?_

  * _What recurring questions do you frequently get asked?_

Great thought leadership content educates, challenges assumptions, and
provides actionable insights.

And then of course ‘be yourself’ and find your tone of voice.

Every post should serve one (or more) of the following goals:

  1. Driving traffic to your website

  2. Generating inbound requests

  3. Positioning you as a thought leader for your ICP

  4. Increasing brand awareness

  5. Attract new employee or partner

Define Your 2-3 Main goals & prioritize them. This helps you structure your
content and keep your strategy focused.
* * *

_**👉 Example Goals for LinkedIn Strategy for a Project Management Tool**_

 _1\. Establish Authority in Project Management Software_

 _Primary Metrics (KPIs):_

  * _Profile views from Project Managers, Product Managers, and Operations Leaders._

  * _Amount of connections from your ICP_

  *  _Engagement rates on technical content about project management_

 _2\. Generate Qualified Pipeline_

 _Primary Metrics (KPIs):_

  * _Website traffic coming from LinkedIn_

  *  _Number of Inbounds with self-reported attribution source ‘LinkedIn’_

  *  _Number of discovery calls booked through LinkedIn content._
* * *

We strongly advise against simply aiming to "go viral." Success on LinkedIn,
and building your founder brand, means delivering the right content to the
right audience consistently over a long period—there are no shortcuts.

Avoid vanity metrics like follows, likes, and comments.

Dark social refers to social media activities that cannot be attributed to a
specific channel

and are not trackable by conventional analytics tools.

It includes private communication channels such as Messaging apps, emails, or
direct messages, where content is shared without a traceable source.

To track leads and generated pipeline, we recommend that every company include
a [self-attribution field](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/155000783/must-have-
self-reported-attribution-in-sign-up-form) in their book a demo/sign-up form
to determine if a lead came from LinkedIn.

Many struggle with the question: What should I post about?

A well-structured content framework eliminates guesswork, making content
creation more intentional and aligned with your business goals.

Defining up to five core content pillars empowers you to:

✅ never run out of content ideas

✅ stay consistent in terms of topics

✅ allow you to go ‘deep’ and share highly valuable content

✅ build topical authority

Each content pillar should connect to three key areas:

  1. Your Expertise & Product – What unique insights can you share?

  2. Your Market Needs – What challenges does your target audience face?

  3. Your Business Goals – How does your content support your growth strategy?

By focusing on these pillars, you create a cohesive message that reinforces
your positioning and keeps your content strategy sustainable.

To illustrate how content pillars work in practice, here’s how a Project
Management SaaS founder might structure its LinkedIn content:
* * *

_**👉 Example Content Pillars for a Project Management Tool**_

  * Productivity & Workflow Optimization (for ICP)

  * Project Management Best Practices (for ICP)

  * Project Management Trends & Insights

  * Challenges in digital project management

  * Collaboration & Team Communication (using project management tools)
* * *

Each topic is broad enough to provide diverse content opportunities yet
specific enough to stay relevant to your audience.

Your content pillars should be a guiding structure, not a rigid rulebook.

As market trends shift and your business evolves, your pillars may need
refinement.

In this section, we’ll break down how to delegate, streamline, and create
content efficiently without compromising authenticity.

For many founders, creating LinkedIn content feels like an uphill battle. You
may relate to one (or more) of these common challenges:

❌You don’t have time to create content.

❌You don’t have a natural inclination for content creation.

❌You’re afraid to outsource your content.

Yet, you know LinkedIn is a powerful platform for thought leadership,
networking, and inbound leads. So, how do you make it work without consuming
your entire schedule?

The Solution: A structured content process that enables you and your team to
build a content engine while investing just 1–2 hours per week.

Pick one member of your team who should interview you.

  1. **Establish a Weekly Content Call:** Set up a dedicated session with each thought leader to generate raw content through discussion rather than writing.

  2. **Prepare 7–10 Thought-Provoking Prompts:** Craft strategic prompts based on your content strategy to guide the conversation.

  3. **Send the Prompts in Advance:** Provide these at least two days before the content call, so the thought leader has time to reflect.

  4. **Record & Transcribe the Conversation: **Capture the discussion via video or audio, then transcribe it for content extraction.

  5. **Extract Key Insights & Video Snippets**: Identify the strongest takeaways, stories, and frameworks to repurpose into LinkedIn posts.

  6. **Write & Refine the Content:** Turn the raw material into authentic LinkedIn posts that maintain the founder’s voice.

  7. **Publish, Track, and Optimize:** Use a content management system to organize posts, gather feedback, and track performance using predefined KPIs.

Before diving into each step, we should first understand what kind of content
we should create.

A great LinkedIn strategy balances different content types to guide your
audience from awareness to conversion. While the specific framework isn’t as
important as alignment with your goals, one effective approach is the TOFU-
MOFU-BOFU model:

**TOFU (Top of Funnel) → Awareness & Engagement**

  * Goal: Capture broad attention and engage a wide audience.

  * Example: “The 5 biggest productivity myths that are slowing your team down”

  * This isn’t directly tied to your ICP but generates reach and engagement.

**MOFU (Middle of Funnel) → Consideration & Education**

**BOFU (Bottom of Funnel) → Conversion & Trust**

  * Goal: Demonstrate expertise, case studies, and success stories to drive conversions.

  * Example: “What happens when you ditch spreadsheets and manage projects the smart way”

Most potential customers are not actively looking for a solution. Your goal is
not to make them buy immediately but to build trust.

Those who continuously share relevant insights—whether through analyses, case
studies, or market data—stay top of mind. And when the decision comes, they
will think of you first.

Creating effective LinkedIn content starts with asking the right questions.

A good prompt sparks a story, insight, or strong opinion—not just a generic
answer.

Create 7–10 content prompts that perfectly align with your LinkedIn ICP.

Maintain a good balance between TOFU, MOFU, and BOFU content types.

**TOFU (Awareness & Engagement)**

  1. **ICP Mistakes Listicle**

 _“What are the top 3-5 mistakes that keep [ICP] from [ideal outcome]?”_

  2. **Trend Reaction**

 _“What's a recent trend in [industry] that you're excited or skeptical about,
and why?”_

  3. **Personal Lesson**

 _“What’s one mistake you made early in your career, and what did it teach you
about [specific topic]?”_

**MOFU (Consideration & Education)**

  4. **Industry Predictions**

 _“What do you think the [ICP] role will look like in [category] in the year
2030? Give me at least 3 specific predictions.”_

 _Example:_

  5. **Problem Solution Framework**

 _“What’s your framework for solving [specific challenge] at [company]?”_

  6. **Sales Calls Trend**

 _“You're on a lot of sales calls and networking calls with [ICP]. What is a
trend you've heard over the past 2-3 weeks that has caught your attention? “_

**BOFU (Conversion & Trust)**

  7. **Sales FAQ**

 _“What’s one of the most common questions you get asked on sales calls before
prospects commit to signing up? What is your typical answer?”_

  8. **Case Studies**

 _“Tell us about one of your successful clients? What problem did they have
and how did your product/service helped them?”_

  9. **Objection Handling**

 _“What’s the most common objection you hear about [company/product], and how
do you address it?”_

  10. **ICP tech stack**

 _“Run me through all the tech and tools a [ICP] needs in their tech stack.”_

A 30–45-minute interview each week generates enough content for multiple
LinkedIn posts.

Routine is key: Hold the session at the same time and place every week to
develop a habit. Without routine, there’s no consistency.

The interviewer’s role: They should know when to dig deeper and challenge the
thought leader. Some questions will be easy to answer, while others will
require pushing for deeper insights to extract real gold nuggets of knowledge.

We recommend using
[Riverside](https://www.riverside.fm/?utm_campaign=campaign_5&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=rewardful&via=alexander-
estner) to record and if you want to edit your videos additionally
descript.com.

Extract the raw material (video and transcript). These are your core assets
for creating LinkedIn posts that genuinely sound like the thought leader. Use
their exact words to maintain authenticity.

Key Aspects to Focus On:

✅Strong hooks

✅Good formatting

✅Subtle product integration—people can sense when they’re being sold to.

How Often Should You Post?

If you want to build a strong presence on LinkedIn and generate real leads as
a SaaS founder, sporadic posting is not enough.

The ideal posting frequency is 3–5 times per week. Anything less? You risk
losing visibility and momentum.

We recommend having a lean content calendar in
[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/hbxl61ilh0ds) or Trello for easy post-
management. And scheduling your posts, so you don’t need to think about it
every day.

However, posting alone isn’t enough.

Spend at least 20 minutes per day engaging with others—commenting on posts
from your target audience, industry peers, and relevant influencers.
Engagement drives reach.

More details on engagement are in the next section.

To ensure that we capture the attention of the right people, we should take a
closer look at the following 10 actionable tactics.

You can leave ‘valuable’ comments on other people’s posts and get your profile
in front of 100s of potential ICPs.

It’s important that the posts/people engaging are part of your target audience
and you share something valuable in the comments (please no AI repetition).

We generally recommend commenting on at least 2–3 posts per day. This way,
people will frequently see your insightful comments, and LinkedIn influencers
will be more inclined to engage with your posts.

People on LinkedIn can generally be categorized as follows:

1️⃣ **Relevant influencers**

If their posts receive millions of views, and you leave the best comment, many
of those views will also come your way—bringing more attention and followers
to you.

2️⃣ **Target Audience**

People who are your **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**. Your key account/
hunting list.

3️⃣ **Customers and Potential Customers**

Your existing customers and people who are in your pipeline (open deals/new
sign-ups).

4️⃣ **Cheerleaders**

Even if they don’t have the biggest profiles, these people are genuinely
supportive and encouraging. They want the best for you and celebrate your
successes.

5️⃣ **Accomplices**

Other emerging professionals on a similar mission with a compatible target
audience.

You can co-create content and exchange insights with them. You grow together.

6️⃣ **LinkedIn Geeks**

These people understand LinkedIn’s algorithm because they "live on and for
LinkedIn," and you can learn a lot from them. They teach you the basics.

**7️⃣ Big Dawgs**

The top executives in your industry. You follow them for inspiration and
interact occasionally. Maybe one day, they will engage with you, and it will
feel magical.

**8️⃣ Cool Kids**

Some people on LinkedIn simply do cool stuff. Their experiments and automation
tricks can help you level up.

**9️⃣ Role Models & Mentors**

Someone in a similar or the same industry who is one or two steps ahead of
you.

Every day, you can open your list, see all the latest posts from your target
audience, and easily engage with them.

If you want to identify additional people, I recommend using **Favikon**.

On **Favikon** , you can find people on LinkedIn and filter them based on
various criteria. This way, you can save the right people and engage with them
daily.

Social Selling on LinkedIn refers to using the platform to identify potential
customers, connect with them, and build relationships to support the sales
process.

To become successful in social selling, you should focus on 3 things:

  1. building a network of people from your ICP

  2. engage with them and share relevant insights

  3. focus on helping, not selling

If there is one mindset that fundamentally changes sales success on LinkedIn,
it is this:

**Stop trying to sell. Start genuinely helping.**

The reason many sales conversations fail is not that an offer is made—but
because it is presented with pressure instead of relevance.

Long-term sales success comes from solving problems—especially ones the
customer is already aware of.

Nobody likes the feeling of being sold to, but everyone appreciates valuable
support.

**If you focus on providing real value, sales will naturally follow.**

Every interaction is an opportunity to deliver value.

  * Maybe with a fresh perspective that optimizes processes.

  * Maybe with a recommendation that prevents unnecessary mistakes.

  * Maybe with an insight that helps someone make a better decision.

And sometimes, this organically leads to business.

If you don’t yet have a relevant network, your focus should be on building one
and becoming visible. This helps you quickly understand the real problems of
your target customers, refine your offer accordingly, and generate revenue
faster.

To do this, you identify decision-makers within your target audience and
**[Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-
ideal-customer-profile)** using tools like **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** and
send up to **200 connection requests per week**.

We generally recommend using the following types of copy in connection
requests:

  1. **No copy** – If you have nothing relevant to say, it’s better to say nothing at all.

  2. **A highly personalized, relevant message**

**Here’s an example 👇**  
 _"Hey [Name] – {{caseStudyCompany}} used {{product}} to {{usecase}} and
achieved {{result}}. We believe this is also realistic for {{companyName}}. I
can share with you a short video with more details. Would you be interested?"_

[Cold outreach](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-best-outbound-tech-stack) is
a numbers game. In the beginning, it helps to build momentum. But the real
value lies in warm signals—people who have already shown interest. They are
your best opportunities and should always be the priority.

Warm leads are people who have visited your profile, commented on your posts,
or liked your content.

If someone engages with your LinkedIn profile, comments on a post, or sends
you a connection request, this is a great opportunity to start a conversation.
The sooner, the better.

Warm Signals Include:

It's important to test different approaches over time to see what works best
for you.

**Profile Visits**

Respond specifically to those who visited your profile and showed interest.

Example:

_"Hey [Name], I saw that you checked out my profile. Just curious—are you
looking for [desired outcome], or are you just enjoying my content?"_

**Engagement with Posts**

Acknowledge those who have engaged with your content and invite them to a
conversation.

Example:

_"Hey [Name], I liked your comment on my post about [topic]. Are you currently
working on [relevant challenge or solution]?"_

_"Hey [Name], I liked your comment on my post about [topic]. I’ve written an
article on this topic: LINK - I thought this could be interesting for you?"_

**New Connection Requests**

Welcome new connections and encourage them to share their intentions.

Example:

_"Hi [Name], thanks for connecting! Are you here to learn more about [specific
challenges or solutions], or are you just exploring? Either way—great to have
you here!"_

💡 Show genuine interest, offer value, and focus on building relationships
first.

Social selling means that you have a bunch of interactions on the social
platform to engage, share value and (dis)qualify the prospect before you try
to book a meeting.

The exact pipeline stages vary from business to business, but the following 5
are a great point to start for you 👇

**Phase 1: Connection Request**

  * **Goal:** Send a connection request and ensure the potential lead is relevant.

  * **Focus:** Find reasons to connect (comments, recommendations, [triggers](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/139777012/step-trigger-message) & signals).

  * **Tip:** If you have nothing relevant to say, send a blank connection request.

  * **Example:  
** "Hi [Name], I saw your comment on [Topic] and found your perspective
interesting."
* * *

**Phase 2: Offer Help**

  * **Goal:** **Don’t sell immediately—first, deliver value.**

  * **Focus:** Build relationships, identify needs through questions, and suggest relevant solutions.

  * **Tip:** Give first, then take. Share helpful content before asking for anything.

  * **Example:  
** "Hi [Name], I recently created a whitepaper on [Topic] for [Target
Audience]. If you’re interested, I’d be happy to share it. Hopefully, it’s
helpful."
* * *

**Phase 3: Qualification**

  * **Goal:** Ensure that the lead is a good fit for your offer.

  * **Focus:** Start to qualify/disqualify based on your ICP definition.

  * **Tip:** Use the right [discovery questions](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/141701489/sales-discovery-questions-example-questions) to gain clarity.
* * *

**Phase 4: Schedule a Meeting**

  * **Goal:** Plan a first call (discovery or [demo call](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-sales-product-demos)).

  * **Focus:** Make it easy to schedule a call (provide options or share your calendar link).

  * **Tip:** Share relevant information in advance to make the meeting productive.

  * **Example:  
** "Here’s a short overview of our method [Link]. Reviewing it will help us
dive straight into the details during our conversation."
* * *

**Phase 5: Follow-Up**

  * **Goal:** Maintain contact and actively move leads through the pipeline.

  * **Focus:** Follow up regularly with relevant messages.

  * **Tip:** Provide **additional value** to rekindle interest.

  * **Example:  
** "Hi [Name], I just published a new case study on how we helped [Company]
solve [Challenge]. Would that be useful for you? I can send it over."

signed up for his product and seconds later I got a DM. It was so fast that I
even thought it was a (nice) automation 😀

Add content to your LinkedIn profile ‘featured’ section.

Depending on your sales process, this can be your lead magnet, free trial,
demo video or book a demo. But make it easy for people to ‘take action’.

Don’t be lazy after posting. The first 30-60 minutes after you post on
LinkedIn is crucial for engagement. So if people engage with your post, make
sure that you respond to their comments.

The best you can do is to create a thread/discussion on your posts. This will
boost your organic reach.

Those are a bunch of people who should add relevant comments to your posts in
the first hour after you post. The best way is to let them know on
WhatsApp/Slack that you have a new post. Make sure that these people are part
of your ICP.
