Hey - it’s Alex!

Welcome to Startup Business Tips, a bi-weekly newsletter, where I share with

business from €0 to €1 million ARR 🚀.

**Today we cover:**

1️⃣ Step 1: Set (big yearly) goals and unpack them (reverse engineering goals)

2️⃣ Step 2: Revamp/Build your GTM Strategy

3️⃣ Step 3: Build an Execution Plan (Activities/Initiatives you want to do)

New year - it’s time for most SaaS founders to set their priorities and goals
for the year.

Don’t make the mistake of jumping into execution mode (step 3) without proper
planning.

Instead, follow my 3 steps.

💡 Goal Setting also means focus and priorities.

Without proper goal setting, you will easily get distracted, follow every new
trend, test millions of things, and be always in the ‘hustle’ mode.

Setting goals means clarity for you.

It’s good to have a revenue goal (e.g. Hit 1€ million ARR) and implement a
[North Star
metric](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/majavoje_in-2024-these-10-common-
misconceptions-
activity-7151527422692122624-EwON?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

One great way to set goals are OKRs (Objective and key results).

It’s a great framework for formulating strategic goals and operationalizing
them.

It consists of 3 elements:

  * **Objectives:** What are the goals you want to achieve?

  * **Key Results:** How do you measure/track the progress/achievement of the objectives?

  * **Initiatives:** What actions will you take to achieve the goals?

**Objective: Be ready for seed funding**

**Key result 1:** Increase New Business ARR from 400k€ to 1million€

**Key result 2:** Increase average contract value (ACV) by 20% from 5k€ to 6k€

**Key result 3:** Increase the deal win rate from 20% to 30%

Check out these 2 pages, they have great OKR examples:
[Okrify](https://okrify.com/saas-okr/) or
[datalligence](https://datalligence.ai/blogs/best-saas-okr-examples/).

This is when reverse engineering is powerful. Reverse engineering your goals
means that you are calculating backward - you unpack the big numbers into
digestible ones.

💡 Because “Our goal is to close 700k€ in new revenue” is very hard to
understand on a daily, weekly, or even monthly base.

**Example: Reverse Engineering**

So let’s say your goal is to increase revenue in Q1 by 200k€.

Assumptions:

  * ACV = 10000€

  * Deal win rate = 30%

  * Discovery (Lead) to Demo conversion = 50%

  * Channels = 100% Outbound

  * Meeting booked rate (Outbound contacted to discovery call) = 5%

  * Sales Cycle = 1 month (to keep the calculation here simple)

  1. Win 20 new deals (200k€ / 10k€)

—> 6,6 new deals per month or 1,5 deals per week

  2. 66 New Deals in Pipeline (20 won deals / 30% win rate)

—> 22 new deals per month or 5,1 per week or 1 per day

  3. 132 discovery calls (66 new deals / 50% conversion)

—> 44 discovery calls per month or 10 per week or 2 per day

  4. 2640 leads contacted (132 discovery calls / 5%)

—> 880 leads contacted per month or 204 per week or 41 per day

“ _You need to get in touch with 41 leads per day_ ” vs. “ _You need to close
200k€ new revenue_ ”

Those tangible goals, you can easily track on a daily, weekly, and monthly
basis and get early feedback if you’re hitting your goals (or not).

P.S. Finetune this calculation with your specifics (e.g. Inbound/Outbound
Ratio, #FTE, sales cycle, etc.).

Do NOT make the mistake to skip this crucial step and jump right into
execution (step 3).

Why?

Because with a solid GTM foundation, your execution gets so much easier and
you will see 10x results.

After step 1, you know your numbers. Now make sure to have a solid GTM
strategy in place.

Focus your work on a strong GTM triangle.

  1. Know who your ideal audience is.

  2. Know your value proposition and how to communicate it, so it resonates with your ICP

  3. Know how you position your product in the (competitive) market.

Here are a few in-depth materials, that will help you build/revamp your GTM.

  4. [The 6 Positioning Options for SaaS](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-positioning-6-different-ways)

The execution part is the last step. Based on the goals and strategy, you
define what you need to do (to achieve your goals).

For me, execution consists of 3 things:

  1. **(GTM) Initiatives** = _new things_ you want to implement (e.g. Change the pricing page or do cold calling hours, Collect customers’ NPS scores)

  2. **(GTM) Activities** = Things you do _consistently_ (e.g. Send 10 cold emails per day or Publish 1 blog post per week)

  3. **To-Dos** = _smaller tasks/things_ you spend your day with (e.g. Research top 10 industry newsletters, Write a new LinkedIn sequence, Send NPS survey to customers)

Let’s quickly summarize the different words and the definitions:

  1. **Goals** = What you want to achieve (see step 1)

  2. **GTM strategy** = the foundation for your GTM execution (see step 2)

  3. **GTM execution** = the operational things you do daily (initiatives, activities, to-dos)

So now, finally, it’s time to do what you love the most ♥️

❤️ Build your beloved Trello, Asana, or Notion “ _Execution Boards_ ” with a
list full of To-Dos.

**Execution Board**

Your Execution Boards are now your compass. Open them in your weekly team
meetings.
