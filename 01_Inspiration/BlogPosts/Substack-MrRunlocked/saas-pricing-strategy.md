Today we cover the topic of SaaS pricing strategy and the question of ‘What is
the right pricing for my SaaS product and how to approach it properly?’.

[The Anatomy of SaaS Pricing
Strategy](https://www.priceintelligently.com/hubfs/Price-Intelligently-SaaS-
Pricing-Strategy.pdf) defines the price as the exchange rate on the value
you’re creating in the world.

This means your SaaS pricing is more than just a simple number. A proper SaaS
pricing strategy includes:

  * deciding on how much you charge (your **price point**) and

  * especially for what you are charging for (your **value metric**),

  * how you present the value to (segments of) the market (your **packaging**),

  * and at what **terms** (your billing, discounts, cancellation).

This means that your pricing is directly related to your ideal customer
profile [ICP](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-
powerful-ideal-customer?s=w) (who do you target), your
[positioning](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-growth-strategy-
guide?s=w) in the market, your [sales strategy (product-led vs. sales-led
growth)](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-
saas-growth?s=w), and therefore ultimately a core part of your [SaaS growth
strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-growth-strategy-
guide?s=w).

Your SaaS pricing is a key part of your [SaaS growth
strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-growth-strategy-
guide?s=w) and directly impacts the growth of your business.

[Joel York](http://chaotic-flow.com/media/saas-growth-strategy.pdf) defines
the growth of a SaaS company as the following:

> **SaaS Growth = Acquisition Rate x Average Customer Lifetime Value**

Simply said, this means you can impact your SaaS growth by

  1. **adding new customers**

  2. **reducing the loss of existing customers (churn)** , and

  3. **increasing the revenue per customer (CLV).**

And increasing the customer lifetime value (CLV) is a combination of keeping
the customer longer (reducing churn) and increasing pricing (revenue per
customer).

For each of them (but especially for the CLV) pricing is crucial. Without a
proper SaaS pricing strategy, you miss out on a lot of revenue growth
potential and risk high churn rates. You will most probably choose the wrong
price point, poorly communicate the value of your product (because of the
wrong value metric), and miss out on promising buyer personas because of wrong
packaging and pricing tiers.

Cost-plus pricing is pretty simple. You are basically selling your product for
a little more (e.g. 35% profit margin) than your costs. The big problem with
cost-plus pricing is that your customers don’t care about your costs, they
care about the value of your product. But of course, knowing how much it costs
you to serve one additional customer (knowing your unit economics), helps you
to figure out what’s the lowest price you can offer (and still be profitable).
This is especially important if you have (high) variable costs for serving a
new customer (e.g. high initial set-up costs like hardware or (high)
performance-related variable costs (e.g. file storing costs)).

Looking at the pricing page of your competitors (competitor-based pricing) can
be a good starting point for your own pricing and helps with benchmarking.
It’s relatively easy to do (simply check the SaaS pricing page of your
competitor and create a spreadsheet with all your competitors) and your
pricing will most probably not be completely off. But the disadvantage of
competitor-based pricing is that you’re following what your competitors are
doing and not focusing on the things that make you special, better, and unique
(your own key value proposition).

I would recommend focusing on your own pricing, following a value-based
pricing strategy, and just looking at the competitors’ pricing for benchmarks
(price point) if you’re in a crowded market (if so, think about ways how you
can create your own (niche) market/category and re-position yourself, so you
aren’t directly comparable with your (in)direct competition). If you are in a
relatively crowded market (blue-ocean market) your price point needs to be
competitive with your direct competition and can’t be completely off.

**Value-based pricing** is the recommended pricing strategy for SaaS
companies. You are basically charging your customers for the value they
receive using your product. The more value your customers receive, the higher
their willingness to pay. In order to effectively run value-based pricing, you
first need to really understand your customers (especially their [needs and
pain points](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-
powerful-ideal-customer?s=w)), then identify the right value metric and price
point, and work on your packaging and pricing terms.

With powerful value-based pricing, you will increase the profitability of your
SaaS business and positively impact your LTV/CAC ratio. You will see how your
customer acquisition costs (CAC) decrease and your customer lifetime value
(LTV) increase. With the right scalable value metric and packaging (pricing
tiers) in place, targeting different market segments (different ICPs and buyer
personas) will get easier.

Also check out [10 SaaS pricing
tips](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/10-hands-on-tips-for-saas-
pricing?s=w) to learn more about popular SaaS pricing models like flat-rate
pricing, usage-based pricing, feature-based pricing, and tiered pricing.

SaaS pricing strategy process in a nutshell:

  * Step 1: Choose your value metric

  * Step 2: Determine the price point (10x rule, Van Westendorp model, LTV/CAC >3)

  * Step 3: Decide on the packaging

  * Step 4: Define your pricing terms (discounts, billing, cancellations)

Strictly speaking, it needs to start as step 0 with understanding your [ideal
customer profile](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-
powerful-ideal-customer?s=w) and their main pain points (you are going to
solve with your product).

Note: If you are just starting your business the exact price point isn’t as
important as it is for later-stage companies. As [Patrick
Campbell](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/saas-pricing-strategy?s=r) said:

> “In the beginning, the actual number you're charging isn't that important.
> There are some exceptions, but for the most part, you should first be
> figuring out the range you're in: a $10 product, $100 product, $1k product,
> etc. Don't waste time debating $500 vs. $505, because this doesn't matter as
> much until you have a stronger foundation beneath you.”

A value metric is “something that a customer or prospect associates value
with” ([Chris Hopf](https://productled.com/blog/how-to-identify-your-value-
metrics-using-the-pricing-metric-decision-guide/)). It’s basically what you
charge your customers for. Typical value metrics in B2B SaaS are: per user,
per bookings, per revenue, per subscriber, per views, and per storage (GB)….

Examples of value metrics:

  * Payment providers —> € Revenue generated / € Transaction volume

  * Email Newsletter Tool —> # of subscribers / # emails sent

  * Video hosting platform —> # videos uploaded / video storage (GB)

Deciding for the right value metric allows you to scale with your customers.
This means the more value they get out of your product, the higher the
willingness to pay and the higher your revenue. This is also true for the
opposite: with the right value metric in place, customers using less of your
product don’t churn, instead, they naturally downgrade and pay less (still
accordingly to the value they receive). This also means that your product is
appealing to different buyer personas and you’re charging accordingly (to the
value they receive) and don’t just charge based on a flat fee so that small
and large customers are paying the same.

So you are basically aligning your interest (grow revenue) with your
customers’ interest (getting more value).

Or as pricing expert [Patrick
Campbell](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/saas-pricing-strategy?s=r) says

> “a value metric however allows you to have essentially infinite price points
> — maximizing your revenue potential”.

Campbell](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/saas-pricing-strategy?s=r)
(Pricing your SaaS product); guest post in Lenny Rachitsky newsletter

Choosing your value metric is key, so make sure that your value metric is:

**1\. Easy to understand**

Keep your pricing simple. Every prospect needs to understand your pricing. If
your pricing is too complex or it takes them a lot of time/thinking to
understand, you will lose potential customers (they will not sign up on your
website OR aren’t convinced of the value during a sales demo).

If your pricing is good, prospects will immediately understand your pricing
(especially the value metric), know which package is the right one for them,
and how much they will pay for it (as they know how many of the ‘value metric’
they need, e.g. how many users, leads, bookings…). They will think “Yeah, this
product is made for me and that’s the right plan for me”.

Exercise: If you are following a [sales-led
growth](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-
saas-growth), ask your sales team to pitch your pricing to 10 prospects in
under 30 seconds. If out of the 10, more than 2 prospects don’t get it, your
pricing is most probably too complicated (or you have bad sales reps 😜). For
[product-led growth](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-
vs-sales-led-saas-growth?s=w), share your pricing page with 10 prospects and
ask them if they can pitch and explain you your pricing in their own words. If
they fail, you know your pricing is not simple (enough).

**2\. Aligned with the value your customer receives using your product**

Your value metric needs to align with the value your customer receives using
your product.

It’s key to understand what your customers want. What is the objective and
outcome they are looking for? What is the expected value (results) of your
product for the customer?

As Tomasz Tunguz [says](https://tomtunguz.com/three-value-propositions/), in
B2B SaaS it will most probably be more revenue, fewer costs, or higher
productivity.

So this means you need to measure and quantify the value - ideally you can do
that (see Step 2: Determine your price point).

**3\. Grows with the customer’s usage of the product**

The higher the usage of the product, the more of the value metric is used, and
the higher the value of your product for the customers, which leads to a
higher willingness to pay. So your revenue scales with the usage of your
customers (e.g. for an Email marketing software: more emails sent leads to
more revenue). This means you have a ‘built-in’ lock-in effect and prevent
customers from ‘growing out of your tool’. This leads to lower churn and
higher lifetime values (LTV).

Next, after you‘ve decided on your value metric, it’s time to determine your
price point.

Your value metric needs to align with the value your customer receives using
your product. This means you need to measure the value and quantify it (if
possible). Quantifying the value of your product is super important.

If you can easily measure and quantify it (e.g. new revenue generated €), you
should pick that as your value metric. In case you can’t, try to find the best
proxy for the value that your product delivers (in 99% you will find a great
proxy for the value). The best proxy for the value is your value metric.

If you’re just starting with your business, it’s hard to exactly know the
value of your product as you don’t have lots of customer data, so try to
estimate and calculate the value. A great way to do that is to apply the **10x
rule.**

**The 10x rule** basically says that customers will buy your product if their
return on investment is a minimum of 10x.

This means that you need to make sure that the value your product delivers is
at least a 10x compared to what you are charging. If the value for the
customers is below 10x, they are not convinced.

Here are some examples:

  * Our CRM tool helps Sales teams to close 20% more deals per month. We know on average our customer’s sales team closes 10 deals per month with an ARPA of 500€/month. This means we enable our customers to close 12 (instead of 10) deals per month, which results in 1000€/month more revenue. Based on the rule of 10x we can justify charging 100€/month for our tool.

  * Our invoicing tool helps freelancers to save time creating invoices by 50%. We know on average a freelancer sends 6 invoices per month and needs 30min/per invoice to create and send them. This means it takes 3h every month for them. Charging 150€/h as a freelancer, the opportunistic costs are 450€/month. Based on the rule of 10x we can justify charging 45€/month for our tool or better 7,5€ per invoice per month (opportunistic cost per invoice is 75€ —> rule of 10x = 7,5€ per invoice). This means the number of invoices generated per month is a good proxy for the value.

  * Our hr engagement software helps companies to reduce employee churn by 50%. Assuming that replacing an employee with a new one costs 6000€ (incl. lay-off costs, hiring costs, onboarding costs…) and your company has a 20% employee churn rate, you can calculate the value of your product. A company with 500 employees needs to replace 100 employees per year (without your software), which costs them 100*6000€ = 600k€ per year. Using your software reduces the employee churn rate to 10%, so they only need to replace 50 employees per year, lowering the related costs to 300k€ per year. The value of your product is 300k€ per year, so applying the rule of 10x, you can easily justify a 30k€ annual contract value.

Having already (lots) of paying customers and historical data, it’s getting
easier to calculate the real value of your product. Is it true that you
increase the sales efficiency by 20%? Can you really cut the time for
invoicing by 50%? Talk to your customers, ask for feedback and measure the
results of your product.

Another great method, especially for (later stage) companies that already have
an established customer base, is the Van Westendorp method.

The Van Westendorp model is a customer research approach. Basically, you ask
your existing customers in a survey about their willingness to pay and run
your analysis based on the answers.

You will ask your customers 4 questions and based on the answers you can
calculate (and visualize) your ideal price range. The 4 questions are the
following:

  1. At what price would you consider the product to be so expensive that you would not consider buying it? (Too expensive)

  2. At what price would you consider the product to be priced so low that you would feel the quality couldn’t be very good? (Too cheap)

  3. At what price would you consider the product starting to get expensive, so that it is not out of the question, but you would have to give some thought to buying it? (Expensive/High Side)

  4. At what price would you consider the product to be a bargain—a great buy for the money? (Cheap/Good Value)

Analysis of the answers lets you calculate the ideal price range as well as at
what price point you will maximize the revenue potential. Check out [the
Anatomy of SaaS Pricing
Strategy](https://www.priceintelligently.com/hubfs/Price-Intelligently-SaaS-
Pricing-Strategy.pdf) for a step-by-step guide on applying the Van Westendorp
Model.

So now, as you know your value metric and the price point of your offering,
you can put together different packages (your pricing tiers). That’s what you
mostly see on different SaaS pricing pages.

Different customer segments receive different values from using your product
and sometimes even value specific features over others. That’s why you should
ideally offer 3 to a maximum of 4 different pricing tiers, each pricing tier
represents a different segment of your customers.

Ask yourself if there are specific features that only a specific segment of
customers need? Do you have features primarily relevant to small customers or
large customers? Then only include those in the specific pricing tier. What
are the core features everyone needs and also what features depend on each
other? Do you offer features that are only relevant for special customers?
Think about excluding them from your standard plans and offer them as add-ons.

Check out Jonas Rieke's article on [data-driven framework for SaaS
packaging](https://medium.com/inside-personio/developing-a-data-driven-
packaging-for-your-saas-product-703a67648dc4).

When structuring your pricing plans keep in mind price anchoring. Including a
relatively expensive pricing plan (mostly an Enterprise or Premium Plan) into
your pricing, your other pricing tiers will look comparably cheap.

The last step is deciding on your SaaS pricing terms. This mostly includes
taking decisions on your discount policy, billing and payment options, as well
as the cancellation policy.

You need to decide on your discount strategy. Normally you offer up to a
maximum of 20% discount (better 10-15%) for yearly upfront payments (vs.
monthly payments). For enterprise deals, you can also offer discounts on long-
term contracts (e.g. 3 or 5-year contracts). If you are following a [sales-led
growth strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-
sales-led-saas-growth), how flexible can your sales team offer discounts? Try
to establish clear rules on discounting.

Your discount policy also depends on the stage of your company (early-stage
trying to find product-market fit vs. scaling your business with 2-3x growth
per year). In both cases, it’s recommended to get something in exchange for
the discount. In early-stage this could be:

  * a testimonial

  * a case study (e.g. share specific metrics before they implement your software and after and create a case study on how your tool helped them to increase revenue, decrease costs, increased productivity…)

  * joining an interview, or

  * being a referral partner. 

For later-stage companies, you can offer a discount in exchange for:

In enterprise sales commitments around IP and professional services could be
interesting for negotiation.

What kind of billing options do you offer. For SaaS most common are monthly
payments or yearly upfront payments. Does it make sense to offer quarterly
payments as well? And most importantly what does the billing process look
like? Do you make it easy for the customers to pay for your product (e.g.
credit card payment) and is the pricing transparent and clear?

*Note: Check out subscription billing tools like [Chargebee](https://www.chargebee.com/saas-billing/).

You need to decide on how your customers can cancel their subscriptions. Most
startups offer monthly cancellation (for monthly paid plans). Along with the
cancellation policy, you need to think about how customers can upgrade and
downgrade during their contract? For yearly plans, the most common is that
customers can upgrade anytime, while downgrading is only possible to the next
billing date.

Grandfathering is relevant when you’re deciding to update your existing
pricing and you already have paying customers. Then you ultimately ask
yourself the question of how to handle your existing customers? Do they need
to change to the new pricing or do you offer them to stick to their existing
pricing plan?

That’s where grandfathering comes in handy. Grandfathering basically means
that your existing customers remain in your old pricing, while your new
pricing is applied to all new customers. Of course, you should always offer
your existing customers to switch to a new pricing plan - especially if you
restructure your plans and can be beneficial for them.

Exercise: Now you know a lot about SaaS pricing. Check out 5 SaaS pricing
pages of your favorite SaaS tools and try to analyze their pricing. Let me
know what you discover.

The conversion rate of your pricing page is the highest if you highlight one
of your tiers. People tend to decide on products that are highlighted or in
some way 'isolated' from the rest of the options. A great way to do this is to
highlight one tier with a badge (e.g. most popular), different color, or a
frame.

Offer discounts for long-term contracts (e.g. yearly upfront payments). For
your annual discounts, you can offer up to a 20% discount (don’t offer more
than that). Based on [Patrick
Campell](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/saas-pricing-strategy?s=r)
percentage discounts work less well than absolute discounts (e.g. 2 months for
free). So think about offers like: Get 2 months for free (only pay 10 months
instead of 12) for annual contracts.

To keep it simple and easy to understand for your potential customer, limit
the number of options they can choose from. It's called the paradox of choice
- the more options they have to choose from the harder it's for them to make a
decision.

Price anchoring is a concept, where you leverage the fact, that humans use
reference points to assess the price and value of something. Use smart pricing
(nudging) to nudge customers for your preferred tier. One powerful way is to
make your more expensive tier 'relatively' cheap compared to the cheaper
options, so your customers get the feeling that this is a 'great deal'.

Unless you are selling SaaS to really large customers (Enterprise market) you
should have a pricing page on your website with transparent pricing.

Freemium is a great acquisition strategy for later-stage startups that target
a huge market. Freemium only works if you have a super large TAM (total
addressable market) and is better for well-established players (e.g. Zoom,
Dropbox, Slack, Calendly…). Jason Lemkin recently said that you need [50
million active users for freemium to actually
work](https://www.saastr.com/you-need-50-million-users-for-freemium-to-
actually-work/).

If you are early stage and offer a freemium plan, you will not know if your
customer really values your product (and later on are willing to upgrade to a
paid plan). So it’s better to go with free trials and paid plans.

In most early-stage companies you don’t have a Chief revenue officer and the
responsibility for pricing is mostly shared between product, sales &
marketing. But shared responsibility also means most of the time no one really
feels accountable and cares about it. This leads to almost no optimization and
iteration of your pricing.

So first of all take a decision on who is accountable for pricing in your
company. Then make sure to establish a culture where you at least twice a year
work on your pricing strategy. Areas to experiment with are value metrics,
price points (e.g. increase your prices), packaging (e.g. moving features to
different tiers), and positioning (your customer segments), but also add-on
features/services, discount strategy, billing options as well as specifics
about expanding to new markets (e.g. new currencies) or new products (e.g.
bundles).
