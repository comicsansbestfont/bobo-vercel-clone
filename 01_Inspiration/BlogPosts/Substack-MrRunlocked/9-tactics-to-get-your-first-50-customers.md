recharging in Thailand Koh Phangan 👆

2024 was an intense and challenging year for me.

👉 being a solopreneur  
👉 running this awesome newsletter  
👉 helping 15+ SaaS founders  
👉 getting married  
👉 building a house

Not in a bad way. Just intense. It required a lot of energy.

So it was time to recharge. Recharging for all the things coming in 2025.

So I decided to take 4 weeks off over Christmas & New Year. Including **NOT**
sending a newsletter at that time.

Instead, I enjoyed life with my wife in Thailand 🇹🇭  

😎 Lots of Sun and Sea  
🧘‍♂️ Yoga, Pilates & Gym  
☕ Yummy food & coffee  
📗 Books & Reflection

Now I’m back full of energy and working on super exciting content for you 🎉

**A few topics that we will cover in the next episodes:**

👉 Guide on Founder-Led LinkedIn

👉 Guide on SEO for early-stage SaaS

👉 The perfect SaaS Pricing page

Working with SaaS founders on GTM the #1 question I get is.

**What channels and tactics should we test to win new customers???**

But every startup is different. What channels and tactics work for your SaaS
depend on a few factors, including:

✅ your type of [Ideal Customers](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-
ideal-customer-profile) (where they hang out, how they buy products, etc.)

✅ your (founder) skills ([founder-led
sales](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/first-gtm-hire))

✅ your [pricing](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-b2b-saas-pricing-
guide) (enterprise sales is different than selling to prosumers)

✅ the competitive landscape & maturity of the market (can you [capture
existing demand](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-content-marketing-
guide)?)

So you can't just copy and paste from others. You need to see what works for
your situation.

👉 Reach out to people in your network.

👉 Ask your investors, advisors, friends, etc for intros

👉 Ask your first customers for intros. Learn how to [ask for referrals the
right way](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/referral-sales).

> “ _Okay, thanks for the demo. Great to see that (your company name) is a
> good fit for you. Now that you know who we work with
> (your[ICP](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/framework-ideal-
> customer-profile)) and what our product can do for companies like you, who
> are 2-3 other companies/people you think can benefit from it, too?_”

…and then if they tell you some names, respond the following:

> “ _Thanks. Would you mind making an email intro for me? If you want, I can
> also send you an intro template to make it easier for you_ ”.

👉 Engage with 3-5 relevant experts and pay them to promote your product.

👉 Post daily and comment daily to build thought leadership. Follow the [9
social selling tactics](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/9-linkedin-social-
selling-tactics) that drive impact.

👉 Track intent and reach out to ICPs. (V1 intent data: profile views, likes,
comments)

👉 Alternative & comparison pages (for existing product categories). Works
great in rather crowded red-ocean markets with existing demand. ([25+ Content
Templates](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/147302979/content-types-examples))

👉 Bet on high-intent keywords on Google. ([Google Ads
Guide](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/google-ads-guide))

👉 Find newsletters that are read by your target audience. Goes hand in hand
with 4️⃣

One of the best alternative page hubs I've seen in a long time.

[Arnaud Belinga 🧊🔨](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnaud-belinga-social-selling-
crm-saas/) and the [Breakcold](https://www.breakcold.com/alternatives) team
did a great job.  

Alternative pages are a great [growth
tactic](https://alexestner.gumroad.com/l/database-growth-strategies-saas) for
SaaS companies in crowded markets. And CRM is 100% a red ocean. But I'm sure
they will receive lots of traffic from this page.

Here’s what they did:

✅ Created 50+ Comparison pages (Breakcold vs. Competitor X)

✅ Created a pillar page (aka Alternative Pages Hub)

✅ Made this page public (linked in the footer)

On [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexander-estner_one-of-the-best-
alternative-page-hubs-ive-
activity-7285914158561193984-iYWX?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop),
we had a great discussion if you should hide these pages or make them public.
What’s your take?

So if you operate in a crowded market and your ICP is [product or product
category aware](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/147302979/step-map-your-stages-
of-awareness), the following BOFU Content pages are for you:

👉 Comparison — {You} vs {Competitor}  

👉 Comparison — {Competitor} vs {Competitor}  

👉 Comparison — {Competitor} vs {Competitor} vs {You}

👉 Comparison — {Competitor} Alternative  

👉 Alternatives — X Best {Competitor} Alternatives

👉 Product list — X Best {Product Category} Tools  

I’ve collected 20+ examples in the [Ultimate Content Marketing
Guide](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-content-marketing-guide), so
you can get started right away.

Learning about your customers is key. While you get a lot of insights talking
to your customers, there are 2 easy ways to gain valuable insights on the fly.

The first one is called self-reported attribution. It means that your
customers tell you how they found you/your product.

This one is pretty simple. You ask your customers:

_**“How did you hear about us?”**_

By doing so you will learn what channels work to optimize your campaigns.

Depending on your sales motion, the information can be collected in multiple
ways:

**1️⃣ Sign-up form / Book demo**

**2️⃣ Onboarding flow**

3️⃣ On the sales call

Of course, you can combine these methods.

Make sure that you save this information in your CRM (custom field).

Learning why you’re losing the deal is pure gold. But most founders don’t
track the reasons systematically in their CRM-

Here are the 7 reasons I recommend tracking 👇

1️⃣ Decided for competition  

2️⃣ Status quo sufficient  

3️⃣ Decision delayed  

4️⃣ Too expensive / no budget  

5️⃣ missing key feature  

6️⃣ no response  

7️⃣ other

Below you see a screenshot of how you can do this in your CRM (Hubspot).

A few things to consider:

❌ Using open text boxes to track reasons is not ideal.

✅ Instead, use dropdown options.

✅ These 7 pre-defined lost reasons should cover 90% of your lost deals.

✅ In case you see an emerging reason in your 'other' bucket you could add them
as a dropdown option (e.g. Compliance risk).

✅ Having pre-defined reasons makes analyzing lost reasons easier.

✅ Add an (optional) text field to add more context to the lost reasons.

**Happy growth 🚀**
