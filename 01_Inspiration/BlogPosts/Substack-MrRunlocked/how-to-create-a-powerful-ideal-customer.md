In a lot of my previous articles (e.g. [How to grow from 10 to 100 paying
customers](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-grow-
from-10-to-100-paying) or [Launch your B2B SaaS startup with a powerful Go-to-
market strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/go-to-market-
strategy-8-steps-for?s=w)), I wrote about your **ideal customer profile
(ICP).**

Your ICP is a core element of your go-to-market strategy and crucial for your
sales and marketing success.

You will see that having a clear ICP results in high-quality leads that will
show better conversion rates (because they resonate with your messaging, your
value proposition, and your product), a shorter sales cycle, and more happy
paying customers (with a higher NPS score). This also means that fewer
customers will churn (lower churn rate) because they see the value in your
product, and you will see more referrals coming in. So you will increase your
average customer lifetime value.

For B2B businesses (vs. B2C businesses) your ICP describes a (fictitious)
company that is most likely to benefit from and buy your product. Include
characteristics about the company like the number of employees, revenue, or
industry (“firmographics”).

Lots of people also talk about buyer persona, which refers to the person who
is involved in a purchasing decision at the company (your ICP). Who are they
and what roles do they have? What are their jobs to be done, motivations, and
goals?

So when you sell a B2B SaaS product, your ICP is the company, where a specific
buyer persona (e.g. Head of HR) is in charge of the buying process.

But to better understand your ICP (ideal customer profile) we need to have a
closer look at the difference between a **target audience vs. potential
customers vs. your ICP.**

In the following, I'm referring to a great model by **[Myk Pono (Ideal
Customer Profile (ICP): How To Create A Comprehensive Customer
Profile)](https://www.mykpono.com/ideal-customer-profile-icp-how-to-create-a-
comprehensive-customer-profile/).**

Your larger **target audience** is this part of the market **(= segment)**
that all share the same **pain points,** meaning they all face similar
challenges/problems you are trying to solve with your product.

But just because they feel and suffer the same pains, this does not
necessarily mean they all want the same solution for their problem. You
normally can solve pains with multiple solutions.

Here are some examples of pains and different ways to solve them:

  * Hiring new developers is hard —> Increase recruiting budget; Hire dedicated recruiter; Write better job ads; Better employer branding...

  * Having not enough customer insights in CRM —> Train sales reps on CRM; Automate CRM Steps; Hire a Sales operation manager...

So this being said, your target audience simply shares the same pain points.
Some examples of different target audiences for different business ideas:

  * sales enablement software (reducing onboarding time for new sales reps)—> VP of sales; head of sales

  * social media scheduling software (reducing the time per posting by 50%) —> VP of marketing, head of marketing

  * hr software for recruiting (to hire 2x faster with a build-in integration to all job platforms) —> VP of people; head of recruiting

👉 **Target audience = Pain Points**

But sharing the same pain points does NOT necessarily mean that the way you
address the problem is a fit for them.

Your **potential customers** are a subset of your target audience. They do not
only share the pain points, your product is also a **fit** for them (**Pain
Points + Fit**). A fit means that your product or service fits the specific
needs and situation of the target audience (see example above with
recruiting). The value proposition of your product is relevant to them.

Here are some examples of it:

  * sales enablement software (reducing onboarding time for new sales reps)—> VP of sales; head of sales **with min. 10 new sales reps/year**

  * social media scheduling software (reducing the time per posting by 50%) —> VP of marketing, head of marketing with **min. 3x posts a week on 2 different social media platforms**

  * hr software for recruiting (to hire 2x faster with a build-in integration to all job platforms) —> VP of people; head of recruiting **with 10+ open jobs and company annual revenue below 50M€**

So let's take the example of hiring. For almost every hr department it is
important to hire new employees fast, but while larger organizations could
hire headhunters or recruiting agencies to help them (as they have a bigger
budget), startups and small companies with a smaller budget need to do
recruiting in-house (and therefore would be a better fit for your recruiting
software).

👉 **Potential customers = Pain Points + Fit**

And finally, your **ICP** (ideal customer profile) combines **Pain + Fit +
Readiness.**

This means, that your ICP feels the pain (that you are solving with your
product), your product, and the way you approach the problem is relevant to
them (FIT) and they are ready for a solution. [Myk
Pono](https://www.mykpono.com/ideal-customer-profile-icp-how-to-create-a-
comprehensive-customer-profile/) says that “ideally, the person who fits your
ICP is aware of the problem and already looking for a solution”.

To continue with the example above with recruiting, this could mean your **ICP
is:**

👉 **ICP = Pain + Fit + Readiness**

So let's have a deep dive into the 5 **practical steps** on how to actually
create your ideal customer profile.

Start to manually create a dream list of 100 companies that represent your
ICP. Those dream customers should be real companies or persons who have the
pain you are trying to solve (no fictional companies). Just start with a
simple spreadsheet and collect relevant information about them (industry,
revenue, #employees, company stage, country...) that are relevant to your
product. See if you can even build segments within your ICP.

The buyer persona is the specific person within your ICP company who is in
charge of the decision-making. Users are the ones who are later on using your
product. This being said, the buyer persona can be also a user but does not
necessarily have to. Example: Social Media Scheduling Software:

Start to take notes (really write them down) about the buyer persona and the
users. Include things like **job title, department, age, gender** and enrich
them with the information from a **day in the life of your customer** and the
**customer behavior**.

The more you know about your customers, the higher chance you will be seen as
an expert (customers trust experts), and the more likely you will nail your
sales and marketing communication. Especially if you’re following a [sales-led
growth](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-
saas-growth?s=w) your sales team needs to be industry experts (so whenever
potential customers talks to your sales team, they are seen as experts and
they can better sell the values of your product and not just features).

So digging deeper into the daily life of your customers, helps you to enrich
your rough picture of your ICP.

The best way to do so is by doing customer interviews, surveys, and job
shadowing. With job shadowing, I mean sitting by their side while they’re at
work.

I’ve seen sales and product managers spending days together with their
customers (e.g. with sports venues, coffee & restaurant owners, and also with
HR Managers responsible for payrolls)

Write down what their daily job looks like and try to get information about...

  * ... their daily activities (take notes on what they do and how long it takes them to do)

  * ... their responsibilities

  * ... their goals & success metrics (how is their performance measured)

  * ... their challenges and pain points (what do they care about; also include pain points they do not (directly) relate to your product)

When you spend (enough) time with your potential ICP you will understand their
behavior. Knowing how they think, what they care about, and what they are
doing is key information for you. Those are unique insights that you can use
to tailor your sales messaging for your ICP.

Get answers on:

  * _What software tools are they using?_

  * _What partnerships do they have?_

  * _Who else is also selling a complimentary service/product to them?_

  * _What content/website/newsletter do they read?_

  * _Who are they following? What events are they taking part in?_

  * _Who do they want to become? Who are their role models?_

  * _and many more..._

To know if your ICP is ready to buy your product, knowing relevant trigger
events and using them in your sales and marketing activities are really
powerful. With the right triggers identified, you know your ICP needs your
solution now.

For every product or company, those trigger events can be different. For the
example of our recruiting software, good triggers could be:

  * new Team Lead Recruiting —> new leaders mostly want to implement new tools

  * new legal requirements on GDPR —> need to migrate to another solution?

  * bad reviews about recruiting on job platforms (e.g. Kununu) —> need to invest in a better recruiting process

  * new investment round —> this means most probably hiring new people —> good timing to approach them with your recruiting software

  * number of open job listings above 10 —> means recruiting is a priority right now

  * new VP of people

Some other triggers for other products could be _negative reviews, new product
launches, running tv advertisements, development of stock price, revenue
development, company relocation, press coverage, social media
engagement_....and many more.

profile by Myk Pono](https://www.mykpono.com/ideal-customer-profile-icp-how-
to-create-a-comprehensive-customer-profile/).

Working on your ICP is (unfortunately) not a one-time event. You should
frequently analyze your customers and identify your most successful customers
and based on that iterate on your ICP.

Successful customers are the ones you should focus on and try to find more of
them. They value your product and help you to run a healthy business (LTV/CAC
>3) long-term.

Indicators for successful customers typically are:

  * high NPS score

  * upgrading to a more expensive pricing tier

  * increase in usage (more sessions, more seats, more features...)

  * more (inbound) interaction with you (to discuss new features, optimize workflows...)

  * actively referring new customers

With a powerful ICP, it's getting much easier for you to acquire the right
customers and grow your business.
