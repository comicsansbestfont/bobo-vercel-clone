There's a dangerous myth circulating among founders

 _**"Once you reach €X in revenue, you can hand off sales to professionals and
focus on being a real CEO."**_

This well-intentioned but catastrophically wrong advice has killed more
promising startups than we can count.

Being involved in and being the steward of the revenue engine is a lifelong
founding decision. **One founder must always be involved**.

_**👉 The Founder needs to be the Revenue Steward 👈**_

The fallacy that you transition out— it's very appealing for sales agencies,
coaches, or advisors to sell to founders, because very few people want to do
sales.

> _"I'll help you transition out of sales. Let's get you out of sales."_

But as a founder, it’s an absolute necessity.

Seth has worked with 100+ founders and watched the rise (and fall) of
countless B2B SaaS companies, It’s become clear that:

**Founder-led sales isn't a phase you graduate from—it's a permanent
responsibility.**

Founder-led sales isn't just about the founder personally closing deals
(though it starts there).

It's about the founder driving the revenue engine for the entire existence of
the company.

Yes, your role will evolve. Yes, you'll eventually build a team. But no, you
should never fully disconnect from sales.

Think of it this way:

  * In the beginning, you're the engine.

  * Later, you're the engineer.

  * Eventually, you're the architect.

But you're always, ALWAYS responsible for ensuring the machine runs.

✅ It's certainly transitioning out of solo selling or founder selling,

❌ But not out of sales entirely.

Founders need to have a mindset that one person on the founding team will own
that revenue forever, be deeply involved, and not try to get out of it.

The biggest killer of startups is a detachment from reality. It’s how
promising startups die.

Founders who delegate sales too early find themselves completely disconnected
from market reality.

They lose touch with critical market truths:

  * Are customers actually willing to pay for your solution?

  * Which features truly drive purchase decisions?

  * What objections consistently block deals?

  * Is the [pricing](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-b2b-saas-pricing-guide) aligned with perceived value?

  * Who do you compete most with ([direct & indirect competition](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/3-types-of-competition))?

  * Is your [messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-framework) still resonating with your ICP?

So when growth stalls, they lack the context to diagnose what's wrong.

❌ Founders with unreasonable expectations of their salespeople or sales
leaders.

✅ A great leader is in touch with reality and has an understanding of what's
going on.

So one more time: **One Founder must own the go-to-market motion for a very
long time.**

In the search for product-market fit, you start to uncover unique aspects that
allow for a go-to-market motion to be performed.

When you do outbound prospecting yourself, you understand nuances like

✅ The [messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-
framework) needed to attract a prospect,

✅ What makes a good [ICP &](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-
customer-profile) Buyer persona

✅ What they care about (Pain points, objections, critical events…)

Having someone else figure out these aspects increases the likelihood of
failure because you are unclear about critical points like

  * What goals should you set for your business?

  * What is the best way to deploy resources?

  * Who is the best hire?

  * What should be your product roadmap?

All these things require the founder to be close to the metal, close to the
action, steering from the source of truth, and it comes only from direct
communication with the customer.

If there is anyone else between you (the founder) and the customers/prospects,
you'll most likely receive biased information based on who's giving it to you.

For these reasons, the founder must be close to the go-to-market forever.

**But the way you are responsible for sales will change over time.**

So let’s have a closer look at the 6 phases of founder-led sales.

As a founder, you will evolve in 6 phases:

1️⃣ Phase 1: Finding Product-Market Fit

2️⃣ Phase 2: Acquiring First Customers

3️⃣ Phase 3: Making Your First Sales Hire(s)

4️⃣ Phase 4: Making It Predictable

5️⃣ Phase 5: Multiple Sales Hires

6️⃣ Phase 6: Hiring a Sales Leader

You're personally validating that customers will pay for your solution.
Without problem-solution-fit, there's nothing to sell, but the search for
product-market fit inherently involves selling—you can't validate product-
market fit without customers exchanging cash for your value.

→ As you know, Alex calls this phase ‘hustle-mode’.

Many founders make a catastrophic mistake here: they build first, then try to
sell later. This inverts the natural order and usually leads to building
features nobody wants to pay for.

Thinking about finding product-market fit without thinking about acquiring
customers makes no sense.

The premise of "if we build it, then they will come" misses the point that if
you're not out in front of the customers, understanding what to build, they
won't come.

Technically, if you have one customer, you still have product-market fit, but
it’s quite weak, so don’t start celebrating product-market fit too much until
you have multiple customers.

The purest feedback on features comes from those willing to exchange cash for
your value. Everything else is just speculation. Without someone willing to
pay for those features is just ideas and not concrete evidence that people
would actually be interested in buying.

❌ **The wrong way**

Build features → Launch → Hope someone buys → Get feedback → Start selling

✅ **The right way**

Start selling before your product is fully built. Or better yet - build
_while_ you sell.

Talk to potential customers → Pre-sell or get strong commitments → Build an
MVP based on real demand → Optimize with early adopters → Grow

Building in a vacuum is a startup killer.

Build with your market, not for it.

Getting early commitments can be:

Yes, you'll need some MVP to show them, but there's no reason to delay
acquiring customers when the most critical part of the company is product-
market fit, and strong product-market fit means that there are clients pulling
the product and a massive need being filled.

Typically, customer acquisition is scary because it requires hearing the truth
from clients, telling you your baby is ugly. But the sooner that happens, the
better. The sooner you'll be able to iterate, build the features needed that
clients will pay for.

This being said,

**Acquiring customers as the founder is the absolute most important step in
the early days of the company.**

You're personally closing deals and beginning to recognize patterns in what
works. You are acquiring customers for the purpose of learning, until the
process becomes repeatable.

This is where you develop lightweight "micro-playbooks" that can eventually be
taught.

→ This phase is not about scaling.

It mostly is about doing non-scalable things to learn and get 1-2 channels
performing.

2025](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/9-tactics-to-get-your-first-50-customers).

That entire process becomes the backbone of the company. If there is
repeatability, and you get to the point where, with more horsepower, you can
accelerate that repeatability, that's when you get into Phase 3, where you're
making your first sales hire(s).

The most misunderstood phase in the journey is the first sales hire.

Too many founders see this as their escape hatch from sales - they make the
first sales hire incorrectly based on wanting to get out of sales. That's when
they often make too senior of a hire, and they f*** it up.

**You don't make your first sales hire to get out of sales. You make it to
supplement and accelerate what's already working because you are at
capacity.**

This isn't a "get out of sales" move. You never transition out of sales. You
transition out of solo selling. You never really transition out of being the
leader of the revenue organization, because whatever happens, it's the CEO's
responsibility for revenue.

So the founder stays involved in sales forever.

Some people say you should be the only seller until you're up at €1 million
ARR.

While we could discuss if this is the right threshold, it’s a good mindset to
have, because it sets the expectation that you need to close a lot of deals
before you think about making a first sales hire. And it goes without saying
that your customers need to be happy with the product and stick around without
churning before thinking of adding more horsepower to customer acquisition.

The right time to make this hire isn't based on some arbitrary revenue number.
It's when:

  1. You have a repeatable way to acquire customers (and keep them)

  2. You're capacity constrained ("If I just had more time, I could close more deals")

  3. You can clearly articulate the pattern that's working

So the most common mistakes we see in this phase are:

**❌ Hiring too early (before you find patterns that are working)**

It's critical to know that repeatability is essential to make a first sales
hire successful.

If you can't repeatedly acquire customers, you might not have product-market
fit, and you certainly don't have Go-To-Market fit. So you need to go back to
the previous phases before you get here.

**❌ Hiring a sales leader as your first hire**

A sales leader, by nature, is someone who's managing people, not someone who's
managing sales opportunities/deals.

If you're hiring a sales leader as your first sales hire, you're extricating
yourself from sales, from being close to the truth. You're putting a buffer
between the founder and the truth, and you will likely fail. If you’re
thinking about managing risk, this is the riskiest thing you can do.

Instead, bring on a hands-on sales Swiss Army knife - Seth likes to call them
a "Sales Pioneer"—a rare breed with a specific set of attributes. It's in
fashion to call it a "founding account executive" (sounds sexy) or a "go-to-
market account executive" (also sounds sexy).

Your Sales Pioneer isn't your average Account Executive. It's an account
executive who has some specific qualities that make them a pioneer.

**❌ Hiring the wrong profile (no sales pioneer)**

You bring on a "[Sales
Pionee](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/161309912/mistake-hiring-the-wrong-
first-salesperson-pioneer-ae)r" to supplement (not replace) your selling
efforts. You're still deeply involved in sales, now with added bandwidth. The
key to this phase is having some repeatability in finding those first few
customers.

**You're only making a sales hire because you need to supplement and
accelerate the repeatability of acquiring customers.**

In our recent newsletter, we talked about the characteristics of the [Sales
Pioneer](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/161309912/mistake-hiring-the-wrong-
first-salesperson-pioneer-ae).

But Seth added a few good additions, so here is the combined list now.

✅ **Startup Experience**

✅ **Strong Prospecting Skills**

✅ **Proven Closing and pipeline-building experience**

✅ **Full Cycle Experience**

✅ **Is a Challenger Seller**

✅ **Entrepreneurial Spirit (get shit done mentality)**

✅ **Has grit, adaptability, and a strong work ethic**

✅ **Builder mentality - strong willingness to build, test, and execute**

✅ **High IQ**

Bonus one:

✅ **The Hunger Factor**

And then there's the top 1% that have the crazy factor, where they have a chip
on their shoulder.

Whatever goals you set for them, it's never enough. They're the ones who
usually double up with their peers whenever they're on a team. They are very
rare.

With your first hire(s) in place, you focus on creating a truly predictable
process with clear KPIs and conversion metrics. You need to understand factors

**HOW many prospects need to be entered into a cadence**

**⬇️**

**To generate HOW many discovery calls,**

**⬇️**

**To get how much pipeline and opportunities,**

**⬇️**

**To produce HOW much revenue in WHAT time**

You start to make your GTM predictable and can answer:

✅ Your MQL to SQL conversion rate

✅ Your SQL to customer conversion rate (deal win rate)

✅ Your sales cycle

✅ Your average contract value (ACV)

The more predictable it is, the greater the likelihood that the first sales
hire(s) will be successful. You can also develop [sales
methodologies](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/141701489/sales-qualification-
frameworks) that work for your specific business during this phase.

The goal is to come up with a sales forecast that allows you to exactly know
what you need to hit on a daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly basis to hit
your next revenue milestone. ([reverse engineering sales
plan](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/reverse-engineering-template-saas))

Once your process is repeatable and predictable, you can confidently bring on
additional salespeople who can succeed within your established framework.

→ Your goal is to have repeatability and predictability to scale.

The right time to hire a sales leader is when you already have a handful of
people on the sales team who are executing.

If you have 2, 3, or 4 account executives, 1, 2, 3, or 4 SDRs producing, then
it's very easy to attract a world-class sales leader.

But you, the founder/CEO stay the CRO, no matter what, always managing that
sales leader.

The critical insight here is that **by following this progression in order,
you become a competent sales leader yourself before hiring one**.

By the time you get to the point that you can hire a sales leader, you have a
good idea of what the job entails, and you'll know exactly what good
performance looks like because you've been doing the job.

And now you're going to be handing the reins over to a VP of Sales, but you're
going to ease out of that while they take over.

This phase is very risky, because you will be handing over and stepping away.
The natural tendency will be to step away completely, but that is not ideal
for the business.

Stay close to the VP Sales, manage them tightly, and be their teammate for a
long time.

The sales process of acquiring customers is the most enlightening search for
truth. Delaying or avoiding it only leads to more pain later on.

After each customer interaction, note what worked, what didn't, and what
questions arose. These notes become the foundation of your playbook.

Don't worry about scaling until you have a repeatable process. One repeatable
sales motion is worth far more than randomly closed deals.

Even after making your first sales hires, continue to run your own deals in
parallel. This keeps you connected to market reality.

Break down your sales process into discrete components (discovery call, demo,
objection handling) and document each separately.

Hire for exactly what you need today, not who could "eventually" become your
VP Sales.

Don’t waste time on leads that aren’t a fit. Establish a clear qualification
framework (like SPICED or MEDDIC) and stick to it.

You’re not “just” a salesperson — you’re the founder. Leverage that
credibility. Prospects will often open up more and give you direct feedback.

Use what you hear in sales to influence product decisions weekly.

Build your ‘[ask for
referrals/intros](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/159337165/bonus-section-
referral-playbooks-using-linkedin)’ muscle: “Who else should I talk to about
this?” Warm intros are gold.

We know this isn't what most founders want to hear.

Technical founders especially often hope to build a great product, hire
salespeople, and return to product development.

But embracing the permanent nature of founder-led sales isn't a burden—it's a
competitive advantage.

The founders who accept this reality build stronger companies, with more
resonant product roadmaps, more effective go-to-market strategies, and more
resilience during inevitable setbacks.

Coming into any of this thinking, "Hey, I'm going to figure out a way out of
sales" already sets up the business for failure.

It's natural to try to get out of sales. It's painful. The rejection is brutal
and honest. The prospect often does not want to exchange their money for your
value. But that reality and that truth are what keep the startup honest, keep
the revenue engine honest, keep the business honest.

And that's why a founder must be involved in the go-to-market motion via
founder-led sales for the entire existence of the startup.

The most successful founders made peace with their permanent role in sales.
They don't see it as a distraction from their "real job"—they recognize it as
an essential component of their real job.

After all, without revenue, nothing else in your startup matters.
