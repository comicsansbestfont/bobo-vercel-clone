Hey - it’s [Alex](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-estner/)!

If you’re a first-time founder going from 0 to 1 million ARR, it’s tough to
figure out your GTM, especially when there is so much information available
about what you should and shouldn’t do.

I’ve helped over 25 founders in the last three years who have gone through
this exact 0 to 1 stage, and therefore, I’m sharing **my top 9 GTM
Infographics** that are especially useful at this stage.

> _👉 It’s a mini GTM foundation masterclass with an expected reading time < 5
> minutes._

Let’s go through these one by one and fix your GTM.

Before you start with anything, it is important to unlearn and debunk a few
myths you might be believing as an early-stage founder.

Your first task is to identify which ones you’ve been believing in and debunk
them.

With the myths out of the way, the best place to start is to understand the
state of your current GTM.

❌ What is going wrong

✅ What is going right

💪 What do you need to double down on?

Answer all these questions using this 360° GTM Audit.

You need to check the health of your:

1️⃣ **GTM Strategy** \- These are your core foundational pillars. Until these
aren’t in place, no amount of GTM tactics is going to work for you.

E.g., if your ICP isn’t clear, you won’t know whom you’re selling to. In that
case, no amount of marketing is going to fix sales for you!

2️⃣ **GTM Execution** \- Once your strategy is in place, focus on execution to
take your startup to the next level.

You might think 0 to 1 mil ARR is just one stage. I believe there are 3.

1️⃣ **Hustle Mode** \- You’re trying to get your first 10/100 customers and
throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. This is your GTM
experimentation stage.

2️⃣ **Focus Mode** \- Now, you have to go beyond your first 10/100 customers,
and the only way to do this is by focusing on 1 ICP, 1 use-case, 1-2 channels.

Stages 1️⃣ and 2️⃣ combined are what I call the GTM Foundations.

3️⃣ **Expansion Mode** \- This is once you’ve hit Product-Market Fit (cleared
the previous two stages), and now, you’re ready for expansion!

The foundation of a strong GTM are 7 key elements.

1️⃣ ICP Clarity  
2️⃣ Positioning Clarity  
3️⃣ Messaging that resonates  
4️⃣ (Simple) pricing

5️⃣ 1-2 growth channels that drive the pipeline  
6️⃣ Repeatable sales motion  
7️⃣ Buyer Journey Clarity

Unless your foundations are in place, scaling to Expansion Mode will be
extremely difficult for you. Make sure you understand each pillar of your GTM
Foundation and take time to build it before you expand.

If you’re on your way to build GTM Foundations, use this checklist to know
what you need to develop and execute.

The goal here is to get to Product-Market Fit by making sure you have
established:

**PMF = Problem-Solution Fit + GTM Fit**

The first GTM Foundation, ICP, is where most misconceptions lie. So let’s
understand the key concepts of your ICP.

Your TAM is not your ideal customer profile. Especially if you’re VC-funded
and talk a lot about the HUGE market, it’s a common mistake.

Your TAM is something you will (eventually) win in 5+ years, but not today. So
live with the fact that your ICPs will change over time.

Think about it this way: Your ICP today brings you to your next milestone.

Once you hit the next milestone, you can revisit your ICP.

> customer-profile) to get clarity on your ideal customer.

As we saw above, the path to 1€ and then to 10€M ARR isn’t about maximizing
your total addressable market. It’s about dominating a specific segment.

When you focus on one specific segment:

✅ Your marketing message becomes crystal clear

✅ Your sales team becomes highly efficient

✅ Your product roadmap gets laser-focused

✅ Your customer success becomes predictable

✅ Your referrals start flowing naturally

Most importantly, you build deep expertise in solving specific problems for
specific customers. This expertise compounds over time, creating a moat that
competitors can’t easily cross. That is the power of niching down.

Here, it is important to understand that your early customers are not your
ICP; they are your ECP (Early Customer Profile). To get to your ICP from your
ECP, you need to:

1️⃣ Collect data of your customers

2️⃣ Break down your customer base into segments and

3️⃣ Analyze them against metrics that are indicators of ‘better fit’

We call them ‘‘better-fit’ Indicators (aka. Winning indicators).

Generally speaking, your ‘best-fit’ customers:

💪 have higher product engagement

💪 show better commercial metrics

💪 are less support-intensive

💪 are better aligned with your strategy and values/culture

What works for €500M+ ARR companies will kill your startup at €0-1M.

You don’t have the same data & resources (money, time & runway) they have.
