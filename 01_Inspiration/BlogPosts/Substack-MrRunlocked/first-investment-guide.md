Every startup needs financial resources to build a product and go to market.

But one of the key question that every founder (team) need to ask themselves
is:

> **“Do I need external capital or can I self-fund (aka. bootstrap) my
> business?”**

So, before we dive into how to get your first funding from angels and (pre-)
seed investors, we will give you a quick overview of when to raise vs. when to
bootstrap.

P.S. Work on your [positioning and
messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-gtm-foundation) before you reach
out to investors for external funding.

Let us start with an abstract definition of each term:

Building and growing a business using personal savings, reinvested profits, or
minimal external funding, relying on resourcefulness and cost efficiency
instead of significant external capital.

The process of securing external capital, often from angel investors, (pre-)
seed funds, or family offices, to support product development, market entry,
and initial early scaling.

Seed strapping is a start-up growth strategy where founders raise a single
(pre-) seed round to build momentum, then grow with revenue instead of chasing
more funding rounds. It’s the middle ground between bootstrapping and early-
stage fundraising.

The decision on what the right model for you depends on a set of variables:

✅ Growth ambition

✅ Market landscape/dynamics

✅ Business model & need for funding

✅ Ownership & control

✅ Preferred ‘lifestyle’

✅ Free cash flow / front-loaded payments

✅ Go-to-market and sales motion

If you decide to pursue external funding, it’s helpful to understand the
[‘funding journey’ from pre-seed to Series C](https://capvisory.de/the-
startup-funding-stages-from-pre-seed-to-series-c/).

But now, let’s have a closer look at the different early-stage funding
options.

Informal investment from people you know.

✅ Best for:

  * Idea-stage (pre-revenue) companies

  * When raising a small pre-seed round (<€250k)

  * Trusted personal networks

  * Kickstarting a company to get to MVP or early PMF

Wealthy individuals who are investing early (usually €10k–€100k per investor).

✅ Best for:

  * Founders needing smart money (advice + cash)

  * Start-ups with early traction or mass market potential

  * Founders with a strong network / large tech spin-offs (start-up Mafias)

**Tips** :

✅ Target angels who’ve built companies in a similar space or backed other SaaS
products in that niche (or industry experts).

✅ Add structure (CLA overpriced round) and angel pooling sub 50k € cheques.  

You usually have 2 options to structure your Business angels & angel
syndicates investment.

**Option 1: Pre-Seed Priced Equity Round**

Founders sell shares at an agreed valuation, giving investors immediate equity
ownership in the company.

**Pros:**

✅ Clear ownership structure from day one.

✅ No debt obligations or interest.

✅ Attracts investors seeking defined equity stakes.

✅ Reduces uncertainty around future valuations.

**Cons:**

❌ Dilution for founders occurs immediately.

❌ Valuation negotiation can be difficult at a very early stage.

❌ Legal and administrative costs are typically higher.

❌ Distracting the founders / time-consuming

**Option 2: Convertible Loan Investment (Convertible Note / CLA)**

A loan that converts into equity at a later funding round, often with a
discount or valuation cap, rather than being repaid in cash.

**Pros:**

✅ Faster, cheaper, and simpler to execute.

✅ Defers valuation discussion until later (when more traction exists).

✅ Provides flexibility for both founders and investors.

✅ Often includes investor-friendly incentives (discounts, caps, interest).

**Cons:**

❌ Creates debt on the balance sheet until conversion.

❌ Interest may accrue, increasing dilution at conversion.

❌ If no future round occurs, repayment obligations may arise.

❌ Misaligned incentives if terms heavily favor investors.

👉 Here are lists of active and trusted business angels:

These work with already formed founding teams that have at least an initial
idea or prototype.

They provide a structured program with mentoring, community, and resources to
help these teams sharpen their product, validate their market, and prepare for
fundraising.

In return for equity, they also offer early capital and access to a strong
investor and alumni network.

_Examples: Y Combinator, Techstars, TinySeed, On Deck, EWOR, PnP_

Talent Investors back individuals before they even have a company.

Instead of waiting for teams with a ready-made product, they select talented
people, bring them together in a structured program, and help them find co-
founders with complementary skills.

Within this environment, participants test and refine ideas, validate business
models, and, if they find traction, receive a first pre-seed investment.

_Examples: Antler, Entrepreneur First or MVP Founders._

What it is: Programs that offer small investments (€100k–€250k) plus
mentorship, community, and demo day exposure.

✅ Best for:

⏳ Typical Terms: 6–10% equity for access and cash

Early-stage venture capital funds write checks from €100k to €1m and above.

✅ Best for:

  * Large market opportunity (Large TAM)

  * Fast-scaling SaaS with traction / high usage

  * Founders ready for aggressive growth and fundraising cycles

  * Serial entrepreneurs and domain experts with particular intel

This path requires:

  * Clear path to 100x+ return (Min. expectation fund returner potential)

  * Willingness to give up board seats, control at a later point

👉 Here are lists of active VCs (in Europe):

Free “non-dilutive” grants from governments, NGOs, universities, or industry-
specific funding programs.

✅ Best for:

Be aware of long application processes and paperwork.

We recommend working with agencies that do the administrative stuff for you,
such as [Sector Pi](https://www.sectorpi.com/).

Here’s a short list of options:

Speedinvest also shared a list of [25 non-dilutive funding options for
startups](https://www.speedinvest.com/blog/non-dilutive-funding-for-startups-
all-across-europe) in Europe.

Now that we know the different funding options, let’s have a look at what you
need in 2025/2026 to raise money from business angels and early-stage VCs for
your pre-seed round.

P.S. In a bit later stages, some hybrid models might be a good fit for you,
e.g., revenue-based financing (above 1€ million ARR) or indie VC funding
(e.g., Atempo, Float, Re:Cap, etc.)

The funding landscape changed in the last 12 months. Here’s what Julius and
Marc observed over the last 12 months when it comes to raising a pre-seed and
seed round:

1️⃣ Fundraising takes much longer (expect 6-9 months)

2️⃣ Traction expectations ramped up, early traction is king

3️⃣ Most investments shifted into vertical AI (enabled) / SaaS / Agentic AI

4️⃣ Since Tech becomes a commodity, GTM and data are the new moats

5️⃣ Strong shift from hypergrowth to strong unit economic profitability

6️⃣ Capital efficiency becomes key (e.g., revenue per FTE)

7️⃣ Default alive mentality/founder mindset

8️⃣ Raise what you need and not what you can

This one is a bit harder to generalize, because every investor has their own
mindset when it comes to investment.

But overall, founders need 5 things to raise their first investment.

Investors want to see that founders have:

  * Identified a pain point that’s urgent, specific, and underserved

  * unique insight or unfair advantage (domain expertise, founder–market fit)

  * Killer must-have application instead of a nice-to-have application

  * Strong defensibility edge over competitors/incumbents

Ideally, the founders can tell a compelling story of how market shifts create
painful problems.

At the pre-seed and seed stages, unit economics are usually not a key
consideration. Instead, investors want to see good signals.

This includes ideally:

We know that’s a bit fluffy, so let’s have a look at some relevant funding
benchmarks.

Point 9 Partner Christoph Janz was the first one sharing ‘SaaS funding
napkins’ - the latest version is from 2023. 👇

There’s no Napkin for 2024 or 2025, but we believe that in the pre-seed stage,
the following is true:

✅ You need more than a prototype. Early revenue (even if small), usage
metrics, customer feedback, and possibly some paying customers.

✅ Investors are much less willing to accept “growth at all costs” without
showing early signs of efficient growth.

✅ Early signs of good net expansion (NRR) are highly welcomed

✅ Clear path to €1m ARR (defensible GTM strategy), including a reasonable
valuation lift-up between the pre-seed and seed round.

If you build in the biology/scientific space, the [Nucleus Capital
Napkin](https://medium.com/@nucleuscapital/made-with-biology-funding-
napkin-2024-nucleus-capital-01036aa6c8b0) gives a good overview.

TAM/SAM/SOM is important because VCs invest in scalability and outsized
returns.

A compelling market size story shows that, if the startup executes well, it
can grow into a category-defining company big enough to return the fund.

**Sizing the Opportunity**

  * **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** Shows the maximum revenue potential if the startup captured 100% of the market.

  * **SAM (Serviceable Available Market):** Narrows this to the segment realistically served by the startup’s product/service.

  * **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** Focuses on the share the startup can realistically win in the short-to-medium term.

→ This framework helps VCs assess whether the opportunity is large enough to
justify venture-scale returns.

P.S. Majd Alaily shared [3 practical ways to calculate your TAM: Bottom Up,
Top Down or Value Based](https://majdalaily.substack.com/p/how-to-size-your-
market-without-embarrassing).

**Return Potential**

Venture capital funds rely on a few big winners to deliver portfolio returns.

A startup must show the potential to scale into a **hundred-million or
billion-dollar company** , which is only possible if the TAM (and thus the
SAM/SOM) is sufficiently large.

→ VCs evaluate if you can be a potential fund returner for them. [Jason Lemkin
wrote a great guide](https://www.saastr.com/vcs-need-you-to-be-a-potential-
fund-returner-when-they-invest-but-after-expectations-there-are-more-nuanced/)
on this.

**Risk Assessment**

A small or poorly defined market increases the risk that even a great
team/product cannot achieve meaningful growth.

A clear TAM/SAM/SOM analysis reduces uncertainty about scalability and market
adoption.

**Strategic Fit**

Helps VCs understand if the startup’s go-to-market strategy (SOM) is realistic
and whether the business model can expand into larger segments (SAM, TAM) over
time.

When you’re raising your first VC investment, you’re most probably early and
don’t have a robust go-to-market in place.

What they want to see is that you think strategically about your GTM and do
lots of tests to see what works and what doesn’t.

They need to believe that you understand your [Ideal Customer
Profile](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile), work
on your unique positioning, develop a [strong
messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-
framework), and invest in the right sales motion and [growth channels
](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-21-saas-gtm-channels)\- aka. build a
[strong GTM foundation](https://www.alexestner.com/services/gtm-advisory).

They want to see early signals that you build a strong (founder-led) go-to-
market motion.

They will evaluate if:

1️⃣ The current team is skilled enough to run the different parts of the
company (product, tech, GTM)?

2️⃣ Your team is complementary and ready to execute without additional key
hires in the 0 to 1 period?

3️⃣ Do you have any unique skills in the team (e.g,. industry expertise, track
record…)

While we did some research on our guide, we found [another great

QG_9AzK_eyg) from Majd Alaily and Chris Tottman (from Notion Capital) on what
VCs actually look for and how they evaluate you.

So now you know what investors expect from you.

So let’s get a bit more tactical. The 3 most common questions we get are:

> _When is the right time to raise?_
>
> _How do I find the right investors?_
>
> _What documents do I need for fundraising?_

As we mentioned earlier, fundraising takes 6-9 months.

But keep in mind that fundraising also has its own seasonality, so summer
months and December/January are usually a stretch. If possible, don’t aim for
closing a round at that time.

Fundraising usually happens in two phases: a passive and an active one.

In the passive phase, founders start building relationships with a carefully
selected list of target investors 6-12 months before they officially open a
round. This means staying on their radar, sharing occasional but limited
updates, and creating familiarity without asking for money yet.

When the time comes to move into the active fundraising phase, these investors
already know the team and their progress, which builds trust and significantly
shortens decision cycles.

Done well, passive fundraising turns the later active phase from cold outreach
into warm, momentum-driven conversations.

Winning your first investors is a bit like winning your first clients. The
name of the game is volume after all.

Here are a few tactics to keep in mind:

✅ Start with all the angels / VCs you DON’T want to have to test your deck and
practice your pitch to refine it before you go for the real “gold nuggets”.

✅ Ask your inner network for introductions

✅ Try getting referrals and warm intros (a must)

✅ Focus on ‘high-fit’ and active investors

✅ Start early (passive fundraising) to build relationships (feed them with
monthly updates)

✅ Activate your cheerleaders (The angels you win are the best fundraisers)

✅ Send out deck and tailored outreach messages (touchpoints and why they are a
great fit based on their portfolio or focus)

But getting investors to a first call is just the first step of your
fundraising process.

It’s the same as sales. Usually, you don’t close a deal on your first call.

When you decide to start raising external money (from VCs and angels), you
need to prepare the right documents.

We recommend having:

  1. Short Intro Pitch Deck (6-10 slides)

  2. Longer Pitch Deck (10-20 slides + backlog slides)

  3. Data Room with a lot more insights (only shared after first conversations)

In his recent [LinkedIn

QG_9AzK_eyg), he shared what VCs actually want to see in your pitch deck 👇

Your data room is a shared folder/hub, where you store and share critical
company documents (e.g., financials, cap tables, GTM strategy, etc.) with
potential investors.

Andreas Mitschke provides a great [Notion data room

P.S. If you need hands-on support building your pitch deck and running an
effective fundraising process, consider the support from experts like [Nikola
Yanev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolayanev/) or [Matthias
Voss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mtthsvss/).

Let's add some thoughts around fundability and cap table hygiene - what are
acceptable dilution ranges and how should a cap table look (founder share /
ESOP / Advisor/investors) post pre-seed.

Even in pre-seed rounds, there is a broad range of pre- and post-money caps,
which may range between €3m and €20m, while the majority rather range between
€5m and €8m (pre-money cap).

Discounts are usually set at around 20%. Competitive cases may have a 15%
discount, while distressed start-ups may offer up to 30%.

Interest rates may range between 3% and 8%, upon conversion. Accrued interest
may have a high impact on overall dilution (based on the converting amount,
principal plus interest).

Some CLAs, as well, include a floor.**** A floor conversion sets a minimum
company valuation at which the loan will convert into equity.

In other words, even if a future financing round values the company very low,
the CLA will convert as if the valuation were at least the floor.

An optimal pre-seed cap-table has only the founders on it - in a perfect
world, there are two to three founders, all with a unique super power. A
single founder always bears a certain risk, and more than three founders lead
to low per-founder equity ownership and higher conflict potential in the
founding team.

An optimal post pre-seed cap-table leaves the founding team with at least 80%
of ownership, while up to 20% goes to investors, in addition to a 10% ESOP.

P.S. Cherry Ventures shared a [great article on the ‘cap table
magic’](https://medium.com/cherryventures/cap-table-magic-made-
easy-9a1cb56732eb).

There’s a lot of uncertainty about what a fair term sheet looks like.

Below you’ll find the [unveiled term sheet
template](https://medium.com/cherryventures/term-sheet-unlocked-c73f28bd15f7)
from Cherry Ventures.

After the term sheet, the closing follows.

Congrats, but the investor relationship is not over with the closing.

So let’s have a closer look at how you should manage your investor
relationship.

Don’t treat your first investors only as ‘money giver’ - they can bring a lot
more to the table and can be a smart ‘team extension’.

VERY important bilateral Background checks, get references about your
investors to get a feeling of what to expect from them (next to money). Always
opt for Intel / Access and Network Angels (every Angel should bring a
superpower)!

The great investors also want to help if you ask the right way.

Here’s a list of how investors can support you:

Most Investors have a great network. Leverage this:

  * Intros to other investors (future rounds)

  * Intros to potential hires, advisors, or agencies

  * Intros to potential (early) customers

They can be your sounding board for:

Think about the following:

  * Add their name/logo on your deck

  * Add them to your website (about us page) for social proof

  * Ask them to add you to their website and/or promote on their social accounts

Most VCs/angels have already backed other successful companies. So they know
your challenges.

Don’t hesitate to ask for their help, e.g.:

However, don’t forget that you are most likely not their only investment.

So be specific when you **ask for their help**.

>   * _“Do you know a good designer who can help us with our new website?”_
>
>   *  _“Who can help us build our GTM foundation?”_
>
>   *  _“We hire 1 new full-stack engineer and 1 senior account executive. Do
> you know a good fit?”_
>
>   *  _“Can you introduce us to a few companies that might be a good ICP fit.
> We thought about X and Y - I saw you worked for them in the past.”_
>
>   *  _„I am preparing our Seed Pitch Deck and heard that the TAM, SAM, SOM
> logic is outdated at Investors. What’s your take?“_
>
>   *  _„Who should be my first sales hire?“_
>
>   *  _„My sales cycles are way too long. How can I fasten my closing?“_
>
>

The founders who get the most out of their investors are the ones who:

✅ Send short, focused updates

✅ Ask for specific help

Once you have investors on board, they expect monthly update emails.

A good monthly update email is short, structured, honest, and easy for
investors to scan, understand, and help.

✅ Consistent structure (same format every month)

✅ Typical sections are: Highlights, Lowlights/challenges, Key Metrics, Asks

✅ Easy to read (no fluff, no super detailed explanations)

**Below you find an example of a good update email.**

**❌ Pitching too early (without real traction)**

Raising before you have enough proof points (revenue, users, engagement) makes
it hard to convince serious investors.

**👉** Avoid by validating your product and showing early traction before
starting the fundraising process.

**❌ Too many iterations (product, model…) within the fundraising**

Constantly changing your story or business model during a raise signals
uncertainty and a lack of focus.

**👉** Avoid by testing, refining, and locking in your narrative before going
to market.

**❌ The founding team is changing within fundraising**

Team changes mid-fundraise trigger red flags about stability, culture, and
execution risk.

**👉** Avoid by ensuring founder alignment and resolving team issues well
before approaching investors.

**❌ Over promise and under deliver**

Overambitious projections and missed milestones kill credibility quickly.

👉 Avoid by being realistic in forecasts and communicating transparently if
challenges arise.

**❌ Not running a tight/clear fundraising process**

A messy, drawn-out process makes you lose momentum and investor interest.

👉 Avoid by defining a clear timeline, focus enough time on fundraising.

**❌ Raising “just to raise” with no use-of-funds clarity**

Investors want to know how their money creates value, not just extend runway.

👉Present a clear use-of-fund. Know why you need the money

**❌ Not understanding investor expectations**

Not understanding what investors want to achieve with their fund

👉Research fund size, check sizes, and understand fund returner expectations

**❌ Spamming ‘all’ investors without personalization**

Sending the same generic email to hundreds of investors shows a lack of
preparation.

👉 Avoid by tailoring outreach to each investor’s focus and explaining the fit
+ leverage warm intros

**❌ Shortage of time**

Running out of runway while raising forces bad deals and desperate decisions.

👉 Avoid by starting the process at least 6–9 months before you need the
capital.

**❌ Weak pitch deck with lots of fluff**

Pitch deck with lots of jargon and missing the most crucial information

👉 Follow our pitch deck template (shared earlier)

Now you know how to raise your first investment.

Happy growth 🚀
