Before we dive into LinkedIn Sales Navigator, let’s talk about why you should
use it.

LinkedIn is the biggest B2B database in the world. Over 1 billion contacts and
millions of companies are on the platform.

The chance that your [ICP](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-
customer-profile) is on the platform is quite high.

This makes it a goldmine for sales and [social
selling](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/9-linkedin-social-selling-tactics).

On a high level, LinkedIn Sales Navigator allows you to:

1️⃣ Find your (ideal) potential customers

2️⃣ Get their contact information

3️⃣ Track signals & engage on LinkedIn with them

It’s like having a magnet to attract the right leads—if you know how to use
it.

This guide breaks it down into 9 chapters. Step by step, you’ll learn what
matters, not just what to click.

By the end, you’ll know how to find and connect with decision-makers who need
what you offer.

Throughout this guide [Arnaud](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnaud-
renoux-129aa949/) and [I](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-estner/) share
a lot of screenshots of our LinkedIn Sales navigator - so you will see how we
both target different people.

LinkedIn Sales Navigator is the biggest B2B database and a goldmine for sales.

Here’s a quick, high-level overview of what you can do with it:

  1. Search for **people** based on 30+ filters

  2. Search for **specific companies** based on 15+ filters

  3. Save searches and **get new leads** on autopilot (that match these filters)

  4. Add people & companies to a custom list (to keep track of them)

  5. Track signal/ Monitor their **engagement/activity** (to know when to reach out)

  6. Get **warm intros** via your network

  7. **Export leads** for sales activity

LinkedIn Sales Navigator allows you to search for these 2 ‘data objects’:

**1️⃣ Persons/Contacts (aka. Leads)**

**2️⃣ Companies (aka. Accounts)**

You can also combine both, e.g. search for people within the companies you
filtered.

We have structured the guide such that -

Chapter 1 to Chapter 4 will focus on individuals - while Chapter 5 to Chapter
7 on accounts.

In the upcoming 9 chapters, we will show you how you can do lead searches and
also account searches (and of course, how to mix both to get the most out of
it).

Let’s dive into it.

To find the right people using Sales Navigator, you must have your (first
version / best guess) [ICP](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-
customer-profile) ready. This includes:

✅ Job Titles

→ e.g. a list with “Head of Sales”, “Director of Sales”, “VP of Sales” or “Co-
Founder”, “Founder”

✅ Company Industry

→ e.g. a list with “Software Development” and “Technology, Information and
Internet”

✅ Company Size

→ e.g. from 10-50 employees

✅ Location (Company and/or person)

→ e.g. “Germany”, “Austria” and “Switzerland”

and other criteria that might be relevant to you.

💡Don’t have your ICP? Use our [ICP framework
template](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile).

Building your first lead search on Sales Navigator? The filters might feel
overwhelming.  
Think of them like describing your ideal customer to a friend.

The more details you give, the better LinkedIn can find the right people for
you.

One of the first filters you’ll see is Company Headcount—and for a good
reason.

Purpose - A company’s size tells you:

  * How much budget they might have

  * How complex their needs are

  * Who makes buying decisions

  * What challenges they might face

**How to Use It:**

  1. Find Company Headcount at the top of your filters

  2. Click it to see the options

  3. Choose from Self-Employed to 10,000+ employees

  4. Sales Navigator will show you how many companies fit each size (once your other filters are applied)

Purpose - Finding the right companies in the right places.

You have the right size of companies; now, let’s narrow them down with
location using the geography filter below company size.

There are 2 ways to target companies:

##### 1\. Company HQ Location

Especially important if you target companies based in specific regions.
Excluding specific regions you don’t want to target is a good idea for most
startups.

The Company HQ info tells you where the budget is controlled and decisions
happen.

##### 2\. Employee Location

It tells you where the person is located. This might be different from the HQ
location (especially with remote work).

In a**lead** search,**employee location** is highly recommended.

**How to Use it:**

  1. Click Geography

  2. Type your main market (e.g., United States)

  3. You can also add key business hubs (New York, SF Bay Area, Chicago, etc.)

💡 Pro Tip: If you want to narrow your location to a specific town or
neighborhood in a city, use the postal code.  

Let’s say you want to target one or multiple areas in Manhattan in New York
City.  

Apply one or multiple into your Geography filter

PS: Keep in mind that some great prospects might work remotely in another
city.

Purpose - Finding companies that need you

Filtering by Industry helps you focus on companies that need your
product/service instead of wasting time on bad-fit leads.

Based on your ICP, industry can be a hard ICP criterion (e.g. vertical SaaS
for specific industry) or if you target multiple industries, it might make
sense to build a different list for each industry. That way, you can build
highly relevant messages.

Different industries have different Needs, Pain Points, Budgets, and Decision-
making speeds.

Knowing what industry(ies) need your product/service will help to:

**How to use it:**

  1. Find the industry filter

  2. Select 2-3 industries that match your best customers

For the example, we selected 2 industries:  
\- Software Development  
\- Technology, Information and Internet

💡Pro Tip: To improve the quality of your lead search, I suggest avoiding
selecting too many industries—stay focused. Better to build different searches
per industry (in case you target different ones).  

Take into consideration that each industry has its own particularities:

  * **Tech Startups:** Fast-moving, budget-conscious, open to new tools

  * **Finance & Banking:** High budgets, slow decisions, trust is key

  * **Healthcare:** Compliance-heavy, risk-averse, needs proven solutions

  * **E-commerce & Retail:** ROI-driven, willing to test new tech

  * **Manufacturing:** Traditional, cost-focused, slow to adopt new tech

Purpose - Find the people who make buying decisions.

Not everyone in a company has the power to say yes, but many can say no—which
is why targeting both decision-makers and influencers is key.

Use the “Current job title” filter and enter job titles that match decision-
makers and influencers.

You have 2 options to write the “Current job title” you’re targeting.

##### Option 1- Using Boolean (“Head of Sales”)

Using Boolean in LinkedIn Sales Navigator helps you refine results with
precise keyword combinations, allowing you to target the right prospects more
accurately.

LinkedIn Boolean comes with 4 core concepts:

  1. AND - combine 2 keywords (e.g. CEO AND Founder)

  2. OR - it’s either or (e.g. “Sales Director” OR “VP of Sales”

  3. NOT - to exclude terms (e.g. NOT Assistant)

  4. Quotes “ “ - search for exact term (e.g. “Purchasing Manager”)

##### Option 2- Not using Boolean (Head of Sales)

What’s the difference? Option 2 will provide significantly more results than
Option 1.  

However, the Boolean search on Head of Sales will be a lot more targeted
(meaning fewer irrelevant prospects).

We recommend using Boolean search to get only contacts that match exactly
these roles.

(You can also exclude specific roles).

Here’s an example of how this might look if you target Sales Leaders.

And if you also want to target Influencers (they research and recommend tools)
or even the users (to go bottom up), that might look the following.

💡Pro Tip: If you're unsure who makes the final call, start with influencers.
They often introduce vendors to decision-makers.

P.S. Keep in mind that you can also use the search bar of Boolean Searches,
but the search bar scans multiple fields (including job title, summary, and
profile text), so results may include profiles where the job title appears in
other sections.

Purpose - Targeting people based on “signals”

By now, we’ve filtered contacts by::

  * Industry,

  * Company Size,

  * Title,

  * Location,

That’s great, but you still might end up with a list of 1000+ contacts.

The good thing is that LinkedIn has some great filters built in that help you
identify ‘ready to buy’ people (or at least a signal that they have a higher
probability of being a good fit).

This includes:

✅ Following your company

✅ Viewed your profile recently

✅ Changed job

While the first 2 are great buying intent signals, chances are high these are
just a few (but go for them!).

Let's refine your list even more.

Targeting newly hired decision-makers is a smart move.  

They:

✅ Have fresh budgets

✅ Want to make an impact

✅ Are open to new solutions

##### “Changed jobs” filter

This shows people hired in the last 90 days—prime candidates for outreach.

Why does this work?

New hires are evaluating:

  * Current tools—what stays, what goes

  * New goals—fresh strategies and priorities

  * Vendors—open to better solutions

💡Pro Tip: If a company is hiring, they likely have a budget.

Now we have made a lot of examples of how you can use the different filters.

Here’s a lead search that I would do targeting early-stage SaaS founders in
Europe (responsible for the GTM side).

Your lead search is built. Now, make it work for you—automatically.

Saved searches turn Sales Navigator into a 24/7 prospecting assistant.  

It constantly finds new leads that match your criteria.

**How to save a search?:**

1\. Click "Save search" at the top left

2\. Name your search clearly (so you recognize it later)

Good search names include:

  * Job title (e.g., Head of Sales)

  * Region (e.g., NYC (USA)

  * Company size (e.g., Mid-Market)

  * Industry (e.g. Tech)

  * Connection Degree

Example: "Head of Sales - NYC (USA) - Mid-Market - Tech"

Keep your searches fresh -

Saved searches aren’t set-and-forget.  

They need regular updates to stay useful.

Monthly Check-up:

Quarterly Audit:

  * Which searches bring the best leads?

  * Are any searches outdated?

  * Do you need to create new ones?

Finding great prospects is just the first step. Now, you need a system to keep
track of them.

Using Lists can be a good way to keep your contacts organized.

If and how you use them depends on your overall tech stack.

You now have different options:

1) Add contacts from list/searches to your CRM and/or Sales engagement tools
(e.g. Lemlist) → We will cover this in chapter 8.

2) Use Lists and Sales Navigator as your personal CRM  

**How lead lists work:**

Each time you find a promising prospect, add them to a list.  

Sales Navigator will track their activity for you.  

This means you’ll always know:

More insights = Better timing for outreach.

  1. Run a lead search for your ideal prospects

  2. Select promising leads using checkboxes:

And yes, this step is manual. You need to select the profiles that are
relevant to you. The better your search, the fewer ‘irrelevant’ people you
will find, and the easier it will be to add ICP people to your lists.

  3. Click "Save to list" at the top. Choose an existing list or create a new list.

How you organize your lists depends on how intensively you’re using LinkedIn
as your main sales tool.

Here’s a system that might work for you, too:

Not all leads are equal. Use separate lists to stay focused.

##### List 1: New Prospects (Fresh Leads)

  * People you haven’t contacted yet

  * Recently added from saved searches

  * Decision-makers just identified

##### List 2: Active Conversations (Engaged Leads)

  * Prospects who replied

  * People showing interest

  * Ongoing discussions

💡Pro Tip: Review your lead lists weekly. Move leads between lists based on
their engagement.

Timing is Everything.

The difference between cold outreach and a real conversation? Timing.

We won’t discuss sales triggers in detail or how to use them. (Also, a
newsletter on signal-based/Allound prospecting will be released in the next
few weeks.)

Today, we focus on 5 key triggers that you can track natively in Sales
Navigator. These triggers will help you spot the perfect moment to contact
someone.

  1. Job Changes

  2. LinkedIn activity

  3. Viewed your profile

  4. Following your company

  5. Shared Connection & Experiences

.

A new job is a fresh start. New hires need to prove themselves—and often need
new solutions to do it.

LinkedIn gives you 2 options:

  1. It’s a dedicated section in your lead lists

  2. Filter in a new Lead search (described previously above)

Click their profile and evaluate what’s new.

Types of job changes and why they matter:

  * Promotions → Bigger responsibilities, fresh budgets, new goals

  * Company Changes → New environment, urgent challenges, need quick wins

  * Internal Moves → Knows the company, has influence, understands decision-making

💡Pro Tip: Don’t wait until the end of the 90 days to reach out. Do it as early
as possible.

Your prospects show you what matters to them.

How can you find active prospects (on a lead search + list):

  1. Use the "Posted on LinkedIn" filter  

In a lead search:

  2. Look for posts in the last 30 days in a lead list: 

  3. Read their content carefully

  4. Identify patterns in their interests

What to look for:

  * Questions they’re asking → Shows their current priorities

  * Problems they’re discussing → Hints at pain points you can solve

  * Articles they share → Reveals topics they care about

  * Comments they make → Insights into their mindset

  * Achievements they post → Perfect reason to congratulate & engage

💡Pro Tip: Engage with them before you connect with them. Comment a few times
on their posts to get on their radar.

Some leads already know who you are—these are your easiest conversations.

How to find them:

Use the "Buyer Intent" filter and select:

  1. Following Your Company → Prospects already interested in your brand

  2. Viewed Your Profile Recently → People who checked you out (they’re curious!)

💡Pro Tip: Reach out within 24 hours of a profile view—it’s when interest is
highest.

People are more likely to engage when there’s a warm connection or clear
interest. Sales Navigator helps you find these opportunities.

**Leverage shared connections to warm intros:**

Use the "Best Path In" filter and select:

  1. Connections of → Find leads connected to people in your network

  2. Past Colleagues → Target people who worked at the same company as you

  3. Shared Experiences → Identify mutual groups, schools, or industries

💡Pro Tip: Mention your shared connection in your first message. It builds
instant trust.

Sales Navigator has notifications, so every time a contact that fits your ICP
views your profile, you get a notification. Yes, that's a signal that you can
use to reach out at the right time.

**Example of a LinkedIn message:**
* * *

_"Hey [Name], saw you checked out my profile—curious what caught your eye?"_

_"Hey [Name], I saw that you checked out my profile. Just curious—are you
looking for [desired outcome], or are you just enjoying my content?"_
* * *

LinkedIn](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/155327506/tactic-run-campaigns-with-
warm-leads).

Until now, we have focused on ‘individual’ searches.

Now, let’s have a look at ‘company’ searches - aka. ABM-specific chapter.

In Chapter 1-4 our approach was to find the relevant people directly. In the
next few chapters, we will focus on accounts first and then finding the right
people within those accounts.

This approach is great for account-based marketing (ABM) - meaning if you have
a specific list of target companies.

So let’s dive into it.

In this approach, instead of looking for decision-makers, you’re searching
for:

✅ Companies that match your ICP (see chapter 0) - industry, size, location

and ideally:

✅ Companies with the budget to buy

✅ Businesses in growth mode

Once you lock in the right companies, finding the right people inside them is
easy.

Let’s look at the account filters you can use to come up with your list of
target accounts -

Purpose - Revenue tells you who can afford your solution.

**How to use it:**

  1. Open Account Filters and find ‘annual revenue’ at the top

  2. Choose a range that fits your pricing

Companies spend 1-5% of their revenue on software and services.

💡 Pro Tip: The bigger the revenue, the longer the sales cycle—adjust your
approach.

Obvious - you most probably (and hopefully) target a specific segment of the
market.

Headcount (together with revenue) is a good criterion to filter.

Example: I work with early-stage SaaS founders from pre-seed to series A - so
they should have less than 50 employees (most even under 10).

Growth = More budget, more urgency, more demand.

Here are the 3 key growth indicators -

##### 1/ Company headcount growth:

Hiring fast = Expansion = Buying potential

Use "Company headcount growth" filter:

##### **2/ Department headcount growth**

More headcount = More tools needed  
Select the type of department you’re working with (Sales, IT, Marketing etc…)  

##### **  
3/ Hiring Trends**

Job posts reveal priorities

  * Click on “Job Opportunities”

  * Use "Currently Hiring" filter

  * Understand what companies are expanding

💡Pro Tip: A company hiring in your target department is likely shopping for
solutions.

We’ve talked about timing. These activities are great trigger events to reach
out -e.g. new funding or leadership changes.

We talked about this already on the lead searches. You can get very specific
here:

Your first search won’t be perfect. So keep refining your searches.

For every search you create:

Step 1: Review Results

Step 2: Fine-tune criteria

The goal? A high-quality list of companies primed for outreach.

Same as we did for people, we can do with companies.

Account lists help you track opportunities, manage territories, and stay
ahead.

**We recommend building multiple lists (aka. segments) for your account
lists.**

  1. **Territory-based lists**

In case you already have a few sellers, it’s a great way to separate accounts
and manage different regions.

Why does it work:

  * Helps with regional trends & priorities

  * Easier to manage time zones & outreach

  * Aligns with territory quotas & team structures

How to set it up:

  2. **Industry-based lists**

Another way to group companies (can work on top of territory).

  * Different industries = Different pain points

  * Helps craft better outreach messages

  * Aligns with industry events & cycles

**How to organize it:**

  * Create a list for each major industry you target

  * Add sub-industries (e.g., Healthcare → MedTech, Hospitals)

  * Group industries with similar buying behaviors

  3. **Strategic Account Lists (Focus on Big Wins)**

Some accounts are too valuable to treat like the rest. Here are a few ideas:

✅ Top 20 Target Accounts → Your dream clients

  * High-value, perfect-fit customers

  * Companies with long-term potential

  * Strategic accounts for big deals

✅ Competitive Opportunities → Companies using competitors

✅ Growth Opportunity Accounts → Fast-scaling businesses

💡 Pro Tip: Fast-growing companies buy fast—get in early.

Okay, now you have your list of accounts. But we need to engage with people,
not accounts.

So let’s have a look at how you find the right people within those accounts.

  1. **Combined Lead & Account Search**

LinkedIn enables you to combine both searches. So you can create a lead list
based on the existing account list.

Here’s how:

  * Go to a lead search

  * Go to Workflow

  * Select “Account lists”

  2. **Understanding company structure**

As you know, every B2B sale involves multiple roles.  

Knowing who does what helps you target the right people.

  * Economic Buyer → Controls the budget

  * Technical Buyer → Evaluates the solution

  * User Buyer → Uses it daily

  * Champion → Pushes for your solution internally

Open a company profile in Sales Navigator and click “All Employees”

This tab shows all the people working in this company, including the info
about:

> Again, if you’re unsure who to target, look for:

  3. **Relationship Explorer**

Another way is to analyze your target accounts using the ‘relationship
explorer’.

Okay by now, you know how to build your list of contacts and/or companies. Now
it’s time to start ‘selling’ and reaching out to them.

Of course, there is not only one way to reach out to contacts. This guide is
not about how the different ways work, but it’s important to mention because
it’s part of how you use LinkedIn Sales Navigator.

So let’s give you a quick overview:

1️⃣ Connect (manually) via LinkedIn

That’s the most obvious way. Simply click on ‘connect’ - with or without text.

2️⃣ Run ‘auto’ connect campaigns via LinkedIn

We talked about this in a different episode. You can use tools like
[Lemlist](https://get.lemlist.com/0rxvigavj545), Heyreach, or
[Expandi](https://expandi.io/?red=alexanbeecd1) to [send 150 connection
requests per week](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/155327506/tactic-run-
campaigns-with-cold-leads).

3️⃣ Run (multi-channel) outbound campaigns

LinkedIn is not the right tool to run your (automated)[ multi-channel outbound
campaigns](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/139777012/the-steps-of-a-powerful-
linkedin-prospecting-sequence-tppssb-framework). For this, you need to export
leads and enrich them (e.g., getting their email address or phone number).

or, of course, sometimes you just want to:

4️⃣ Import them to your CRM

Tools like [Surfe](https://www.surfe.com/) make this quite easy.

5️⃣ Export as CSV

Tools like [Scalelis](https://scalelist.com/)t (or Evaboot) are helpful here.

Your research is done. Now, it’s time to move your leads into action.

Sales Navigator doesn’t let you export directly. Tools like
[Scalelist](https://scalelist.com/) make it easy.

An "Export Leads" button appears in the Sales Navigator:

Click on “Export 11 leads” and get your list of leads.

Now it’s time to get their contact details.

Here’s a list of tools you can use:
[Lemlist](https://get.lemlist.com/0rxvigavj545) (with waterfall enrichment),
[Findymail](https://www.findymail.com/?via=startupbusinesstips),
[Bettercontact](https://bettercontact.rocks?fpr=alexander19), Evaboot, and, of
course, [Scalelist](https://scalelist.com/).

Accurate emails = Higher reply rates.

But finding and verifying them takes the right process.

[Scalelist](https://scalelist.com/) automatically finds and verifies
professional emails & phone numbers.

Not all emails are equal. Here’s how to interpret the results.

  * The mail server is active

  * The formatting is correct

  * Mailbox exists

  * High delivery probability

  * Could be catch-all domains

  * Might be temporary emails

  * Hard to verify conclusively

20-30% of risky emails are actually valid.

The last step is to export your verified data. In the case of Scalelist, your
export will include 14 data points:

1- Sales Nav URL  
2- LinkedIn URL  
3- First Name  
4- Last Name  
5- Title  
6- Company Name  
7- Company Size  
8- Industry  
9- Location  
10- Premium Account Status  
11- Company Website  
12- Email (if found)  
13- Verification Status (Valid, Risky, etc.)  
14- Phone Number (if available)

We know this guide is already quite long. But we want to share with you 3
awesome LinkedIn playbooks.

In a previous episode, we talked about how to do proper [referral
sales](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/142204107/end-of-your-discovery-and-demo-
call). You can use every touchpoint with a prospect/customer to get warm
intros.

It depends on how you ask for it.

We recommend to following 2 steps:

  * Step 1: Ask an open question: “Who do you think could benefit from our product?”

  * Step 2: In case they don’t know anyone, be prepared and say “I had a quick look at your LinkedIn network before our call and I saw that you’re connected to X, Y, Z who I believe would benefit a lot from our product - How is your connection with them?”

So, that’s where LinkedIn comes in. Prepare for your calls and scan their
network for ICP-fits.

You tap into the network of your closed group (e.g. investors, employees,
partners, friends) and scan their connections for ICPs. Then you will create a
shortlist of people you want to get connected to and share the list with your
closed group and ask them for introductions.

Same play as above. You search for relevant connections of your customers, and
once you find a shortlist of relevant people, you can ask them for an intro.

P.S. This works also the other way around. This means that if you’re on a
profile of a person you’re NOT connected with, Sales Navigator gives you a
list of people who could make an intro for you.

Now you know how to use LinkedIn Sales Navigator, but here are some helpful
additional resources:
