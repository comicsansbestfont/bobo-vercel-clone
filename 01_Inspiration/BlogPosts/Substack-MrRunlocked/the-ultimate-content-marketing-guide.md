Content marketing is an indiscussible channel for early-stage B2B startups. It
can drive results across the whole funnel — brand awareness, acquire leads,
revenue, and even expansion — while making acquisition organic and scalable,
which is what every VC seeks.

Content should be among your first channels as an early-stage SaaS. Once
you’ve developed the foundation of your [product marketing
messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-
framework), content is the first avenue to help you articulate that into a
compelling narrative.

Yes, [outbound](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-best-outbound-tech-stack)
should also be among your first channels, as it’s mostly free, highly
scalable, and provides faster feedback loops than content.

However, in B2B you’re selling to professionals; and no professional or
company will buy from someone they don’t trust. Content is a unique avenue
that lets you show your audience you’re an expert in what you're selling.
Differently from [ads](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/how-to-get-started-with-
linkedin) or [outbound](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-best-outbound-tech-
stack), content helps you project confidence in your prospects, helping them
build a relationship of affinity so that when the time is right, they’ll trust
you with their money, and choose you over
[competitors](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/3-types-of-competition).

To this day, the cheapest and most scalable content starts in written form,
especially thanks to [AI which gave us “infinite
labor”](https://andrewchen.substack.com/p/ai-and-marketing-what-happens-
next?utm_source=post-email-
title&publication_id=2401262&post_id=144673032&utm_campaign=email-post-
title&isFreemail=true&r=2rm42&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email). But where
AI solves for execution, the strategy gap remains wider than ever.**** Most
startups we advise struggle with content strategy.

**Common pitfalls include:**

❌ Not investing in product marketing ahead of content,

❌ Inconsistent production and distribution,

❌ Over-reliance on AI-generated content that drives volume but lacks depth and
taste.

But above all, one of the biggest mistakes we see is that we need to figure
out where to start with content.

_**“We should talk about our vision”, “Let’s do a series about the key
customer pain points”, or “We need to target these high-volume keywords”.**_

More often than not, these mistakes are rooted in the founders’ inner
conviction and vision, because they hire junior marketers on their first
rodeo; or because even when they hire senior experts, they discard their
advice (yes, this happens all the time!).

How can your startup overcome these
[pitfalls](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-10-most-common-gtm-myths) and
develop an effective content marketing strategy that delivers tangible
results?

In this post, we’ll go beyond the cookie-cutter advice like “you must know
your audience”. We’ll devise a strategy process intertwined with product
marketing by defining your buyer’s stages of awareness, selecting your best
starting point for content production, and then sharing how to build robust
content programs using both human writers and AI.

Before writing content, you must invest in product marketing.

Product marketing is the strategic foundation that defines your TAM and
[target personas](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-
profile) (aka. Ideal Customer Profile), analyzes their goals, the
alternatives/competitors they’re using to achieve them, and the problems
arising from them; helping you “message” and
“[position](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-positioning-6-different-ways)”
your company as a compelling solution.

We see many founders and teams under-indexing in product marketing,
tremendously diluting their content. Product marketing comes before content;
if you skip it, you’ll just have weaker messaging, weaker content, and more
confused prospects.

So if you haven’t invested in product marketing, you might not be ready for
this guide. Instead, check out these resources:

Now that you’ve set your product marketing foundation and are ready to
confidently articulate your value proposition in a language relatable to your
ICP, you need to map your awareness stages.

The [Stages of
Awareness](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anthonypierri_productmarketing-saas-
startups-activity-7198321601585569792-rHpG) is a framework built by Anthony
Pierri that helps you understand the level of awareness your customers have
towards the outcome they’re trying to achieve with your product. FYI, this is
not content, but product marketing.

For example, Anthony used the B2B gift-sending platform Sendoso to explain the
framework. Let’s go through it in a bit more detail.

At this stage,**** prospects are aware of different potential outcomes they
want to achieve. Outcomes as intended here refers to the [JTBD definition
according to Bob Moesta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQV7HVyAJjc) — the
process a consumer goes through when they aim to change their existing
situation into a preferred one, but cannot do so because of
[constraints](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-s-the-definition-of-job-t-
M_1YeTULQQKdT5RPFVd9lw) that stop them.

In the case of Sendoso:

👉 Maybe they want to focus on making their sales team happier at work.

👉 Maybe they want to make their teams more productive overall.

👉 Maybe they want to close more deals.

This is typical of a prospect that is in the earliest stages of their
purchasing decision and/or in new markets — they know what they want to
achieve, but are not aware of how to do it or which solutions are out there.

Instead, they are battling against “the old/current way” of doing things,
because they’re not aware of a “new way” (well, that could be you!).

Once a prospect has picked their outcome, they start evaluating different
things they could do to achieve that goal. These options reflect the next
stage of awareness, where customers are shifting to explore solutions to
achieve their outcomes, according to [Anthony Ulwick’s definition of
JTBD](https://anthonyulwick.com/jobs-to-be-done/).

In the example of Sendoso:

👉 Maybe they want to focus on training their team in new sales methodologies.

👉 Maybe they want to create new sales enablement material.

👉 Or maybe they want to start sending gifts to prospects during the sales
process.

Let's assume they decide to go with sending gifts to prospects as the key use
case.

Once they've chosen a use case, they need to figure out the best product
category that will allow them to send gifts to customers. They start debating
between:

👉 eGift card platforms

👉 Branded merch platforms

👉 and gift-sending platforms.

Each of these product categories will help them accomplish the use case but in
very different ways, depending on their product capabilities, features, and
related benefits. This awareness stage is typical of the middle stages of the
purchasing funnel, but also of mature markets where customers are already
aware of the existing product categories to solve specific issues. Ultimately,
they decide to go with gift-sending platforms.

Now that they’ve committed to a product category, they evaluate different
alternatives of gift-sending platforms to compare each feature and
functionality to see which one best fits what they need to be able to do until
they make a purchasing decision. They check out Reachdesk, Postal, and
Sendoso.

Depending on the [growth model](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/product-led-vs-
sales-led-saas-growth) of your company, they will:

👉 **PLG** : sign up for trials of these products, and compare capabilities
against them.

👉 **Sales-led** : book demos and go through the sales process to compare
pitches and prices.

After completing their research of competitive alternatives, they commit to
the purchase decision. Again, depending on the motion of your company, they
will:

👉 **PLG** : upgrade to a paid plan.

👉 **Sales-led** : sign a contract.

**Note** : In the real world, some stages of awareness might be mixed or have
different orders. The awareness stages, like every other framework, attempt to
make complex real-life scenarios more linear and simple. This prescribes that
each prospect is 100% clear about the outcomes they want to achieve, their use
cases, the product categories to help them do so, and each provider. However,
only some prospects have perfect clarity or perfect knowledge of the market;
and on the other hand, only some companies know how to portray themselves
against competitors. That shows how critical product marketing can be in
helping prospects to make the right choice.

By the end of this section, you should have mapped out your awareness stages
for every potential outcome your company can help with. Based on that, you can
work back the related use cases product features, and related categories.

For example, in the case of [Cello](https://cello.so/):

The stages of awareness are great for mapping out your key product marketing
messages and contextualizing them to your customer journey. You can use these
not just to reverse engineer a compelling content map, but also to understand
where to start devising your content programs.

As mentioned above, most marketers and advisors will tell you:

“Start creating BOFU (bottom of the funnel) content.”

In our opinion, it’s not that easy, but it depends on the awareness stages of
your prospect and the [maturity of your
market](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anthonypierri_product-positioning-
consists-of-four-elements-
activity-7206294103263698945-F5a3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

**Mature market 👉 start from Product Awareness**.

If you’re in an established market with multiple competitors, you need to
convince your market [your product is the best in your
category](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anthonypierri_productmarketing-
saas-b2b-activity-7217165865434144768-iKY2/).

Start a content program around your players in your category and purchase
decisions. If your competitors have high traffic, you’ll also piggyback from
prospects searching for their brand name. We’ve listed below a list of content
pages you should start with. In the example of Cello, that’d mean creating
comparison pages with their competitors or boasting about why Cello is a
superior alternative for their target segments.

**Emerging market 👉 start from Product Category Awareness**.

If you’re in an emerging market and your product category is rising as a
better way to reach an outcome, you need to convince your market your product
category is the go-to alternative. For example, in the case of Cello which is
targeting founders looking to scale their organic acquisition, they might want
to create a program around why a user referral program is the best way to do
so compared to other alternatives like SEO or outbound.

**New market 👉 start from Use Case Awareness**.

If you’re building an innovative product or starting a new market, there might
be no direct competitor and you might be battling against “the old way of
doing things”. For example, that could be doing things on spreadsheets,
manually, etc. In this case, you should invest in creating awareness at the
higher stages, around your customer outcomes and product use cases. In this
way, you’ll be able to educate your prospects about the fact that there is a
“new way of doing things”, and you’re building it for them. For example, Cello
could create content that showcases why user referrals through an API solution
are 10x better than doing it in-house.

By following this strategy and contextualizing your content to the market,
you’ll reach your target market at its current stage of awareness, speaking to
your prospects in their language, and saving countless resources on pushing
messages that are either too early or too late for the market.

Let’s continue with the Cello example. Because they operate in a fairly
competitive and mature market, I’d start creating content around the product
awareness stage, covering competitive products within the user referral
category to build a differentiating wedge with other players.

After completing one content program around this awareness stage (more on this
below), I’d move up or down the awareness stages depending on the results or
reactions around the content.

Now that we’ve identified which stage of awareness we want to start from, we
can move into content production strategy.

Each stage of awareness has [specific post
types](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jakezward_17-blog-title-templates-
ugcPost-7198290680736083969-UTaX/) — think of them as “template angles” that
generate awareness in that specific stage of your buyer’s journey, helping
spark reactions, and conversations, and ultimately “graduate” your prospects
to the next stage of awareness.

To make it easier for you, we’ve created a list of 25+ content types,
including examples.

**PS.** These post types work across formats:

  * Blog posts,

  * Landing pages,

  * LinkedIn posts

  * Short-form videos,

  * Audio, etc.

You should pick your format based on your understanding of your customer. For
example, if you think that your customer’s attention span is particularly low,
invest in video or landing pages; if they’re a technical user needing lots of
details, you might want to go for long-form.

Don’t forget to repurpose your content. You can easily[ create 50+ LinkedIn

**Note** : if you’re asking “What about keywords and SEO?”. Our view is that
content is the art, and SEO is the science — the former answers nuanced
questions, influences decisions, and builds brand credibility; the latter
appeals to search engines and social algorithms to rank or distribute your
content in front of your audience. With the rise of AI and the fine-tuning of
search algorithms, SEO has been shifting from a keyword-based to a [topic-
based approach](https://www.sanctuarymg.com/academy/seo/shifting-from-
keywords-to-topics/). And because of this, it’s important to invest in
[building topical authority](https://ahrefs.com/blog/topical-authority/) as
opposed to just blandly “target keywords”. By creating content around customer
outcomes following your buyer’s journey and their level of maturity, you’ll be
able to build topical authority because the algorithm will create content
series around a specific topic (eg. outcome, use case, product category,
etc.), boosting your authority around that topic.

Back to our content strategy.

Successful content requires consistency. A single post on each stage or topic
won’t get you far, as prospects need to repeat the same thing over and over
and across multiple angles and touchpoints. When approaching your first
content production, you need to think in terms of series or programs vs.
single pieces. This is what builds your credibility and influences prospects’
decisions.

What does this mean in practice?

###### 1\. Pick one outcome vertical in your stage of awareness map

Select the vertical that is[ the most painful, urgent, and widely
recognized](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pierre-herubel-540b3949_solving-
the-wrong-market-problem-sounds-like-activity-7155832059846922240-RcLN/) by
your prospects or customers. In the example of Cello above, let’s say I select
“I want to increase virality” because my customer interviews confirm this is
the biggest outcome my ICP wants to achieve.

###### 2\. Devise a series of X content pieces within that outcome vertical at
your selected awareness stage.

In the case of Cello — because the starting point is around product awareness
— you could start creating content 5-10 competitor-related landing pages
and/or buying guides covering the competitors with your highest traffic,
articulating how Cello is different and/or better for their specific ICP,
based on the above examples.

###### 3\. Building a tight syndication and distribution muscle

Share one core piece across multiple placements and/or turn it into multiple
[micro-pieces syndicated on social](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/7-step-
content-framework).

For example, let’s say Cello publishes 12 competitors buying guides on their
site; they could then share each of them on 12 newsletter editions, use them
as content for 12 webinars, or repurpose them to create 12 short-form LinkedIn
posts shared throughout the yearly content calendar.

The goal of this strategy is to focus resources on capturing demand around a
specific stage of awareness — which has the highest impact depending on your
audience's maturity — instead of bouncing across topics across different
awareness stages, which would dilute your resources. Once you’ve honed it,
move on to the next one.

By doing this, you will also build topical authority and brand credibility
around your customer outcomes; and position your company and how it can help
prospects achieve that outcome.

Once you have picked your first content program to capture your stage of
awareness, you can plan production and distribution across a content calendar.

Some rules of thumb Matteo recommends when using AI:

  * The closer to purchase you are in the awareness stage, the more the percentage of human writing is needed to capture technical nuances and details.

  * The newer your market is and the less existing content has been written about it, the more human writing you’ll need to bootstrap existing content.

Congrats, by now you should have:

✅ crafted your audience and product marketing messaging

✅ identified the best starting point to implement your content strategy

✅ devised your first content program

✅ and even used cutting-edge tools (AI-powered) to bring it to life.

Before you start publishing your content, please take this advice too.

**1️⃣ Get a “How did you hear about us?” question on your lead form**.

If your content gets you leads and demos from content, you’ll want to know
that right away. The easiest and arguably most accurate way of knowing it is
to get your prospects to self-select “social” or “content” from this form (see
[examples](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/free-trials-
fundamentals?utm_source=publication-search)). Because the last and ultimate
KPI of your content is to generate demand for your products, in the form of
leads/demos.

**2️⃣ Drive people to subscribe to your newsletter.**

We’ve had clients who’ve been posting on LinkedIn for months and generated
more than 1/3 of leads from content but ignored setting up a newsletter. Then,
when they needed to prepare for a big launch, they didn’t have a single list
to announce it to. Trust me, a newsletter is not something you want to treat
as an afterthought because you’ll miss all the people who are not ready for a
demo The second KPI of your content programs is to drive newsletter
subscribers. I recommend using [Loops](https://loops.so/) or
[customer.io](http://customer.io) as your newsletter and [lifecycle marketing
SaaS](https://playbooks.hypergrowthpartners.com/p/picking-your-lifecycle-
marketing).

**3️⃣Invest resources to post and engage on LinkedIn.**

You don’t just need to post, but also comment on your posts, and posts from
other relevant influencers or prospects. No one is going to know about your
content if you don’t share it where your audience is every day. The first
thing to measure the success of your content is monitoring your LinkedIn
followers and engagement rate.
