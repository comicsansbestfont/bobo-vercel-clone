Content marketing can be one of the most [powerful growth
channels](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/12-powerful-b2b-saas-
channels-for) for (early-stage) startups.

But don’t make the mistake to start with [content
](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-content-marketing-guide)for the
top of funnel (TOFU).

Instead, focus on Bottom-of-the-funnel (BOFU) content.

BOFU content target users with high(er) buying intent.

This normally means higher (sign-up) conversion rates, less keyword
competition, and lower costs.

Here are 3 content pages every B2B SaaS company should have.

**1️⃣ Comparison pages**

A page where you compare your product with (in) direct competition.

'Your company' vs. 'competitor1'.

Example: Lexoffice vs. Sevdesk.

You can also only write comparison pages where you review competitors only.

And add yours as the superior solution.

Example: Outreach vs. Salesloft vs. Lemlist (and why 'yours' is better).

**2️⃣ Alternative to pages**

A very similar approach to comparison pages.

Start with alternative pages for your closest and most famous competitor.

Example: Best/cheapest/GDPR compliant alternative to 'competitor'

**3️⃣ Usecase pages**

The idea is to write content for keywords around a specific outcome someone
wants to achieve.

Example:

How to write an invoice to non-EU customers? (e.g. for invoicing software)

or

How to schedule Linkedin posts.

-> Then you position your product as a solution to do so.

As you are targeting prospects who are aware of the problem and actively
looking for a solution, you can add more ‘aggressive’ CTAs (e.g. book a demo
or free trial) on these pages.

Message-Market Fit](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/hit-message-

Once you are moving from founder sales to founder-led sales, you need to start
having 1:1 meetings with your salespeople.

Running these 1:1 meetings without a clear agenda can be hard.

You will start to discuss random topics.

If the performance isn't good, they will try to skip the metrics part and
discuss other topics.

Especially if you do not follow a clear agenda.

You can copy my 1:1 sales meeting template
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oNIwNhEp86HGAU1Yn3OXjQiSCLxC_ZQPr3KS4jyXJfM/edit#).

**What’s important about 1:1 meetings**

✅ Run the meeting consistently (weekly or bi-weekly)

✅ 45minutes sessions

✅ regular fixed slots in your calendar

✅ shared 1:1 document (e.g. notion page or google doc.)

✅ prepare the meeting (written notes in the doc.)

**Here is a structure that worked quite well for me.**

1️⃣ 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝟮 𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗸𝘀? (𝟭𝟬 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝘂𝘁𝗲𝘀)

Go over the most important metrics.

Depending on your business and sales motion and specific role, this can be for
example:

  * New deals created

  * leads contacted

  * sales demos done

2️⃣ 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗸(𝘀) (𝟱 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝘂𝘁𝗲𝘀)

Sharing learnings fosters a learning culture.

A new learning can be industry-specific (insights about the market) or skill
related (e.g. new cold email template or objection handling hack).

3️⃣ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗱𝗶𝗱 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗮𝘀 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗱 (𝟱 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝘂𝘁𝗲𝘀)

It's also kind of a learning.

The intention here is to reflect on the past weeks.

It's about taking conclusions and how to make sure that you are not doing the
same mistake again.

4️⃣ 𝗣𝗶𝗽𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 (𝗗𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗗𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝟭-𝟮 𝗱𝗲𝗮𝗹𝘀) (𝟭𝟱 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝘂𝘁𝗲𝘀)

Go over the deal pipeline.

Pick 1-2 specific deals and work on them together.

What are bottlenecks, challenges, and questions?

Try to come up with concrete solutions.

5️⃣ 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗱𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘄𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝗻 (𝟱 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝘂𝘁𝗲𝘀)

Decide together on things where they can become better.

Provide solutions (e.g. training sessions, books, videos, etc.) to make it
actionable for them.

6️⃣ 𝗢𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿𝘀

Space for any other topic.

One of the main reasons why startups are not growing is misalignment between
the customer-facing teams.

What you will see is that **Customer Success 🥊 Sales 🥊 Marketing.**

Without alignment between the 3 departments, you will see a lot of finger-
pointing.

They will start to blame each other.

This normally sounds like this 👇

>  _We can't hit our sales quota because there are not enough SQLs delivered
> by Marketing._
>
> _We can't hit our onboarding goals/churn rates, because sales only close
> bad-fit customers._
>
> _We can't hit our CACs goal because Sales don't close enough of our SQLs._

𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿 𝗦𝘂𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀

> You don't provide enough guidance to the new closed deals. You need to
> onboard them better.

𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿 𝗦𝘂𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗼 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀

> You are closing any s***.
>
> They are super unhappy with the product.
>
> Have a ton of requirements we can't solve.
>
> They want to churn...

𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀

> You are not closing any deals. We provide so many SQLs, but you are bad at
> closing.

𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴

> All your inbound leads are bad quality and no SQLs.

Having aligned goals is a great way to achieve them.

Here are 5 actionable tips to create alignment:

✅ Shared sales and marketing goals

✅ Having strategy sessions with all departments (end-to-end analysis of the
funnel)

✅ Same understanding of the sales process (What sales stages do we have?)

✅ Shared terminology (e.g. What exactly is a SQL? What is our
[ICP](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-powerful-
ideal-customer))

✅ Meetings to analyze the funnel end-to-end (e.g. What are churn reasons? What
are main objections? What are the conversion rates?)

> Master multi-threading to go after larger customers successfully!

What's the secret to going upmarket and selling larger deals to bigger
customers?

In the absence of success stories from similar customers and a brand name,
targeting bigger companies can be challenging.

My best tip for breaking into these accounts is multi-threading. Here’s how: 👇

  * Step 1: Say you sell to Heads of People. Decision markers a BigCo’s are very busy and targeted by lots of vendors. Instead, find people in their org who aren’t that senior - Recruiters, Recruiting Coordinators, People Ops Associates etc.

  * Step 2: Reach out to them to learn about their challenges. They likely won’t get much outreach and will be much more responsive. Ask them about their day-to-day challenges, give them a demo, and ask for feedback. How much more productive could they be with your product?

  * Step 3: Use what you’ve learned to send an extremely personalised email to the Head of People: “Hi Jane, do you know that people on your team struggle with XXX?”. Share a snippet of what you learned, and ask Jane if she’s interested to learn more. Now, that’s an email that will for sure stand out in Jane’s inbox and merit attention!
