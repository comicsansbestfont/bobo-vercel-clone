This guide aims to give you a clear overview of the channels available so you
can start building a strong GTM strategy for 2025.

A GTM Channel is a way to get your messaging in front of your ideal customer.

Some channels are better fit for initial activities to fish first clients,
some are long-term GTM channels.

I like to think in hierarchies, so here is how I cluster the different GTM
Channels:

Direct channels are marketing and sales efforts directly interacting with your
target customer. These can be broken into:

Inbound channels attract and engage customers through valuable content and
organic interest.

Outbound focuses on channels where you proactively reach out to prospects to
generate demand

Indirect channels leverage external platforms and partnerships to drive
growth. It includes marketing/sales activities where third parties help you
reach and sell to your customers. They usually involve some kind of
‘partnership/relationship’ with third parties.

Let’s start with the channels where you are in direct touch with your
[ICP](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile).

Get your [message](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-
framework) in front of your [ICP](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-
ideal-customer-profile) on these inbound channels.

Be present on the different social platforms. For LinkedIn keep in mind that
personal profiles (e.g. founder profiles) perform better than company
profiles.

  * LinkedIn

  * Twitter

  * TikTik, Instagram, etc.

linkedin-posts-templates-to-get-started)

Create content on your channels. Focus on actually sharing value for your
ideal customers. This includes sub-channels like:

  * Your website (e.g. Blog & Resource page)

  * Run a YouTube channel, Podcast, and newsletter

  * Events & Webinars

  * Own Community

  * Free Tool (e.g. Calculator)

Guide](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-content-marketing-guide)

SEO and content marketing go hand in hand, ensuring that content is optimized
with relevant keywords and structured in a way that search engines and readers
both appreciate.

Two disciplines within SEO that have gained popularity are Product-led SEO and
[Programmatic SEO](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/144044986/bonus-material-
software-content-news).

Paid means you are paying money to another platform (Google, Meta, etc.) to
get your message in front of your ideal customers.

  * Paid Social

  * Paid Search

  *   * Out-of-Home advertising

Guide](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/146075220/how-to-get-started-with-
linkedin-ads-for-early-stage-bb-saas-startups)

Similar to paid channels, you use existing communities (where your ICP hangs
out) to get in touch with them.

It’s about openly sharing the journey of building your software, including
successes, failures, and insights, to engage an audience, build trust, and
create a community around the product before or during its launch.

Check out [Adam Robinson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/retentionadam/), [Simon
Høiberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonhoiberg/), [Guillaume
Moubeche](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaume-moubeche-a026541b2/) to know
what build-in-public means.

Building relationships with media, influencers, and bloggers to generate
awareness through earned media coverage, press releases, and thought
leadership.

Depending on your product and audience, talking about your product on stage
can be a great channel.

Be present at events where your ICP hangs out. Niche fairs and events can be a
great lead generation channel.

Your current customers refer your product to others. This happens organically
but can be incentivized with a proper [(2-sided) referral
program](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/43123035/referral-program).

It’s not a channel per se, it’s more a proper GTM motion ([PLG vs.
SLG](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-saas-growth)). PLG
leverages the product to drive user acquisition, retention, and expansion by
encouraging users to naturally share or invite others (through features like
referrals, user-generated content, or collaborative functionalities).

I like to divide Outbound into cold and warm outreach.

But both rely on the channels below to reach your target customers

So let’s explore the different outbound channels.

Everyone says cold calling is dead. I don’t think so. Give it a try.

Email still works. You need to send relevant and personalized messages. Not
generic mass emails.

👉 [TAPSA Cold Email Framework](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/137259555/the-
tapsa-cold-email-framework)

Same as Email. It works if you know who to target (your ICP), their problem,
and how your solution can help them. Relevance > Personalization > Quantity.

Of course, you can combine calls, emails, and Linkedin into multi-channel
campaigns.

👉 [LinkedIn Prospecting Sequence
Template](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/139777012/why-linkedin-sequences-are-
different-than-email-sequences)

Physical Emails have an awesome open rate.

By the way, Personalized letters and postcards are also a nice way to activate
and retain customers (e.g. Send every new customer a personalized welcome
letter).

This only works if you sell to customers with offline stores (e.g.
restaurants, retailers, hairdressers, sports venues…).

Warm outreach involves reaching out to prospects who have had some prior
interaction with your company or show existing interest.

It’s a way to prioritize your outreach efforts.

I see 3 types of warm outreach:

Intent-based prospecting focuses on identifying target customers who have
shown some level of buying intent through specific behaviors (trigger and
intent signals). These signals might include website visitors, social
activities, reviews, job changes, etc.

Some call this inbound-led outbound, others intent-based prospecting.

outreach](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/137259555/trigger-events-you-can-use-
for-your-cold-outreach-with-tapsa-framework)

Besides intent-based prospecting, 2 other outreach strategies fall under ‘warm
outreach’:

In network sales, you leverage your personal or professional networks (e.g.,
LinkedIn connections, industry events, associations) to identify and connect
with potential customers. It’s one of the best ways to find your first 10
customers.

In referral sales, you leverage existing customers, partners, or trusted
connections to introduce and recommend your SaaS product to potential new
prospects.

This often means reaching out to prospects through introductions made by
satisfied customers, partners, or colleagues who vouch for your product and
bring in trusted leads.

👉 [How to do Referral Sales](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/referral-sales)

Cold outreach refers to reaching out to prospects who had no previous
interaction with your company. The prospect may not be aware of your product
and hasn’t expressed any interest in your SaaS.

Now we covered the 16 direct channels to reach your customers. Now let’s
explore 5 more indirect channels.

Quick reminder: Indirect channels leverage external platforms and partnerships
to engage with your potential clients.

Marketplaces like Chrome Extensions, Salesforce AppExchange, Hubspot
Ecosystem, Shopify Appstore, Zendesk Marketplace, Zapier App Directory or Zoom
Marketplace.

Especially if you are building a tool ‘on top’ of an existing market leader,
marketplaces can be a very powerful channel for you.

Review sites like G2, Capterra, and OMR are great platforms for capturing
existing demand. Make sure to have a strong profile and be listed in the right
product category.

Under partnerships, you can find 3 main sub-categories. All leverage third
parties to promote your business.

  * **Strategic Partnerships**

Collaborating with complementary software providers.

  * **Integration marketing**

Co-marketing with your integration partners.

  * **Partner Programs**

Includes referral and reseller programs.

Incentivizing external promoters to drive traffic or sales.

👉 [Ultimate Affiliate Program
Guide](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/142577877/the-ultimate-guide-to-
affiliate-referrals-for-bb-saas-overview)

The goal is to use the influencer’s credibility and reach to promote your SaaS
product. Usually, it’s based on a fixed fee + commission model.

Now you know the 21 different GTM channels available to grow your SaaS from 0€
to 1€ million ARR and beyond. However, not all channels work equally for your
SaaS.

The right GTM channel(s) for your SaaS depends on view criteria.

—> Some channels are just more expensive than others. Your pricing needs to
justify the cost of the acquisitions.

—> Focus on direct channels first. The feedback and learnings you get
interacting with your clients are super valuable. Content, Outbound, and Paid
search gives you immediate feedback.

Also, some channels are very expensive (e.g. out of home) or take a long time
to establish (e.g. strategic partnerships), and because of that are not
available for most early-stage startups.

—> If your product is rather complex, buyers prefer more education and human
interaction (aka. sales-led). This comes with higher ACVs and impacts your
choice of the right GTM channels.

If your product is low in complexity, the opposite is true, which means SEO,
affiliates, marketplaces, etc. can work quite well.

—> If you are building a product in an established market, you can bet on
existing demand. This means people are actively looking for solutions, so
review platforms, paid search, and affiliates are channels with a good fit.

In comparison, if most of your buyers are not aware, you need to educate the
market. This means you need to bet on channels that enable you to do so (e.g.
outbound, owned content, events, etc.)

—> Some call it founder-model fit. Trust on (early) GTM channels that you can
master well.

That’s it for today. In an upcoming episode, I will dive into details on how
to choose the right GTM model based on ACV, market maturity, product
complexity, founder skills, and a few more.

**Happy growth 🚀**
