Most SaaS-founders close their first paying customers themselves, which is the
right way to go ([Check out: 8 Tips: How to get your first 10 paying
customers](https://alexstartuptips.substack.com/p/8-tips-how-to-get-your-
first-10-paid)). When you hit the first sign of product-market fit, you should
hire the first sales rep (in B2B SaaS).

In this blog article, I will share with you **7 bad signs of a failing sales
rep**. If you see such signs in your company, you should try to replace your
first sales rep asap.

A lot of (senior) sales reps, if they start working in an early-stage start-up
don't really understand the product. They do not take enough time to
understand the customer's perspective, challenges, nor to create a value-
selling strategy. Make sure your first sales rep spends enough time
understanding the product (& the
[customer](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile)).

This point is closely related to point 1. If your sales rep is not willing to
deep dive into the industry, gain know-how about the specifics, and want to
become an industry expert, that's a bad sign.

Word of mouth, warm intros, high touch relationships with customers, and
referral marketing are key growth strategies in the early stage. That's why it
is super important that your customer-facing employees (sales, customer
success, support & marketing) grow their industry-relevant network.

Only being able to sell with massive discounts is a sign of lacking sales
skills. Most sales reps use discounts because they have no other idea how to
close a deal or create urgency. Make sure your first sales rep knows about
value-based selling/solution selling, so they find other ways to convince the
customers.

The wrong sales reps spend too much time comparing with competition and blame
missing product features for unsuccessful sales performance. The best
salespeople know the competition well and can adapt their pitch to the
competition if needed. For good sales reps competition is just part of the
game and they want to beat them.

Wrong sales reps blame others and they miss accountability for hitting their
goals. Mostly they blame marketing, product, or support. Even if this is
usually true, it's a bad sign.

Early-stage sales is a really tough game. Mostly you try to convince customers
of an early (buggy) MVP. You need to be creative, and smart and always find
new ways. Great salespeople have a growth mindset.

  * Even if you are not a sales founder, try to sell your first 10–100 (depending on your customer & MRR) customers yourself. If you hire a sales rep straight from the beginning to do the first sales, you’ll never understand it yourself.

  * If possible hire two first sales reps at the same time. Why? You can compare both and better understand what works, and what doesn’t.
