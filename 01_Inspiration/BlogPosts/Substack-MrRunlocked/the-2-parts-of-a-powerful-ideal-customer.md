The biggest mistake you can make in your go-to-market strategy is _targeting
everyone_.

Instead, start to focus on a specific market segment, a niche.

It’s a group of customers that share common characteristics, needs, and wants.

It will allow you to:

  * Understand your customer's needs better

  * Tailor your [messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-framework) to resonate with them

  * Create a product that solves their specific pain points

Once you dominate that segment, you can expand into adjacent ones (Or stay
there forever).

**So what you need to do is to create your ideal customer profile (ICP).**

But an ideal customer profile is more than:

❌ company size

❌ job title

❌ geography

❌ hobbies

Instead, your ideal customer profile is a combination of exact information
about:

1️⃣ The company (firmographics)

2️⃣ The persons involved (decision maker & user)

With a powerful ICP, you have everything to create your [sales
messaging](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/hit-message-market-
fit-b2b-saas-startup) and hit message-market fit.

This means your message resonates with the prospect.

They know it’s for them.

Your sales messaging in a nutshell is to combine the:

🔸the exact problem they have (in their own words)

🔸 the (shitty) status quo (Situation A)

🔸 the desired dream state (Situation B)

🔸 their motivation to go from A to B

🔸 their costs/risk of not going from A to B

🔸 their motivation to go from A to B

Once you know your ICP, and you start doing outbound sales, you need to build
a list of your potential customers.

Linkedin is a great source to generate leads.

Using Linkedin Sales Navigator is a very common (and highly effective) method
to build lists of potential customers.

Here are 3 more unfamiliar ways.

**1️⃣ Steal followers from competitors**

Linkedin allows you to search for people that are following another creator.

**2️⃣ Event Participants**

Simply register for an upcoming event on Linkedin.

Once you are registered, you can see a list of all the other people who are
also joining.

Since they are interested in the topic, there’s a high chance that they belong
to your ICP.

You can easily export the leads using tools like
[Phantombuster](https://phantombuster.com?deal=alex40).

**3️⃣ Ex-employees of your clients**

Your existing customer base is a great source to drive your growth (especially
for generating referrals).

But ex-employees of your current customers are great prospects.

They already know your product and hopefully also like it.

If they move to another company, this can be a great door opener for you.

Linkedin Sales Navigator offers the lead filter _Past Company_.

Your _icebreaker_ is the part of your message, that is personalized for each
prospect. Mostly it’s the first sentence (email opener) of your message.

> 💡 The trigger event is basically a specific _Icebreaker_.

You know that I’m a big believer in the [TAPSA
framework](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/cold-email-template).

A powerful (cold) email always consists of the following 4 parts (simple
framework):

Today I share with you a list of information you can use for your Icebreaker:

**1️⃣ Job changes**

You can use the information that someone left the company, moved to a new
company, or took over a new role (e.g. promotion).

Especially in management positions that is a great time to reach out. Normally
they are very keen then to change things (which means it’s a good time for you
to help them solve their challenges).

**2️⃣ Funding event**

Especially if you target startups/scaleups this can be a very powerful trigger
event.

**3️⃣ PR & social media**

Recent posts or comments on Linkedin. Group members or event participants. New
Blog posts, newsletters, or another type of published content. All very useful
to write a powerful icebreaker.

**4️⃣ Industry news**

This can be a new law, research, upcoming event, or the latest trends. As long
as it’s relevant for them, you can make use of this.

**5️⃣ Website information**

Public information on their company’s website. Maybe changes in their pricing,
new features or products or job offers, etc.

> **Tip: Minimize product surface area at the start**

In Cello’s early days, our team was overflowing with ideas and excitement as
we joined forces with our first customers. We had tons of experience in
delivering complex products for big companies, but we knew Cello needed a
fresh approach.

To help prioritize, we embraced a key principle: **minimize product surface
area early o** n.

Here’s how we did it:

  1. When prioritizing features, **weigh the complexity they add for both your team and the customer.** Don’t just focus on the initial effort of building and releasing the feature; consider its long-term maintenance and support.

  2. **Limit the number of complex features with large surface areas**. Instead, concentrate on what makes an outstanding core experience for your end-users.

  3. Don’t sacrifice a **[delightful, end-to-end product experience](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp)** for a long list of features. Find inventive ways to solve user problems while keeping it simple and engaging.

At Cello, this meant we dedicated most of our efforts to creating an
effortless, in-product referral experience for easy customer integration. As
adoption soars, we’re now expanding into other exciting areas like enhanced
analytics and integrations.

> amplifies word-of-mouth by personally incentivizing users to share products
> they love with a monthly percentage of the referred subscription.
