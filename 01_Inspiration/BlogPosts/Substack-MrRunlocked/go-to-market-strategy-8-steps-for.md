After you’ve successfully [validated your business
idea](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-validate-your-idea-
before?s=w) and you’ve gathered enough conviction about your product, it’s
time to launch your B2B SaaS startup.

To maximize the chance of success, you should work on a powerful go-to-market
strategy that helps you to acquire and activate enough leads to kickstart your
[SaaS growth flywheel](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/5-steps-to-
master-your-saas-growth?s=w).

[Hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/gtm-strategy) defines a go-to-market
strategy (GTM) as “a step-by-step plan created to successfully launch a
product to market”. What it means is that your GTM strategy defines how you
literally connect your product with your potential customers.

Your go-to-market strategy covers the questions around...

  1. How do you communicate your value proposition to the market (brand messaging & [sales messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-framework))

  2. How do you sell the product to your [ICP](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile) and make them happy ([product-led vs. sales-led](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-saas-growth))

  3. What [growth channels](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-21-saas-gtm-channels) & growth activities work best for your product

  4. How do you make money ([pricing strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-pricing-strategy))

...and is one of the 3 core elements of your [SaaS Growth
Strategy](https://www.notion.so/The-SaaS-Growth-Strategy-Guide-incl-Worksheet-
ce97ab50eb90403ca3d6465853103367).

Today, I will share with you 14 important **topics you need to know about
successfully launching your B2B SaaS product** with a powerful go-to-market
strategy.

Actually, before you spend lots of time and money on building your product,
you should validate your business idea. Validating your idea can help you save
a lot of your resources in building something no one actually needs.

Check out those 2 articles on how to validate your business idea in a very
short amount of time:

Define up front what a successful MVP looks like (success metric) for you and
write it down. For instance, a successful MVP for your B2B SaaS could be
defined as follows:

  * a waitlist of #100 B2B customers (prosumer or SMB market)

  * 10% of waitlist sign-ups sold a special pre-launch Lifetime Deal

  * 20% of all interviewed companies signed a letter of intent

So when you validate your idea properly, you shouldn’t start with 0 customers.
You should have at least a couple of promising leads in your pipeline.

If you’re testing your business idea with a waiting list, think about adding
the following features to your process:

  * an incentive to refer other companies to you (e.g. refer 3 other companies and get a special Lifetime Deal)

  * creating a community of highly engaged sign-ups & potential brand ambassadors (Discord Channel, Slack Channel, Whatsapp Group)

  * following and sharing your company on Social Media

After you’ve validated your idea, you will make the decision if you continue
with the idea and invest time and money to actually build the product or start
testing another idea.

Once you’ve decided to build your product and launch it, a lot of startups now
spend months building the product without talking to customers and getting
early feedback. They think they need to build the perfect product in
undercover stealth mode and once the product seems to be ready, they push the
launch button and hope for success. As TK Kader describes it in his video
about [Go-To-Market Launch Plan For A New SaaS
Product](https://youtu.be/qum6AHYFKkw), lots of startup founders thinking
about launching their startup in a very _linear_ way (vs. a multi-threaded
way).

So launching is not just...

  * ... launching your product on Indiehackers, Product Hunt or Appsumo or...

  * ... that customers can now sign up on our website and test your product or...

  * ... that you've started to spend money on Google and Facebook ads

Of course, all of those things are part of launching, but launching your
startup should not just be one single launch event. So it's important to see
launching as a stage, rather than a single event.

So try to engage with your customers as early as possible, get their feedback
asap, and maximize the chance you are building something your ideal customers
really want. A great way is to build an engaged audience from the beginning
and continuously launch your latest product to them (more in #4).

One part of validating your business idea (#1) is to draft your first version
of [your ideal customer
profile](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-powerful-
ideal-customer?s=w) (ICP). The best way to do so is by doing customer
interviews, surveys, and job shadowing.

I'm referring to a great model by **[Myk Pono (Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):
How To Create A Comprehensive Customer
Profile)](https://www.mykpono.com/ideal-customer-profile-icp-how-to-create-a-
comprehensive-customer-profile/) t**hat says, that your ICP feels the pain,
has a fit to your product, and is ready to buy.

👉 **ICP = Pain + Fit + Readiness**

Define your ideal customer profile and the niche you are going after. The more
precise and clearer you are on your niche, the easier it gets for you to know
your customer needs and the BIG FIUU problem (frequent, important, urgent &
underserved) you are going to solve for them.

Ideally, the problem is frequent, important, urgent & underserved. This means
if you are going to solve their problem (with your solution), your product is
actually valuable for them, meaning they are willing to pay for it.

Validating your business idea, having ongoing launches, and knowing the pain
points and challenges of your audience lead you to build an (engaged) audience
from the beginning.

After you’ve analyzed the market and know the segment you want to serve with
your product, you can already start to engage with them. The good thing about
engaging with your audience from the beginning is, that your audience is
normally interested in the overall **problem you’re trying to solve.** This
means you can grow an engaged audience without having the final product.

You will learn about their challenges, problems, goals, wishes and at the same
time start growing your own audience, even if you don't have a product ready
to use.

Great ways to build an audience are mailing lists, Facebook groups, Slack
Channels, Content on Twitter or Linkedin, or running a Youtube channel or your
own blog.

Share relevant [content ](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-content-
marketing-guide)for your ideal customer persona, especially around the problem
you are trying to solve for them. Also when you are doing your [market
research](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-validate-your-
idea-before) and [customers
interviews](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-validate-your-
idea-before), don't forget to invite them to your mailing list.

Another way is to **build your product in public** , which means you are
sharing frequent updates on your journey. This could be sharing learnings from
your interviews (e.g. on Twitter, Linkedin...), first product mockups, product
demos, or public product roadmaps. The goal is to get early feedback (and
later convert those warm leads into paying customers).

I can highly recommend the article [Build in Public: The New Era of
Transparency in Startups by Growsurf](https://growsurf.com/blog/build-in-
public)

The brand messaging and your sales messaging are the 2 key pillars of your
company communication.

Your brand messaging is your unique view and
[positioning](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-positioning-6-different-ways)
of:

  * how do you see the market on a higher level (big picture)?

  * why do you want to serve the market (your motivation)?

  * why now? What are macro trends in our society supporting your business?

Talking about the purpose of the company (The WHY) and passion for the topic
of your business are effective pr strategies. A great starting point for
powerful brand messaging can be [the Golden Circle (WHY/HOW/WHAT) of Simon
Sinek.](https://simonsinek.com/commit/the-golden-circle)

So here is an example of how it could look like for the Creator Economy

  * Creator Economy is booming. More people than ever are following their passion and building micro-businesses. There are more than 50 million independent content creators, curators, and community builders and it’s one of the top dream jobs of the younger generation. We believe independent creators are the SMBs of the future.

  * With more creators becoming full-time creators (their main job), there is a growing demand for specialized tools helping creators to start, grow, engage and monetize their audience.

  * We want to support independent entrepreneurs to follow their dreams and turn their passion into a business.

The next step is to turn your value proposition into a powerful sales message.
Your sales messaging is the foundation for all your growth activities (landing
page, ads copy, emails, phone calls, sales demos, etc.).

A good way to work on it is to start with the big problem of your ICP and what
it means if they don’t solve it and then talk about the values of your product
and how you can solve it.

So when it comes to all customer-facing communication, it’s crucial to focus
on selling the values and benefits of your products and not on the features.
No one cares about how many features you have, what technology you are using,
or if you have a patent on it.

People care about how you can help them to solve their problems and what they
get from using your product (outcomes).

[Wes Bush](https://productled.com/blog/customer-acquisition-strategies) said:

> “When drafting your copy, always focus on the superpower your product will
> allow others to achieve in their own life. You want your customer to be the
> hero for choosing to use your product.”

Example:

_'In order for digital creators to monetize their audiences with paid products
(like courses, programs, or coachings), they need to connect and pay for lots
of different tools (Zoom, Paypal, Shopify, Calendly, Mailchimp, Teachable,
etc.). That's currently the only way for them to sell (premium) digital
products and turn their audience into a successful online business. We enable
digital creators to make more money online by just using one single tool.'_

Once your value proposition and the way you communicate your value to
customers are clear, you should think about your sales strategy ([product-led
vs. sales-led](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-
sales-led-saas-growth?s=w)), your [growth
channels](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/12-powerful-b2b-saas-
channels-for?s=w), and the customer onboarding journey.

Different segments in the market need different sales strategies.

Selling accounting software to a big corporate client needs a different
[positioning](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-positioning-6-different-ways)
and a different sales strategy than selling accounting software to early-stage
tech startups.

That’s why you need to position yourself in the market and also look at how
the competition is positioning itself. It helps you to find out how you can
differentiate against your competition.

Depending on your positioning, you need to decide on [product-led growth
(self-service) or sales-led growth](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/product-led-
vs-sales-led-saas-growth). Maybe also a hybrid model makes sense for you
(later stage) when you start to expand up-market (hunting bigger accounts) or
down-market (hunting smaller accounts).

You can try to segment the market and position yourself based on 2 main
dimensions (for B2B SaaS):

  * **Customer size** (Consumers, Prosumers, SMBs, Mid-market, Enterprise)

  * **Pricing** (low-cost vs. premium player)

Check out TK Kader’s Video ([Go To Market Plan - 6 Steps to Creating a Go-to-
Market Plan](https://youtu.be/n8GfATsQd2Y)) in which he also illustrates how
to position yourself in the market.

Getting specific on your [pricing
strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-pricing-strategy) is
also part of that. Most important is to know your value metric and define the
right pricing around it. Ideally your revenue scales with the value metric
(e.g. the more emails sent, the higher the pricing). Check out [10 tips on
your SaaS pricing.](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/10-hands-on-
tips-for-saas-pricing)

[Knowing who you want to serve](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-
customer-profile) (your ICP), how to speak to them (brand message, sales
message, value proposition) and how to sell them your product (sales
strategy), you can now start testing out different growth channels (have a
look at [16 B2B SaaS Growth
Channels](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/12-powerful-b2b-saas-
channels-for?s=w)).

There are lots of different growth channels and for every (early-stage)
startup it’s important to start experimenting with new growth channels and
hopefully find the ones that bring new customers. After testing, you should
spend your energy and resources only on the ones that impact traction for your
business (and stop the ones that don‘t).

Also, make sure to set yourself ambitious goals (can highly recommend using
OKRs as a framework) and align your team on specific growth activities they
need to deliver every week. Discuss those activities in your weekly (or
monthly) meetings.

Growth goals can be for example:

  * 3000 website traffic per week

  * 30 new sign-ups every week

  * 20% conversion to active user/ sales-demos

  * 1 new paying customer every week

Growth activities can be for example:

Once you’ve figured out how you can get new sign-ups for your product (for
product-led) or new leads in your pipeline (for sales-led), you should
(latest) start to work on a smooth activation.

Map out the touchpoints (customer journey) of your customers. For product-led
this mostly means working on a smooth onboarding process to get the customer
as fast as possible to the AHA moment (to reduce the time to value). For
sales-led it’s about getting new leads to jump on a sales demo with you and
having a great field sales meeting (if you target larger accounts).

Funnel)](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/5-steps-to-master-your-

Think early about how you can grow by leveraging your existing audience and
first users.

There are 2 main sources on how to get referrals - number 1 is asking your
customers for referrals (using a powerful referral program), number 2 is
making use of viral features in your product.

Not asking your existing customers for referrals is [one of the most common
mistakes in B2B SaaS
Growth](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/8-common-go-to-market-
mistakes-3x?s=w). So make sure you frequently ask your customers for referrals
and even incentivize them to do so.

What’s important about a referral marketing program:

  * customer segmentation: Track your customers’ NPS score and product usage and only target your happy customers

  * timing & frequency: ask your customers for referrals at the right time (not straight after the signup, give them some time to experience your product and become a happy customers). Think about triggers in your customer journey where customers are happy with your product and willing to refer your product.

  * referral incentive: What is the referral bonus (cash vs. free product usage vs. other perks) and who gets the bonus when? Make sure it’s transparent and use a two-sided referral program and incentivize both parties (the referrer and referred) - [check out some referral program examples](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/referral-program-incentives/) or [Cello referral program examples](https://cello.so/b2b-referral-program-examples/)

  * communication & messaging: Figure out the right messaging and best channels (in-product, email, phone...) to ask for referrals; create rules on when (triggers) and how often you ask for referrals

  * technical implementation & tools: referral tracking and referral bonus payout

To make use of viral features, Olof Mathé ([How to master product
virality](https://productled.com/blog/product-virality/)) gives you a great
overview of the different types of virality features:

  * Network effects —> The more users of the product, the higher the value of the product. Good examples are Social media platforms (Linkedin or Facebook) or Chat Apps (Whatsapp, Slack), or peer-to-peer payments (Paypal).
