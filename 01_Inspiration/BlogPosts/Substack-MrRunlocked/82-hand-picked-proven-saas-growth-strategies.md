A lot of time I see founders being obsessed with outperforming their direct
competitors.

Who do you think is your biggest competitor?

👉 Your most significant competitor is the status quo.

The no. 1. lost reason is that your prospects do nothing. They don’t take a
decision.

They don’t want to change. ❌

Naturally, people don’t like change.

And taking a decision on a new solution means change.

They want to keep things as they are and fear the unknown future.

Change is especially tough if:

Your job in sales and marketing is to get answers to ‘why now’ is the right
decision for them and why it makes sense for them (also in terms of ROI).

So, instead of focusing on being better than your direct competitors, you
should focus on being better than the status quo.

💡 Most of the time excel, word, manual processes, etc. are your biggest
competitors.

Show them how you can improve their lives and how you are the 'better' option
for them, compared to the status quo.

Here is how to do it:

  * do a proper discovery to find your prospect’s pain

  * get them to feel the pain and agree that they really have this problem

  * let them tell you, that their pain is really painful and that they need to solve it

  * show them how you and your product can solve it for them.

The [simple cold call hack in the last newsletter
episode](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/4-actionable-tips-to-grow-
your-saas-product) got really positive feedback. So here is another simple
piece of advice that changed my outbound success 10x 🚀.

✅ Always ask for referrals.

Reaching out to referral leads turns your cold outreach into ‘warm’ outreach.

It’s 10x easier to talk to a referred lead than to persuade a stranger.

Just imagine: If every prospect refers you to 2 others, you will quickly
accelerate your growth.

Here is how to do it:

  1. At the end of every call with a prospect, ask for intros.

  * If the prospect is interested, ask for others who can benefit as well.

  * If the prospect is not interested, ask for others who are a better fit.

  2. Ideally, ask them if they can actively introduce you

  * Get actively introduced via email (you are in CC)

  * Otherwise, reach out to the referred lead and let them know that XYZ told you they are a great fit.

So don’t limit yourself to asking for introductions at the end of ‘good’
conversations. Basically, always ask for intros. 😁

Try this strategy in your next 5 calls and let me know your results.

P.S. Also leverage the power of a 2-sided customer referral program.

The way companies buy software is changing.

❌ Old way: read my content, talk to sales and convince all stakeholders

✔️ New way: experience my product, get to aha-moment, and upgrade

Product-led growth (PLG) works best for:

✔️ rather cheaper products

✔️ rather simple products

✔️ rather quick time-to-value

But PLG is getting more and more the new standard, also if you target medium
and mid-sized companies.

Check out the excellent map by
[OpenView](https://openviewpartners.com/blog/the-product-led-growth-market-
map/) about companies leading the product-led growth game.

If you consider PLG for your product, check out how these companies do:

✔️ Pricing page

✔️ CTA on the website

✔️ Product onboarding

✔️ Messaging

✔️ How they deliver value as fast as possible (aha-moment)

Me, personally, I'm a big fan of how [Notion](http://notion.so),
[Canva,](http://partner.canva.com/alexnotion) and
[Webflow](https://webflow.grsm.io/notion) execute the PLG game.
