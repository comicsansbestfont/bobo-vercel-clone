In the last newsletter, we covered the [B2B SaaS Homepage Conversion
Blueprint](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/how-to-high-converting-saas-
homepage).

Today we cover the copywriting part of your homepage.

Before you work on your new SaaS homepage, and especially before you start
writing the copy, there are a few foundational things that you need to have.

Bits from customer feedback to find words they use to express the value they
see from using your product, problems they see with your product and
competitor products, and the exact words they use to talk about them.

You can find it through:

  * Customer surveys

  * Comparison site reviews (like G2 or Capterra), including your competitor reviews

  * Your customer service chat logs or emails

  * Customer interviews

Store them organized by project (e.g. product/feature/campaign) wherever you
like to store information to keep it handy, e.g.:

  * A shared Google doc or sheet

  * A Notion page

  * Any writing software that lets you organize and store text snippets, e.g. Airstory

Refer to it whenever you have copy to write – whether for an email campaign,
landing page, etc.

It should result from your [messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-
messaging) and positioning work you’ve done so far.

Use the [1-sentence value-proposition](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/simple-
value-proposition-canvas) canvas.

The Ultimate SaaS Messaging framework is your foundation for all your
customer-facing communication.

[Download your messaging framework](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-
ultimate-saas-messaging-framework)

It includes:

You will find the full SaaS Messaging Framework (Miro template)
[here](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-framework).

Your brand voice should result from your brand personality and define:

  * Your style (e.g., formal/informal, technical, conversational)

  * The English variant you use throughout your comms (American, British, Canadian, Australian, etc.)

  * Vocabulary (words to use and not to use when talking about your brand and product)

  * Grammar (e.g. using active voice vs. passive voice, sentence length, etc.)

  * Tone of voice to use across different channels

Now that you have worked on your foundations, you’re ready to work on your
homepage copy.

Just a quick reminder about the sections of your [SaaS
homepage](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/how-to-high-converting-saas-homepage).

The SaaS homepage copywriting guide will follow the structure of the SaaS
homepage template.

For each section, you will find formulas and real examples.

Let’s jump straight to the copywriting formulas.

With the templates and examples, we will focus on templates & examples that
work for early-stage SaaS companies. This means the focus lies on clarity!

Don’t compare your website with big brand websites. They have such a strong
brand and most visitors know about their product, so they can afford to be
‘unspecific’.

As an early-stage startup, you should focus on clarity.

**A good homepage should answer these 6 key questions for your visitors:**

  1. What is the product/service they offer?

  2. What problem does it solve for me?

  3. What can I do with the product?

  4. Who is it for? Is this product for me?

  5. What are the main benefits for me?

  6. Can I trust the company?

So focus your copywriting on clarity!

Let’s go section by section now.
