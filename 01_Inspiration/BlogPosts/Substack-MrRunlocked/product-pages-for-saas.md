When you’re just starting, your product is usually focused. It does one or two
jobs well.

And that’s exactly how it should be.

But as your product grows, so do its capabilities. It starts to solve more
problems and cover more use cases.

That’s when your homepage alone is not enough anymore, and it makes sense to
introduce product pages.

When it comes to [GTM assets](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-gtm-
foundation-part2), we talked a lot about the importance of your homepage.

Quick reminder, a good homepage should answer these 6 key questions for your
visitors:

  1. What is the product/service they offer?

  2. What problem does it solve for me?

  3. What can I do with the product?

  4. Who is it for? Is this product for me?

  5. What are the main benefits for me?

  6. Can I trust the company?

I recommend that your homepage come with the following sections:

  1. (Sticky) Navigation bar

  2. Hero Section

  3. Social Proof

  4. Before X (Problem / Status Quo)

  5. Intro Solution

  6. Capabilities Section

  7. Special Purpose Sections

  8. Main CTA

But your homepage is

❌ NOT a detailed page about how your product works.

❌ NOT a page purely on 1 specific use case or 1 specific feature.

Instead,

✅ That’s the job of product pages.

You usually find these pages sitting in the nav bar under ‘product’ or
‘solutions’.

As your SaaS grows, your homepage must serve visitors with diverse intents.

Someone might have heard about you in a podcast and might not have many
expectations.

✅ In this case, an overview of the product can be enough to keep the visitor
engaged and make them revisit another time.

✅ Other visitors might be looking for particular capabilities your product
delivers. Your homepage is unlikely to answer everyone’s questions fully.

That’s where product pages come in.

Product pages serve multiple purposes and help:

1️⃣ Homepage visitors find information that matches their specific needs
quickly

2️⃣ Sales and support teams share more information about a specific feature in
a snackable format

3️⃣ Search engines and LLMs understand the core capabilities of your product
and recommend your tool in their answers.

In terms of site structure, we see the following best practices:

  1. www.yourbrand.com/features

     1. www.yourbrand.com/features/feature1

     2. www.yourbrand.com/features/feature2

  2. www.yourbrand.com/usecases

     1. www.yourbrand.com/usecases/usecase1

     2. www.yourbrand.com/usecases/usecase1

  3. www.yourbrand.com/teams or www.yourbrand.com/industries or www.yourbrand.com/solutions/persona1

In SaaS, you see mainly 3 different types of pages that contain more detailed
product information.

1️⃣ Feature pages

2️⃣ Use-case pages

3️⃣ Customer segment pages (Persona/Teams, Company type, Industry pages)

Each of these pages has a slightly different focus.

✅ Feature pages and Use-case pages focus on ‘how it works’.

✅ Persona/Teams, company type, and industry pages focus on ‘Who it’s for and
how this type of audience benefits from using the product’.

As your SaaS grows, feature pages become essential for helping different types
of visitors, curious first-timers, detail-seekers, and decision-makers, find
what they need beyond the homepage.

No surprise, feature pages are around a specific feature of your product.

Not so surprisingly, there isn’t one perfect feature page template.

But at the same time, it doesn’t make sense to reinvent the wheel.

What matters is the story you tell to your audience. Getting your landing page
structure right is more important than the exact words.

When your structure is right, the story is easy for your visitors to follow.

Toni, the co-author of today’s episode and founder of LandingRabbit, a SaaS
landing page builder, has analysed hundreds of [feature
pages](https://landingrabbit.com/blog/saas-product-landing-page-examples) from
leading SaaS companies, and the most common structure looks like this:  

A high-performing SaaS feature page template includes:

  * Hero

  * Social proof

  * Benefits & Features

  * How it works (Sub-Features)

  * Case studies / Testimonials

  * Additional Resources (relevant use cases, templates, blog articles)

  * FAQ

  * CTA

Now, let’s take a look at the most common feature page elements through
examples.

##### Hero

On a SaaS website, the hero often determines whether visitors keep scrolling
or bounce.

A good hero section covers:

  1. Explanation of what the product is, who it’s for, and what it helps them do.

  2. A CTA button that invites action (usually a primary and secondary CTA)

  3. Visuals that back up the message without adding noise.

for this, it includes:

  1. Headline (H1)

  2. Subheadline or description

  3. Primary and secondary CTAs

  4. Visual element: Product image/animation/video

  5. Objection-handlers and Trust Elements

[Supahub’s feedback board feature page](https://supahub.com/features/feedback-
boards) gets it right.

##### Social proof

[Social proof](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-proof/) helps people
trust your product.

The simplest way to add social proof is to show logos just below the hero.

[Miro’s feature pages](https://miro.com/agile/) are a great example. The logos
are all black and consistently sized, keeping the section clean and making the
branding feel more intentional.

A great tactic that becomes more and more common is to add case studies to the
logo carousel. Clay was the first company to do this.

If you serve customers from SMEs to enterprises, choosing logos can be tricky.
Showing usage stats and review scores like
[Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/features/email-marketing/) is a great
alternative.

##### Benefits & Features

There is a lot of discussion on whether to talk more about features or only
benefits.

We strongly believe it’s always both.

❌Only talking about your features without explaining why it matters and what
results I can expect, only works for visitors who are already deep into
research mode (on which tool to use).

❌ Only talking about benefits and results is not enough information for
someone who really cares about how the product works.

✅ So, best, combine both.

Example: [Puck’s page](https://www.careerpuck.com/use-case/job-pages) on Job
descriptions does this well. The copy leads with the benefit, 'say hello to
your new teammates', and the image backs it up by showing how the product
delivers on that promise.  

On Surfe’s waterfall data enrichment feature page, they talk about the ‘tripe
checked’ but also about the benefit of it (lower bounce rate, fewer lost
deals…).

##### How it works (Sub-Features)

If you're in a crowded market, your visitors need to know more specifics about
your product.

They want to know the details:

  * “Do you also offer integrations to X?”

  * “How exactly does this feature work?”

  * “Do you offer localization for my CMS?”

That’s why many SaaS landing pages lean heavily on feature lists.

Take [Webflow’s SEO feature page](https://webflow.com/seo). It doesn’t just
talk about SEO tools. It gives the full picture, showing how SEO is connected
with the rest of the solution.

Or Beehiiv’s newsletter [editor feature
page](https://www.beehiiv.com/features/editor). The talk about the sub-
features of the editor feature.

But, feature walls are not the only way to add ‘how it works’ information.

You can also guide the visitors with a ‘how it works’ section.

Take the example of [Riverside’s Caption feature
page](https://riverside.com/?utm_campaign=campaign_5&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=rewardful&via=alexander-
estner).

##### Case studies / Testimonials

Case studies further down the page are another great way to create urgency and
build FOMO.

They also make it easier for your champion to bring others on board,
especially the decision-makers who won’t use your product but control the
budget.

[Remote’s HR software page](https://remote.com/global-hr/hris-software) does
this well. The section includes a real customer quote and links to a full case
study. Simple, credible, and easy to share.

##### Additional Resources (relevant use cases, templates, blog articles, or
more features)

Do you have more content that is specifically for this feature?

Then it might be a good idea to add them to your ‘additional resource’
section.

This could include:

✅ Templates for this feature

✅ Blog articles about this feature

Or simply guiding the user to other relevant features that your product
offers.

Let’s have a look at some examples.

[Lemlist](https://www.alexestner.com/tools) adds additional resources that fit
that specific feature.

They add LinkedIn templates and blog articles around that topic on the
‘LinkedIn prospecting’ feature page.

[Homerun’s job application tracking
page](https://www.homerun.co/product/applicant-tracking) and
[Asora](https://asora.com/features/data-aggregation/) are good examples of
highlighting other relevant features/products.

This makes it easy for visitors to explore what else they might need.

##### FAQ

Talk to a few customers in support chats and emails, and you’ll start to
notice the same questions repeatedly appearing.

A well-placed FAQ section at the end of your page is super useful.

✅ You can repeat things you already said above, and share more details.

✅ Pro-actively address common objections (e.g. Can I test the product for
free?)

✅ Easy to digest Q&A style info (great for LLMs to learn about your product)

Ramp’s page is a great example. Their FAQ covers key concerns clearly, right
where you’d expect to find them.

I’ve also added the most common questions about my[ 1-on-1 GTM
advisory](https://www.alexestner.com/services/gtm-advisory) in the FAQs.

##### CTA

The CTA at the end of your product page is super important.

This is where SaaS copywriting counts.

[Retool’s feature page](https://retool.com/use-case/dashboards-and-reporting)
does this well. Their core message is speed: you can build internal tools
fast. That’s why their final CTA line ends with 'in under 10 minutes'. It’s a
simple, specific promise.

Another great design tip is to:

✅ Create a different coloured box for your main CTA at the end

✅ Add a product visual again

[Introw](https://www.introw.io/) does this well.

While feature pages focus on describing how a specific feature works, use case
pages usually describe how users can use their product for different
‘purposes’.

Meaning you drill down the information to the relevant:

✅ Features (how these features enable running the use case)

✅ Target audiences (how they can perform the use case)

Here are some good tactics on how to run use case pages.

When your product can be used for multiple different use cases, launch a
pillar page with an overview of them.

A great example is Livestorm, a webinar software, can be used for different
use cases, including product demos, online conferences, company communication,
podcast interviews, and much more

> I like how Livestorm adds a dedicated section on their ‘live event’ use case
> page that drills down on how you can use their product to host online
> events.

And again, they customize their social proof to that specific use case.

These ‘target audience’ specific pages usually contain specific information on
how this target audience is using the product.

Meaning you filter the relevant:

✅ Features

✅ Use cases

for this audience. So they feel this product is specifically made for them.

Depending on your market and type of SaaS (vertical vs. horizontal SaaS)
you’re building, it might make sense to build specific pages for:

✅ different Teams (Yourproduct for marketing, Yourproduct for sales…)

✅ different Personas (Yourproduct for designers, Yourproduct for SDRs…)

✅ different Company Types (Yourproduct for Hairdressers, Yourproduct for
Massage Salons…)

✅ different Industry (Yourproduct for Healthcare, Yourproduct for Tech
Companies…)

Here are some good tactics on how to do this.

Example: livestorm.co/industries/saas

Example: tldv.io/teams/sales/sales-managers/

On your Persona, Company type / Industry pages, you add a section where you
highlight the relevant use cases for this target audience.

Call out the features that the target customers care about.

Instead of adding any social proof, add the case studies/testimonials from
that specific target customer type.

Okay…that’s it for today.

Now you know how to add strong product pages to your SaaS.

Happy growth 🚀
