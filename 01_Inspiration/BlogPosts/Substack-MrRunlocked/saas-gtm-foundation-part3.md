Quick reminder 👇

**GTM foundation = GTM Experimentation + GTM Playbook V1**

It brings you to Product-Market Fit.

This means you’ve found **problem-solution fit** and **GTM-fit**. So you’re
ready to scale.

When I talk about building a strong GTM foundation, I refer to these 10
elements:

  1. Ideal Customer Profile (covered in **[part 1](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-gtm-foundation))**

  2. Positioning (covered in **[part 1](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-gtm-foundation))**

  3. Messaging (covered in **[part 1](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-gtm-foundation))**

  4. GTM Collaterals (covered in **[part 2](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-gtm-foundation-part2))**

  5. Channels (covered in **[part 2](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-gtm-foundation-part2))**

  6. Pricing (covered in this episode)

  7. Sales Motion (covered in this episode)

  8. CRM & Tracking (covered in this episode)

  9. Forecasting & Planning (covered in this episode)

  10. Internal Operating Systems (covered in this episode)

Feel free to use the **GTM checklist** to start working on your GTM 👇

When it comes to pricing, there is more to answer than the actual price tag
€€€.

So when I work with founders, we work on different pricing elements.

✅ pricing model & value metric

✅ packaging & price tiers

✅ Terms (Payment, Cancellation, Trials…)

✅ Discount policy

But the most important part is to see pricing as something iterative.

I like to think about pricing as something iterative.

You have a pricing strategy to get from:

1️⃣ 0 to first 10 customers = pricing v1

2️⃣ 10-100 customers = pricing v2

3️⃣ 100 to X = pricing v3

Your pricing needs to match the stage of your company.

> ⛔ So don't copy the 'perfect' pricing models from Notion, Miro, and Asanas
> of the world.

Not if you are early-stage.

Pricing for early-stage startups is NOT about optimizing growth.

I believe pricing should be good enough to NOT stop you from growing to 1€
million ARR.

Instead, take it iteratively. Have a quarterly pricing meeting.

And work on:

✅ Aligning pricing model with growth motion (sales-led vs. product-led)

✅ Finding the right value metric (for value-based pricing)

✅ Getting clarity on packaging

So you need to analyze:

\- Packaging & Value Metrics

\- POC, Free Trials or Freemium

\- Pricing terms (contract length, payment schedule, cancellation policy)

This is something that a customer or prospect associates value with. It is
basically what you charge for eg, per seat/revenue/storage, etc.

Your value metric should

👉 More on [value metrics in our pricing
guide](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/134485840/step-choose-your-value-metric).

And building an AI-app/ai-powered SaaS, Kyle shared an [interesting overview
of latest AI pricing models](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kyle-poyar_ai-
pricing-saas-
activity-7257366623399948288-a6xz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACDXQD0B60CCv1N4uaFeQHA-
QG_9AzK_eyg).

You need to decide on what is (not) included in each pricing tier.

In case you want to package your plans around specific features (feature-
gating), this is the time to do so.

P.S. I’m not the biggest fan of feature gating when you’re early. You don’t
have enough data to know which feature belongs best to which plan. Keep things
simple.

You need to decide how potential customers can evaluate your product. There
are different options; decide on what fits your stage/model.

Here, you decide on pricing policies like

Getting customers to annual plans is good for your cash flow. Besides giving a
10-20% discount on annual, you can add more on top.

It’s okay to give discounts, but create a framework of when, how, and why to
give discounts.

Also, make sure you get something in return for your discount:

✅ [Testimonials](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/guide-case-studies), referrals,
co-creating content, upfront payment, longer contract, and being a pilot
customer

💡If you want to learn more about how to get it right and what to keep in mind
when figuring out your pricing strategy, check our [Ultimate Pricing
Guide](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-b2b-saas-pricing-guide)

You need to decide on a dominant sales motion.

❌ Don’t try to run both motions in parallel. Stick to one.

Each motion works differently. Different skills and resources are needed.

Deciding between PLG vs SLG depends on factors like

  * How your customers actually want to buy your product (not what you personally prefer)

  * The complexity of your product // how easy can you deliver the value

  * The complexity and length of the buying process

  * The price point of your product

💡Read more about selecting the right motion for your SaaS
[here](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-saas-growth).

Start to draw your customer journey (e.g use [Miro](https://miro.com/)) -
don’t forget the customer success/onboarding part.

Decide intentionally how you get them from one stage to the next stage (e.g.
email sequence, calls, in-product tour…).

For PLG, define key actions:

  * Website traffic

  * Sign-Ups

  * Activation

  * Paid

  * Upgrade

For Sales-led, go with:

  * Lead

  * MQL

  * SQL / Opportunity

  * Closed Won

  * Active

**Clarify Stage Exit Criteria** : For each stage in your funnel, define what
qualifies a prospect to move to the next stage.

Example:

Why: Without clear exit criteria, teams get misaligned, and your funnel data
gets messy.

This is, of course, different from company to company. But make sure you have
your own definition of each of the stages.

Once in place, it gets easier to identify bottlenecks and things that need
improvement.

Sales qualification methodologies help you better qualify leads and make a
good discovery.

Here are 4 methods I recommend:

You can learn more about each [here](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/sales-
qualification-discovery-calls).

In case you follow a sales-led motion, discovery and demo calls are the key
elements of your sales process.

> But should you split discovery and demo into two calls or just a ‘disco-
> demo’?

You can either do -

  * Both in a single call (disco-demo) or

  * Two separate calls, one for discovery (15 - 30 mins) and another longer one (45 - 60 mins) for demo.

There is no ‘ideal’ way - every B2B SaaS has a different sales process.

But generally speaking, I would split discovery and demo into 2 separate calls
if:

✅ Deal Size: over €10k ARR

✅ Product Complexity: rather higher (more integrations, configurations, custom
solutions…)

✅ Sales Cycle: usually longer than 3 months

✅ Buyer expectations: expect tailored demos

Apart from asking questions, you should also aim to add value to your
prospects in the discovery call.

At the end of this call, both parties need to mutually agree that it makes
sense to move on.

**Here are 24 sample questions for your discovery call:**

discovery](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/sales-qualification-discovery-calls)

[Get Product Demo Guide](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/107424163/a-step-by-
step-guide-to-the-phases-of-a-successful-saas-product-demo)

You should have a template for each stage of your sales process, from initial
contact to discovery to disco-demo and demo.

🚨Send these emails ASAP after the meetings, ideally not later than 24 hours.

Find the exact [sales email
templates](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-4-must-have-sales-email-
templates) you can copy and paste.

On top, it’s very helpful to have video assets (from your product) that you
can share with prospects.

templates)

We won’t cover the whole CRM Set-up. But I will highlight a few things that
really make a big difference.

P.S. Unsure about the right CRM for you - here’s a list of [my vetted SaaS
tools](https://alexestner.notion.site/Vetted-SaaS-
Tools-3329096569f741a2822b98e9708b39c4).

1️⃣ **Lost reasons**

Learning why you’re losing the deal is pure gold. Track these in your CRM to
understand why you’re losing customers.

2️⃣ **Self-reported attribution**

It means that your customers tell you how they found you/your product. By
doing so you will learn what channels work to optimize your campaigns

For PLG:

For Sales-led:

  * Add it on your ‘book a demo’ form (use an open text field → best to get insights)

  * and then add on top a dropdown field in your CRM where you map the text field responses to a list of options (easier for reporting)

> 3️⃣ **(Mandatory) properties**

Your CRM is the best place to learn about your ICP. Here are a few fields I
usually recommend founders make mandatory along the sales process.

**Contacts** :

**Companies:**

**Deals:**

Additionally, it makes sense to track:

Setting up the right deal stages in your CRM is crucial for tracking both
sales progress and post-sale customer success.

Don’t stop at ‘Closed Won’ — the journey doesn’t end when a deal is signed.
It's just the start of delivering real value.

After 'Closed Won', your CRM should transition the customer into an onboarding
and success pipeline, with clearly defined stages such as "Kickoff Scheduled,"
"Onboarding in Progress, "Adoption Phase".

Define the key metrics you monitor and review daily, weekly, monthly, and
quarterly.

To give you some inspiration, here are metrics that might be relevant for you
as well.

**Website & Lead Generation Metrics**

✅ Website Traffic (Sessions)

✅ # New Leads

✅ # New MQLs

**Sales Pipeline Metrics**

✅ # New SQLs / Opportunities

✅ Pipeline Generated €

✅ Weighted Pipeline €

**Sales Activity Metrics**

✅ # Discovery Calls Done

✅ # Demo Calls Done

✅ # Proposals Sent

**Sales Output Metrics**

✅ # Closed Wons

✅ # Closed Lost

✅ Closed Won €

✅ Closed Lost €

✅ Expanded Revenue €

✅ Churned Revenue €

**Sales Efficiency & Conversion Metrics**

✅ MQL to SQL Conversion Rate

✅ SQL to Opportunity Conversion Rate

✅ SQL to Closed Won Conversion Rate (Deal Win Rate)

✅ Sales Cycle (Rolling 90 days)

✅ Average ACV €

Your financial plan is not meant to be for your day-to-day operations.

So, reverse engineering is breaking a hard-to-grasp goal into very specific,
short-term goals. Something you can work on within your daily operation.

[Get free sales plan template](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/reverse-
engineering-template-saas)

Use these steps -

Step 1: Set your ‘top-down’ goals (e.g., from the financial plan)

Step 2: Define ‘assumptions’ - ACV, conversion rates, and sales cycle.

Step 3: Calculate backward to know every step of your funnel (website
impressions, leads contacted, demos, customers)

On top, you can also do a bottom-up planning (to check how realistic it is).

##### When to hire

When it comes to hiring the first GTM hire, there is one timing that usually
never works out and can therefore be considered wrong: before you reach
[message market fit](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/hit-message-market-
fit-b2b-saas-startup).

**Before you hire, you, as a founder, need to validate**

✅ That there is a problem to be solved,

✅ What that problem specifically is and what it means to potential prospects,

✅ How your solution looks like / what it needs to be valuable

✅ What messaging and channels work to win early customers

##### Who to hire

This highly depends on what stage you are at, but our recommendations are

✅ Startup phase - Full Cycle salesperson

✅ Growth phase - Specialized roles. SDRs, AEs, CSMs

✅ Mature Phase - Further specialization. Divide roles by market segment,
geography, function etc.

And when it’s about the first GTM hire (after the founder), we recommend
hiring a ‘[sales pioneer](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/161309912/mistake-
hiring-the-wrong-first-salesperson-pioneer-ae)’.

💡More here on [who to hire](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/first-gtm-
hire?open=false#%C2%A7what-skills-do-they-need-to-have) and [common
mistakes](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/hiring-9-mistakes).

[Don't make these hiring
mistakes](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/hiring-9-mistakes)

Building your GTM foundation is also about internal processes, meetings, and
ways to work together. I recommend that you take your time and create your
systems to deal with:

✅ Investor Updates

✅ Founder Syncs (weekly meetings, offsites…)

✅ Goal-setting frameworks (e.g. OKRs)

✅ Sales, Marketing, Customer Success Syncs

✅ Product & ‘GTM’ Syncs (Roadmap planning, Customer Feedback…)

✅ Competitive Intelligence (Battlecards, Product Updates…)
