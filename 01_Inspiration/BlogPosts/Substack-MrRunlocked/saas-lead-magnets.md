Leads aren’t just emails! With everyone prioritizing content, the purpose of
lead magnets is now not only to “get emails” but also to get attention from
the right people (your ICP).

Lead magnets can take a lot of forms: gated or ungated, webinars, e-books,
reports, etc., but the core definition remains the same - a content asset to
attract the attention of your ICP (after all, it is called a lead “magnet”).

Buyers are drowning in generic LinkedIn posts and blog spam. Lead magnets cut
through the noise, but only if they

  * are hyper-relevant

  * offer genuine value

  * solve a problem

In 2025’s ‘fast fashion SaaS’ era, this might be the only way to get real
attention.

**1️⃣ Great foundation to repurpose content from**

Lead magnets present an ideal raw material for repurposing original ideas into
various content formats and topics.

E.g. - Out of one original research or a bigger guide, you can get

P.S. Remember when I shared a framework on how to [turn 1 content ideas into
50+ content pieces.](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/138951781/how-to-turn-
content-idea-into-content-pieces)

**2️⃣ You get Leads/MQLs (emails) + Option to nurture/follow up**

The primary advantage of lead magnets is that you can identify individuals
with an interest relevant to your product.

You get their email address.

So you know who they are and can nurture them or warm outreach to them.

Lead magnets are usually the second step in your content funnel.

Either you

  * Run ads, and then the second step is to get them to a report (lead magnet).

  * Have SEO written content, and the CTA is to download the lead magnet

  * Write LinkedIn posts, use the “COMMENT” method, and move people from the LinkedIn post to the lead magnet.

**3️⃣ You get more attention**

Given that these are usually downloadable assets, they lend themselves to a
reading experience beyond scrolling.

If a prospect has downloaded an asset, that’s a signal that you’ve grabbed
their attention.

Plus, surprisingly (or maybe not so surprisingly), content that is ‘gated’
gets a higher value attributed.

People think that’s really valuable. _I want that._

**4️⃣ You can build trust through Thought Leadership content**

Original insights from your product, customer surveys, or your own experience
as a founder are perfect material for a lead magnet. great way to build trust
with your ICP and give them the confidence that you are an expert in your
niche.

Creating lead magnets (valuable content for your ideal customer profile) puts
you in a good position - they recognize you as a thought leader.

And we all know, at the end, people buy from people they trust.

**5️⃣ Relevancy (from your buyer’s perspective)**

This one sounds obvious. But, like other forms of content, lead magnets are
most useful when the topic/content itself is relevant for your buyers.

Given that you will be addressing the most relevant pain points of your ICP
through lead magnets, from your buyer’s perspective, they are a great source
of information about topics in your niche.

By now, you know why lead magnets work. Now let’s talk about the different
types of lead magnets.

There is not just one type of lead magnet.

We believe you can cluster them into 3 hierarchies:

**1️⃣ Tactical: Templates, examples, checklists, calculators**

These are pure gold because they solve immediate problems of your ICP.

Your prospect downloads it, plugs in their data, and starts seeing results.

Why do these work so well? Plug-and-play value.

**2️⃣ Educational: Guides, ebooks, courses, webinars**

These require time investment but deliver deeper insights. They work when
you’re solving a specific, urgent problem your ICP faces right now.

The key? Focus on “how-to” rather than “what is.” Your prospects want step-by-
step processes, not theory.

Best formats: Step-by-step guides, detailed case studies with metrics, and
recorded webinars with actionable frameworks.

**3️⃣ Inspirational: Industry reports**

Lowest conversion potential, but highest shareability.

Prospects download these to stay informed, not to solve immediate problems.
They skim them, maybe share them, but probably don’t come away with actionable
takeaways to implement.

Now that we have an idea about the value hierarchy, let’s look at examples of
some of the best lead magnets within each category.

A lead magnet can take many different forms—many different types of useful
content can help you reach potential buyers... But there are a few established
formats marketers tend to rely on.

Events & Webinars

This includes your own research, but you can of course also bring together
multiple industry leaders, who can be internal and external to your company.

Now that you know different types of lead magnets, let’s understand what makes
up a really good lead magnet.

**✅ Specific and relevant content (for ICP)**

The content of the lead magnet needs to be relevant and specific for the
target audience. Think about the problems they are facing, their KPIs, and the
information they need to make decisions.

Creating content that helps them in their daily workflows is the best way to
get them hooked.

**✅ Subtly selling the product**

The best lead magnets, even if they are top to middle funnel, sell at least
the need for the product. Even if they don’t directly mention the product,
they speak to problems the ICP has that the product can solve.

We recommend always educating on the problem and plugging your product as
(one) solution to fix it.

In most cases, you can subtly sell your product:

  * Add product visuals (if possible)

  * Add your branding to the asset

  * Add a footer with your 1-sentence value proposition / CTA

**✅ The right distribution**

Is your lead magnet where your ICP is actually looking?

Good, successful lead magnets are promoted to your ICP on the customer-facing
channels they prefer

So make sure you invest in distributing the lead magnet, not just producing it
- or no one will see the results of your hard work.

You know what good formats are and how to make good lead magnets, now let’s
see how you can actually start making them, step-by-step

You can’t create valuable content for “everyone.”

Before starting with anything, work on your[ Ideal Customer
profile](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile)

Different goals need different approaches: Do you want to:

  1. **Create awareness** : Use inspirational content that introduces your category

  2. **Make them consider:** Use educational content (e-books, guides, templates)

  3. **Help them decide** : Use ROI calculators, case studies, and implementation templates

Stop guessing. Start listening. Get inspiration from -

  1. Sales call recordings (what questions come up every time?)

  2. Support tickets (what confuses new users?)

  3. Lost deal reviews (why did they choose competitors?)

  4. Customer interviews (what almost stopped them from buying?)

Different topics fit naturally with different content types.

So think about what type of format is the best fit for your topic.

Is it video content? Is it a notion page? A webinar?

Here’s where most founders fail. They try to create the ‘ultimate’ resource on
their first attempt.

A better approach is to start small.

Instead of

❌ ”The Ultimate Cold Email Guide”

start with

✅ “3 email templates for better cold emails”

Start with a simple one-pager. Test it. See if people actually want it. Build
on that as you go.

Don’t wait for perfect.

You need data (impressions, downloads, likes, feedback, etc.), which you’ll
get only if people see what you’ve built. Understand where your ICP lives, and
find ways to make the lead magnet accessible to them (we have an entire
section on distribution later in this episode).

So distribution is key.

We recommend:

✅ Start early on with distribution / sharing your lead magnet

✅ Spend as much time on distribution as on creating the content

Here’s the question that matters: “Was this immediately useful?”

Don’t be afraid to ask for feedback.

Most founders ignore feedback and keep promoting mediocre content.

Common feedback patterns that you might get -

  * “Too generic” → Add specific examples and numbers

  * “Too long” → Create a summary version

  * “Missing X” → Add the missing piece as an update

Once you have a winning lead magnet, make the most out of it.

E.g. - Turn your:

  * Guide into a webinar series

  * Template into a video walkthrough

  * Case study into LinkedIn content series

One good lead magnet can easily fill a month’s worth of content (minimum).

We’ve talked about the importance of distribution. So let’s have a look at 7
actionable tactics that you can implement right away to get more eyeballs on
your next lead magnet.

Most outreach sucks because it’s all about you.

Flip it.

_Instead of pitching, send your resource first._

If they care, they will respond. And then you can still ‘pitch’.

**The framework:** “Saw your recent post about [specific challenge]. We just
created a [resource type] that helped [similar company] solve exactly this.
Worth a look?”

Or here’s a DM I’ve tested a few months ago 👇

I’ve shared a full guide on social selling tactics, [including value-first
LinkedIn DMs](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/148840640/run-value-first-
linkedin-dm-campaigns).

We recommend that your website has 2 CTAs, one primary CTA (e.g., Book a demo)
and one secondary CTA (e.g., Read success stories).

Or you can also add a banner on top of your website to promote your new lead
magnet.

Post valuable insights, then offer the full resource to engaged commenters.
You must have seen this at least once (I’m sure more).

**The formula:**

  1. Share a screenshare/visual/snippet of your lead magnet in your post

  2. End with: “Want the XY for free? Comment ‘XX’ below and I will send it your way”

  3. DM the resource to everyone who comments

  4. Follow up with additional value, not sales pitches

Some examples:

Every blog post should have a relevant lead magnet offer and find ways to
internally link lead magnets across blogs..

Pro tip: Match the lead magnet to the blog topic. Don’t offer a “Complete GTM
Guide” on a post about email deliverability.

Target micro-influencers in your niche. Think about newsletter writers,
LinkedIn creators, podcast hosts, etc.

Turn your lead magnet into live content. Host a webinar walking through the
key insights, then offer the full resource as a follow-up.

If your lead magnet performs well, you can turn it into social ads - e.g.,
running LinkedIn Ads or Instagram Ads where you promote the content.

Lead magnets still work if they’re specific, valuable, and distributed
smartly. Start small, test, and double down on what resonates.
