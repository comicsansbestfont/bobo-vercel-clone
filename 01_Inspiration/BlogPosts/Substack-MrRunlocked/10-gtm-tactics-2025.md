This week’s edition is a little different.

Most of the time, I share deep-dive guides - tactical frameworks, strategic
plays, and tested SaaS GTM principles.

But now we’re entering the second half of the year.

And if you're like most early-stage founders, you’ve just wrapped up your H1
review - taking a hard look at what’s working, what’s not, and what needs to
change to hit your goals by the end of the year.

This issue is here to help with that.

I’ve curated 10 tactical, actionable GTM plays you can implement this week.

They help you generate new leads (build a qualified pipeline) and close more
of your existing pipeline.

Creating good case studies is one thing.

Together with Romana I wrote a [full guide on case
studies](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/guide-case-studies).

Making use of them is the other thing. Most companies embed their s[ocial
proof on their website](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/146545088/the-social-
proof-section).

But what they ignore is using case studies strategically in their sales
process and/or thinking about other ways to share their case studies online.

So, doing a ‘customer success story campaign’ can help you close your pipeline
faster.

**Here are a few ways:**

✅ Drop them into [your cold
outbound](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/139777012/the-steps-of-a-powerful-
linkedin-prospecting-sequence-tppssb-framework) \- pair a quick value prop
with a customer result (“we helped X cut Y by Z%”)

✅ Add your case studies to your newsletter (product updates)

✅ Add case studies in your [sales email
templates](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/148809434/follow-up-emails) (matched
by persona or industry)

✅ Re-activation campaign with lost deals / old leads

✅Use them as call-to-action in (retargeting) ads (e.g. “See how [Company]
solved X with [Product]”

✅ Post short success clips on LinkedIn (part of your[ founder-led
LinkedIn](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/founder-led-linkedin-guide) activity)

This aligns perfectly with 1️⃣.

I saw it first done by Clay - now more comanies adapt this. I think it’s
brilliant as you add another (social proof) CTA in your hero section without
cannibalizing the other content.

is adding case studies in their social proof section

The idea is to leverage your partner's network and credibility to reach their
audience.

Build a dedicated integration page and co-create content like webinars or blog
posts to tap your partner audiences.

Use every touch point with your customers to find who else from their network
can benefit from your solution.

Depending on your sales motion and stage of the company, this could look a bit
different.

✅ [Asking for referrals](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/159337165/bonus-
section-referral-playbooks-using-linkedin) in your sales and customer success
calls

✅ Building a [user-led referral
program](https://cello.so/invitation/?productId=cello.so&ucc=TUetwM90eUF&celloN=QWxleGFuZGVy)

Other than the customer referral program, you now incentivize third parties
(non-customers) to refer your product to their network. Usually, you offer
commissions or revenue share for successful referrals.

In my [affiliate referral guide](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/your-ultimate-
guide-to-affiliate-referrals), we talked about the different types of
‘partners’ you can win for your referral program.

✅ Influencer / Creators

✅ Value added partners (e.g. consultants, service providers)

Publish a gallery of ready-to-use templates with previews and "Use Template"
CTAs.

This one works especially well if your product solves very specific use cases
that people search online.

“How to do X” or “How to connect X and Y” “Template for X”

Have a look at companies like [lemlist](https://get.lemlist.com/0rxvigavj545),
[airtable](https://www.airtable.com/templates) or
[miro](https://miro.com/de/templates/) who are doing a great job here.

> Display an in-product banner promoting annual plan savings for existing
> customers (on monthly payments).

Miro does it and incentivizes users to upgrade from monthly to yearly plans.

The idea is to build a content hub (pillar page) that contains all your
[competitor-related content
pages](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/147302979/content-types-examples):

✅ “X vs Y” comparisons

✅ Competitor alternatives, and

✅ Best-of “product category” lists.

Have a look at these great examples:

The idea is to monitor highly-relevant keywords on social and respond to them
(with comments & maybe even relevant outreach).

👉 Want to deep dive? Together with Charlotte, I wrote a [social listening
guide](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/social-listening-guide) for SaaS
founders.

The idea is to track first-party intent data and then do a warm outreach.

Especially website visitors and LinkedIn engagers are highly relevant.

Together with Florian, I wrote a full guide on [4 Allbound
playbooks](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/160494234/highly-relevant-allbound-
playbooks-step-by-step) you can copy for your business.

That’s it.
