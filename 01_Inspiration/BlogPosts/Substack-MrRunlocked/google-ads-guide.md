Every SaaS startup will think about adding a paid channel to their go-to-
market strategy sooner or later.

However, launching Google Ads for an early-stage B2B startup is a big deal.

It requires taking a leap of faith and investing money in a channel that might
seem like a black box. At the same time, it’s one of the best ways to
accelerate customer acquisition, build brand awareness, and give you an edge
over competitors.

But here’s the thing: you need to know how (and when) to do it right.

In this guide, we’ll discuss the most critical aspects to consider when
starting with Google Ads as an early-stage B2B startup.

For context, this guide is co-authored by
[Agata](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agatakrzysztofik/) who has 15+ years of
hands-on paid search experience working with multiple B2B SaaS companies (plus
being an Ex-Googler).

Before diving headfirst into Google Ads, ensure it’s the right fit for your
business.

While we believe Paid search should NOT be among your initial channels, it’s a
great channel after initial traction (we will touch on Who & When to use
Google ads in more detail later).

Google Ads are great if:

  * You have a clear understanding of your [Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile).

  * You know in which market category you are operating.

  * Your target audience is searching for solutions like yours online.

  * You have defined your USPs (Unique Selling Points)

  * You can spend at least 25-50 Euros daily to test and optimize your campaigns.

Google Ads is a fantastic tool for reaching high-intent users at the exact
moment they're looking for a solution. But it's not for everyone.

Here’s when you might want to hold off:

  * Your product is so niche that people aren’t searching for it (yet).

  * Your budget is too small (think less than 20 Euros/day).

  * You’re not prepared to invest time in conversion tracking setup or regular optimizations.

The bottom line: if your audience is actively searching and you have the
budget to test, Google Ads can be a powerful tool for growing your startup.

Ready to get started? Let’s talk setup.

First things first: **conversion tracking**.

Without it, you’re flying blind.

Conversion data helps Google’s algorithms understand what’s working and what’s
not, allowing you to optimize your campaigns for better outcomes, such as
qualified leads or sales.

Here’s how to get it right:

Use [GTM](https://tagmanager.google.com/) to manage all your tracking tags in
one place. It's a free tool that makes your life easier.

Setting up your conversion actions using GTM is a more reliable tracking
method than importing conversions from Google Analytics (GA4).

For the initial GTM setup, you will need support from your Developer.

By setting up dedicated conversion actions under " Goals " in Google Ads, you
can track key actions like form submissions, demo requests, and trial sign-
ups.

You can follow this [step-by-step
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGlqxkpYVMs) to set it up and add
values for your conversion actions.

Defining values for your conversion is important because it helps to more
accurately optimize your campaigns towards the actual business impact. [Google
offers a free
calculator](https://ads.google.cn/intl/en_us/home/tools/conversion-value-
calculator/) that will help you calculate the correct values.

Google offers enhanced tracking for more accuracy, even when cookies are
blocked.

With enhanced conversions, first-party customer data like an email address or
phone number is collected through your conversion tracking tags, encrypted,
and sent to Google.

Google then uses this encrypted data to match your customers to their signed-
in Google accounts when they interact with your ads. This makes a difference.

Follow this [Google Ads tutorial for
instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oTZ81boJy0) on how to set up
enhanced conversions.

Since March 2024, for companies operating in Europe implementing [Google
Consent Mode
V2](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10000067?hl=en&sjid=12673974314566622912-EU)
is mandatory. If you don’t implement it Google will block you from collecting
any data about EU and UK users in your Google Analytics audience lists. This
means you won’t be able to use Remarketing campaigns.

Luckily the implementation is not that complex.

If you are a European startup, you probably already have a consent banner on
your website. Chances are that the consent management platform (CPM) behind
your banner has a dedicated partnership with Google (you can find a full list
of [Google’s CPM partners at the bottom of this
article](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/14546213?hl=en)). This
makes the implementation fairly straightforward.

For example, here is the[ step-by-step tutorial on how you can implement it in
GTM with CookieBot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ3k60cz4aE).

You should set up offline conversions if your leads typically convert offline
(like sales calls) or if you want to track more meaningful conversion actions
(like MQLs or SQLs).

This is where tools like [HubSpot](https://hubspot.sjv.io/EK723W) or Zapier
come in handy.

If you use [HubSpot](https://hubspot.sjv.io/EK723W), as your CRM tool, you can
easily connect it to your Google Ads account. Once both are connected, you
will be able to track the impact of your campaigns on the business results in
Hubspot, as well as set up Offline Conversions. Just follow [these
instructions](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10324795?hl=en).

The biggest issue for many early-stage SaaS startups is poor conversion
tracking.

Example: They optimize their ads based on form submissions, which were tracked
using conversion imports from GA4. While that’s okay, it is not the best
method and was not the best goal to focus on.

Better: Implement offline conversion tracking using
[HubSpot](https://hubspot.sjv.io/EK723W), which allows you to track more
critical goals like MQLs, Sales Opportunities, and Customers.

A well-structured Google Ads account is key to driving performance and making
managing your campaigns easier. Here’s how to do it:

Start with a max of two campaigns that target different segments. For example,
one campaign could target competitor keywords, and another could focus on
product category keywords. Don’t create too many campaigns. When you don’t
have enough data in your Google Ads account, too much traffic segmentation
into different campaigns will make it harder for Smart Bidding to work
correctly. This can lead to higher costs and reduced effectiveness.

Each campaign should have separate ad groups focusing on specific keywords or
themes (e.g., "sales pipeline automation" or "lead nurturing software").

Create one ad group per creative theme: keywords, ad copy, and the landing
page of a particular ad group.

Again, don’t overdo it by creating too many ad groups.

A good hack is to structure your campaigns and ad groups according to your
website.

Let’s take the example of Miro.

Under their website navigation, you will find “Use Cases”.

Miro could have one Google Ads campaign called MOFU-Search-UseCases, and under
this campaign, the following Ad Groups:

  * Diagramming, Roadmapping, Agile Practices, Product Planning, Prototyping, Cloud Visualization, Customer Journey Mapping: 

With Responsive Search Ads (RSA) you don’t need to create multiple ad
variations. RSAs allow you to add 15 headlines and 4 descriptions per ad
variation.

For example, imagine you're an HR platform wanting to advertise your SaaS.

With responsive search ads, you can input various headlines like "Easy Leave
Management," "Top HR Solution 2024," or "Start Your 14-Day Trial".

Similarly, you can add multiple descriptions, including special offers, CTAs,
or unique selling points.

Google Ads then tests all the headline and description combinations, showing
your potential customers the most relevant messages based on their search
queries. I suggest starting with one ad variation per ad group to give Google
the chance to identify the winning combinations quickly. It’s good to remember
that 15 unpinned RSA headlines (this is how many you can add per one ad
variation) result in 210 two-headline combinations and 2730 three-headline
combinations.

For Google to evaluate the performance, it needs around 100 impressions for
each combination, which means 300k impressions. That’s why you shouldn’t
overdo it by creating too many ad creatives when you start.

Let’s use a B2B SaaS startup in the sales automation industry as an example.
They have a monthly Google Ads budget of **9,000 Euros**. Here’s how we would
allocate it:

  * **4,900 Euros** for high-intent product category and use case search keywords.

  * **1,800 Euros** for competitor keywords.

  * **2,300 Euros** for remarketing and brand campaigns.

**Why did we split it like that?**

For a brand operating in a competitive market (where competitors can bid on
your brand keywords), we suggest allocating 20-25% of the budget to the brand
campaign. If your brand is not known and nobody is bidding on it, this
percentage can be lower (e.g., 10%), and you can spend more on remarketing
campaigns. The high-intent product category campaign will probably be your
highest converting campaign, so we suggest allocating 60-70% of the budget
there. Last but not least is the competitor campaign, where we suggest
allocating 20-30% of the monthly budget (competitor keywords might be
expensive, so allocating more budget might increase your cost per
acquisition).

If you’re just starting, spending **25-50 Euros daily** is a good rule of
thumb.

For competitive market categories like CRM, human resources, or project
management software, you may need to allocate **50-500 Euros per day** to
obtain meaningful data and see results.

To see how competitive your keywords are and estimate the needed budget, you
could use the Keyword Planner (you will find it inside Google Ads). This tool
will give you insights into the average bid you should expect for your
keywords.

In the screenshot below, we see that “HR software” has a significantly higher
top-of-page bid than, for example, “CRM Software.”

Your Google Ads account is set up, and you know how much you want to spend.

Now, what campaigns should you launch first?

Start with **Search campaigns** targeting high-intent keywords. These are the
keywords that show strong intent to convert.

Bid on search terms related to your competitors. For example, you could target
terms like "Gong alternatives" or "Salesforce competitors."

A good start is to build a comprehensive list of all your competitors and do
Google research on how their ads perform. You could then use the [Ad
Transparency Center](https://adstransparency.google.com/?region=DE) to get
insight into their ads and ad copies.

The next step is doing keyword research using Keyword Planner. Use the
“[competitor name] alternative” or “[competitor name] competitors” to identify
the search volume they get.

When running competitor campaigns it’s crucial not to make these two mistakes:

**Mistake 1:** Bidding for navigational or informational keywords like
“login,” “dashboard,” or “billing”. Make sure you exclude those using negative
keyword lists.

**Mistake 2:** Using a competitor's name inside of your ad copy (RSA
headlines) without first checking if a trademark doesn’t protect this brand.
Overall, you don’t want to start a fight with your competitors, so it’s always
better to create neutral ad copies without using the competitor's brand in
them.

Target keywords that relate to your product category. For instance, “sales
automation software” or “AI tools for research.”

Once you know who your competitors are, you can check which category keywords
they are using in their ads and which category they are listed in on Capterra
or G2.

Go even more granular by targeting specific use cases. For example,
“transcribe Zoom calls,” “automate lead nurturing,” or “payroll management.”

We recommend starting with keyword research and looking for the keywords
across all three categories:

  1. Competitor

  2. product category, 

  3. and use case. 

Then organize them inside a Google Sheet and map them to potential campaigns
and ad groups. See an example of Agata's keyword research for a HR Software:

Here’s something you don’t want to overlook: brand keywords.

If your brand is operating in a competitive market, sooner or later, your
competitors will likely start bidding on your branded keywords.

For example, they might target terms like "[Your brand] alternatives" or
"[Your brand] pricing." Running a brand campaign is crucial to avoid losing
potential customers to your competition. This ensures your business shows up
first when someone searches for your brand name.

Brand campaigns are also essential for startups that haven’t established
strong SEO. If your homepage doesn’t consistently appear at the top of
Google’s search results, running a brand campaign ensures that users searching
for your brand can find you quickly and easily.

Also, some brand names have multiple meanings. Take "Gong," for example. It’s
not just a sales automation company—it’s also a musical instrument. In cases
like this, relying solely on organic traffic might not get your audience to
the right place. Running a brand campaign helps eliminate confusion and
directs users to your website instead of unrelated results.

To make it easier for you to create high-performing ad copy, use the template
below 👇

All you need to do is add up to 15 headlines and up to 4 descriptions.

Google will use these inputs, run various combinations, and come up with the
combination(s) that show the best results.

Once your search campaigns are humming, you can use a **Display campaign** to
branch out to a **Remarketing** campaign.

The remarketing campaign re-engages visitors who have already interacted with
your website. It’s a great way to remind potential customers about your
offering and bring them back into your funnel.

To run remarketing, connect your Google Ads account to Google Analytics 4 and
enable Consent Mode (mentioned before).

Once that’s done, you can build audience lists, such as a list of people who
have visited your website in the past 30 days and haven’t converted. You can
then target this specific list with your image ads, which they will see across
the display network and Gmail.

Target this audience with ads leading to competitor [comparison
pages](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-content-marketing-guide) or
[case studies](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/sales-discovery-101-case-
studies). This will help them understand the value of your solution and will
give them a final push to convert.

Finding the right keywords can make or break your campaigns.

Start with **[Google Ads Keyword
Planner](https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/)**.

It’s a free tool inside Google Ads that helps you find high-volume, high-
intent keywords relevant to your business.

For example, you could feed the tool with your competitor’s website URL to get
ideas for new keywords.

Next, look at what your **competitors** are doing.

Use tools like[ Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/) or  to see which keywords they’re
bidding on. If it’s working for them, it might work for you.

Finally, get some **customer insights**.

Talk to your sales and customer service teams. Listen to call recordings.

What common pain points do they hear? What search terms are prospects using?

These can be a goldmine for keyword ideas.

Don’t forget about **negative keywords**.

These are keywords you want to exclude from your campaigns.

Why? They prevent you from wasting your budget on irrelevant clicks. For
example, if selling a premium SaaS product, you might want to exclude keywords
like “free email marketing tool.”

Once your campaigns run, you’ll want to monitor the numbers closely. Here’s
what to track.

  * **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** : It measures how many people click on your ads. Aim for a CTR of 3-5%.

  * **Conversion Rate (CVR):** This tells you how many clicks lead to conversions. For B2B SaaS, you’ll want a conversion rate of around 1.5% or higher for demo sign-ups or MQLs. For free trial signups, you should aim for at least 7%.

  * **Cost-Per-Acquisition (CPA):** How much are you paying to acquire a customer? Based on your conversion goal, use the conversion rates (e.g. MQL-to-Customer CVR) to calculate the max you are willing to pay for a conversion. You will need it for setting up target CPAs across your campaigns using the Maximize Conversions as a bidding strategy. So you will end up having a maximum you’re willing to pay (e.g. cost per lead, cost per MQL/demo/trial, etc.)

In our case, we aim for:

  * **CTR:** 4% for competitor keywords.

  * **Conversion rate:** 1% for product category keywords and 1.5% and higher for brand keywords

  * **CPA:** 120 Euros for high-intent keywords, which we set up as a target CPA inside of campaigns.

**Looker Studio Templates:** Use one of these templates to visualize your
campaign performance in real time. You can track metrics like CTR and CPA at a
glance.

**Google Ads Scripts:** Automate reporting and gain additional insights into
your campaigns. Scripts can help you identify underperforming keywords or
alert you to sudden changes in performance. Some of the recommended scripts:

  * [Trending Search Terms](https://nilsrooijmans.com/google-ads-script-trending-search-terms/) \- monitor how Google is matching new search terms to your keywords and what is changing in the search behavior of your audience.

  * [RSA Quality Overview](https://adsscripts.com/scripts/google-ads-scripts/rsa-quality-overview) \- get an overview of all Responsive Search Ads in your account with their associated rating.

  * [Quality Score Tracker](https://www.ppc-epiphany.com/2016/03/11/introducing-the-quality-score-tracker-v3-0/) \- you can see how your quality score performs over time.

  * [Link Checker](https://adsscripts.com/scripts/google-ads-scripts/report-link-checker-account?highlight=WyJsaW5rIiwibGlua3MiLCJjaGVja2VyIl0=) \- it alerts you when a landing page on your website is not working, helping you prevent unwanted ad spend (e.g. 404 error).

Google Ads can be a game-changer for early-stage B2B startups—if you use it
right.

Focusing on high-intent keywords, properly tracking conversion, and
effectively structuring your campaigns can drive real business results.
