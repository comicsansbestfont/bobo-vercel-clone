While I see a lot of people sending ‘Emails’ on LinkedIn, I believe this is
not working.

Engaging with prospects via LinkedIn is different from selling through Email.

**💡 LinkedIn sequences are NOT email sequences sent on LinkedIn.**

LinkedIn is a social platform, so you need to adapt your prospecting approach
based on the channel. It’s not enough to simply copy & paste your email
sequence to LinkedIn.

**Here are a few differences I see on LinkedIn (compared to Email):**

✅ shorter messages (only 1-2 short sections) —> Make it easy to read on the
rather small chat window on LinkedIn

✅ no signature —> That’s why you need a good LinkedIn profile, it’s your
signature.

✅ less formatting (no bullet points, empty lines, bold text, etc.)

✅ more informal language (it’s more of a social chat)

✅ it’s okay to use greetings like “Hey (first name)” - instead of (last name)

✅ messages split into multiple smaller messages

When it comes to building the actual campaign (the steps and messages), I’ve
seen some very good results in ‘splitting’ my beloved [TAPSA
framework](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-perfect-cold-email-
tapsa-framework) (for Cold Emails) into multiple separate LinkedIn messages.
* * *

**A quick reminder of the TAPSA Framework:**

TAPSA is an acronym for Trigger, Assume Pain, Solution, Action. Each is one
part of the first cold email. (learn more about it here: [TAPSA
framework](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-perfect-cold-email-
tapsa-framework))
* * *

In between each of the LinkedIn messages you wait for a few days if they
respond. That’s the intention of your first messages. You want them to respond
to you, so you can start a conversation with them (and slowly qualify them) -
and not primarily a conversion like booking a call or free trial.

If they respond, it’s about you to qualify further and once they say they have
a problem or are interested in learning more, you can start to pitch and offer
a CTA.

But if your prospects do not respond after your first messages, you should
change your strategy and start to tease/pitch your solution.

**💡 So compared to Email, LinkedIn is playing ‘slow’.**

So instead of sending one long TAPSA-style LinkedIn message, you cut it down
into smaller separated messages.

  * LinkedIn message 1 = Trigger part

  * LinkedIn message 2 = Assume the pain

  * LinkedIn message 3 = Assume the pain (Emphasize)

  * LinkedIn message 4 = Pitch the solution (Teaser)

  * LinkedIn message 5 = Pitch the solution (Emphasize)

You know I love acronyms - that’s why I call it _**TPPSSB Framework**_.

_**TPPSSB**_ stands for:

  * **Trigger**

  * **Pain**

  * **Pain**

  * **Solution**

  * **Solution**

  * **Break-Up**

You can easily adapt this 7-step LinkedIn sequence for your business to book
more meetings with your [Ideal
Customers](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/framework-ideal-
customer-profile).

Okay, let’s break down each of the steps.

The first step of the sequence is to connect with the prospects (if they are
not part of your network yet).

Unless you can make your invite text super personalized and relevant, I would
recommend sending the invite without a text (you will see higher conversion
rates).

If your accept rate is below 30%, you need to adapt your strategy (better aim
for 50% plus).

Bonus: You can also add a ‘Visit Profile’ step before you send the LinkedIn
Invite. But as [LinkedIn limits](https://www.leadloft.com/blog/linkedin-
limits?utm_campaign=none&utm_source=none&utm_medium=none&utm_content=%2Fblog%2Flinkedin-
limits) your weekly actions, I would skip this step.

Here is where it gets specific for each of your campaigns. Make use of trigger
events / intent data ([17 trigger events / intent data for your
outreach](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-perfect-cold-email-
tapsa-framework)) - doing so will increase the chance that you reach out to
prospects at the right time PLUS that your product is relevant to them.

**Trigger (Intent):**

> _“Hey Alex, great to be connected. I saw that you recently started as Head
> of Sales in your company. Good to be connected with other sales leaders.”_

>  _“Hey Alex, we both joined the X event last week. Great to be connected. I
> loved the speech of Y - what was your favorite?”_

>  _“Hey Alex, congrats on your new funding. Just read about it on
> Techcrunch.”_

>  _“Hey Alex, I saw you commented on X post about XYZ topic. I found it very
> useful, as I think 24/7 about the topic. I am wondering if X is a burning
> topic for you?”_

 _— >_ could also be part of the Invite message

So you get the point. You use a recent trigger event / intent data (which is
customer-centric) to engage. It’s not about you, it’s about them.

Now you wait 2-3 days and see if they respond. If yes - you start to manually
qualify further by asking questions. If not, your LinkedIn Sequence automation
moves on with Message 2.

Now you assume a pain (that is related to the trigger event) you know your ICP
feels.

Let’s assume you’re selling Cold Calling Software (just a random example).
Then you assume the pain for new sales leaders is that their SDR teams can’t
reach enough leads, as it takes them a lot of manual work to copy and paste
numbers in their CRM and log call notes.

**Assume Pain**

Here is how this could sound for the different triggers:

> “ _Hey Alex, I’ve talked to 50+ sales leaders in the last few weeks and what
> they told me is that most struggle to hit revenue goals because their SDR
> teams can’t book enough meetings, as it takes them on average of 10 minutes
> to call prospects and track call notes in their CRM._
>
> _Is this also what you’re seeing?”_

> “ _Hey Alex, as you also joined the X event last week, I assume you’re
> always looking for ways to improve your sales team's performance. One highly
> underrated topic is the efficiency of your SDR team - did you know that it
> takes them on average 10 minutes to call a prospect and take notes in your
> CRM? “_

> “ _Hey Alex, now with your new funding I am sure you’ve set yourself very
> ambitious growth goals and your SDR team will play a crucial role for
> success. Most SDRs reach fewer prospects a day than possible, as they spend
> on average 10 minutes calling and tracking per prospect. Is your SDR also
> complaining about it?”_

If they do not respond to your first ‘pain message’ it’s time to _**place your
fingers deeper into the wound.**_

You do this by sharing additional information that emphasizes your previous
statement (this could be third-party articles, your research, studies,
whitepapers, or interviews). The goal is to share some additional material
that emphasizes the importance.

**Emphasize Pain**

>  _“Forbes recently shared a study that says that SDR teams without modern
> call software perform 34% worse. I thought it’s interesting for you: LINK”_

>  _“We recently asked 50 Head of Sales about the importance of a dedicated
> SDR call software - here’s the link to the blog: LINK. What’s your view on
> it?”_

>  _“Companies like Testimonial 1 and Testimonial 2 increased their SDR
> performance by 42% with a modern call software - as you’re new in the role,
> I thought it could be interesting to share: LINK”_

If they don’t respond after Step 3, you’re mentally switching to another
approach. It’s about pitching your solution. Of course, this is not ideal, as
you did not get any sign of interest, but if done correctly, it still works.

It’s important to still think about ‘Teaser’ your Solution. It’s not a full
pitch. It’s your 1-sentence value proposition.

**Teaser Solution**

>  _“We’re building the next-gen SDR cold calling software for fast-growing
> tech companies (like you). SDR teams on average reach 34% more prospects a
> day using X. Companies like X, Y, Z already trust us. Are you interested in
> learning more?”_

>  _“One way to improve the SDR performance is to use cold calling software
> that integrates with your CRM (Hubspot, Close, Salesforce), automatically
> tracks call notes, and has an auto-dialer functionality for super efficient
> cold calling hours. Can I send you a 30-second demo video?”_

This is your last message before your final break-up message. Try to add
another flavor to your ‘pitch’.

**Emphasize Solution**

> “ _Our new auto-dialer feature lets SDR teams call lead lists straight from
> your CRM. All they need to do is to select a lead list and click on ‘auto-
> dial’. We see that our customers can do 23 calls per hour, instead of 13.
> Here’s a quick video explaining the feature: Link._
>
> _Let me know if I should show you how your team can do the same.“_

>  _“I’m sure one of your key priorities is to increase the meetings booked by
> your SDR team for your AE team. While social selling is growing, cold
> calling still works very well - especially if you use modern calling
> software like X. What kind of call software do you use at Y?_

Options are:

  * Highlighting a specific feature

  * Sharing a case study

  * Sending a personalized (Loom) video

  * Sharing a short presentation

This is your last message. Don’t make the mistake and bothering your prospects
with angry messages (why they don’t respond) or some stupid assumptions like
(” _seems like increasing your revenue is not a priority for you”_).

Instead, make a good last impression. Don’t close the door forever. Keep the
door open wide.

A good break-up email aims for:

**Break-Up**

>  _“Seems like you’re still super busy in the first weeks of your new job. If
> you have more time in the future, happy to discuss with you how modern SDR
> call software can improve your SDR performance. PS: Here are 10 great tips
> to XXX: Link - in case this is helpful 🙂”_

>  _“Promise this is my last message. Seems like my messages did not resonate
> with you, usually this happens because of one of the following reasons._
>
> _1 - you already have a modern call software_
>
>  _2 - you’re the wrong person to talk about ut_
>
>  _3 - I’m interested, but it’s not the right timing atm_
>
>  _1,2, or 3? PS: Here are 10 great tips to XXX: Link - in case this is
> helpful 🙂”_

add email or phone as an additional channel.

Don't make the following mistakes:

❌ not tracking any (relevant) KPIs

❌ tracking 100s of KPIs

Instead, focus on the most relevant metrics for your SaaS business.
