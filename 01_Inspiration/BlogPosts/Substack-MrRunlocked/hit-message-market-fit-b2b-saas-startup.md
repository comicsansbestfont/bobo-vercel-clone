There are only 2 reasons why you can't sell your product.

1️⃣ Your product is bad or useless

2️⃣ Your [messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-
messaging-framework) is not resonating with your target customer.

Number 1️⃣ is when you don't have product-market fit (PMF).

Number 2️⃣ is when you don't have a message-market fit.

To be successful, you need to have both.

So you've got a great product but you're not sure how to market it or who to.

Hitting Message-Market Fit is the most important B2B SaaS sales challenge to
overcome for early-stage startups, enabling you to grow your sales with paying
customers.

Together with [Manuel Hartmann
](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hartmannmanuel/)I’ve hosted a live Masterclass
about Message-Market Fit.

What you'll learn:

✅ Common go-to-market mistakes and how you can avoid them

✅ The 5 key actions B2B Startups can take now to hit message-market fit

**Don’t have time to watch the masterclass? Key takeaways: 👇**

Message-market fit is like Love ❤️

If you found it, you just feel it.

And for all of you who prefer specifics.

**You hit message market fit if:**

1️⃣ 15%+ response rate on outbound messages

2️⃣ "Ahh, that sounds interesting" - something you will hear from prospects

3️⃣ High CTR on Ads (2-5%)

4️⃣ High Website Conversion Rate (above 1%)

If you don't know if you should target the end user or the decision-maker,
then keep this rule of thumb in mind.

The question is about the Top-down vs. bottom-up sales approach.

𝗕𝗼𝘁𝘁𝗼𝗺-𝘂𝗽

Try to approach the user directly (bottom-up) if a single user gets value from
using your product.

This means he/she doesn't need other colleagues or team members to use the
product as well.

Your product delivers value to a single user.

Win one user, make them happy, and then upsell to the whole organization.

Examples: Writing assistants (e.g. [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/)) or
scheduling tools ([Calendly](https://calendly.grsm.io/notion)) or design tools
([Canva](http://partner.canva.com/alexnotion)).

𝗧𝗼𝗽-𝗗𝗼𝘄𝗻

If your product only makes sense, if all team members or the whole
organization is using your product, then go for a top-down sales approach.

You need to convince the decision-maker to roll out the tool in the company.

Only if the whole team/org is using your product, it brings value.

Example: CRM tool (e.g. [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/)) or HR operating
tool (e.g. [Personio](https://www.personio.de/))

Note: In challenging economic times (recessions, layoffs, etc.), you most
probably need to include the decision maker in the buying process.

I know, this growth tip is different from what I normally share.

But I am a big believer that books & podcasts are a great way to always learn
new things.

So I believe this is actually a super actionable growth tip for you. For your
personal growth but also to grow your business.
