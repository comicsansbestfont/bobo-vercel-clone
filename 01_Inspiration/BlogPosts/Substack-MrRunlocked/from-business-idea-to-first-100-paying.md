In the last two weeks, I've got approached several times if I can share a
high-level guide on the steps from validating your business idea to winning
your first 100 paying customers. So here we go: _From business idea to first
100 paying customers in a nutshell._

Simply follow the link in each section to get more information on each of the
steps.

We all like to come up with new business ideas. And that's great. But before
you spend time on actually building a product and wasting your time or money,
think about ways to validate your business idea and get strong signals that
are worth spending your time on.

**Here is the process I highly recommend to validate your business idea:**

  * Step 1: Write down core assumptions and hypotheses

  * Step 2: Rank your hypotheses (hypothesis score)

  * Step 3: Research the market (size)

  * Step 4: Market testing with customer interviews

  * Step 5: Run experiments around your hypotheses

    * Popular types of MVPs include _'concierge' or service MVP,_ _Landing Pages (with sign-ups and waitlists), Physical prototype, Pre-sales, Crowdfunding, and Product Hunt_

    * Define upfront what a successful MVP looks like (success metric) for you and write it down. This can be for instance _#signups, pre-sales revenue, conversion rates_

For most of the steps, especially for building [a great landing
page](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/10-landing-page-tips-to-
increase), doing customer interviews, or having a waitlist, it's helpful to
rely on great software tools. Check out my list of _[Best tools for Startups
and digital creators](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/best-tools-
for-start-ups-and-digital)_ for more information.

Once you've validated your business idea, it's time to launch and market your
product.

P.S. Already think about ways to build an (engaged) audience from the
beginning. Great ways to [build an
audience](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-content-marketing-guide)
are mailing lists, Facebook groups, slack channels, or simply running
webinars, a youtube channel, or blogging.

money and time](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-validate-
your-idea-before)

I recently came across a Medium article on a [playbook for building and
launching a startup in 30 days.](https://medium.com/swlh/my-playbook-for-
building-and-launching-a-startup-in-30-days-fae08c528577) If you follow the
steps you can pretty quickly validate your idea.

Your [ideal customer profile (ICP)](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-
ideal-customer-profile) is a core element of your [go-to-market
strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/go-to-market-
strategy-8-steps-for) and crucial for your sales and marketing success.
Knowing your ICP helps you to keep focused and spend your resources (time and
money) on talking to the right people.

You will see that having a clear ICP results in high-quality leads that will
show better conversion rates (because they resonate with your messaging, [your
value proposition](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-
framework), and your product), and in a shorter sales cycle, and more happy
paying customers (with a higher NPS score). This also means that fewer
customers will churn (lower churn rate) because they see the value in your
product, and you will see more referrals coming in. So you will increase your
average customer lifetime value.

Great ways to reduce the number of users that do not fit your ideal customer
profile are:

  * Sign-up forms (asking for relevant information e.g. #employees or industry)

  * Sales commission structure (more commission for customers from your ICP)

  * Analyzing existing customers and identifying patterns (lead sources, countries, roles..)

I'm referring to a great model by **[Myk Pono (Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):
How To Create A Comprehensive Customer
Profile)](https://www.mykpono.com/ideal-customer-profile-icp-how-to-create-a-
comprehensive-customer-profile/) t**hat says, that your ICP feels the pain,
has a fit to your product, and is ready to buy.

👉 **ICP = Pain + Fit + Readiness**

They have the problem you’re trying to solve for them (Pain). And the way
you’re trying to solve their problem resonates with them (Fit), meaning your
product (how) is the right solution for them. On top of that, they need to be
ready for your product - meaning the timing needs to be right (Readiness).

**5 practical steps to create your ideal customer profile:**

  * Step 1: Create a dream list of 100 customers

  * Step 2: Collect information about the Buyer Persona and Users

  * Step 3: A day in the life of your customer (doing a mix of interviews, surveys, and job shadowing to get information about: _daily activities, responsibilities, goals & success KPIs)_

  * Step 4: Understand customer behavior (Knowing how they think, what they care about, and what they are doing including questions like _What software tools are they using?, What partnerships do they have?, Who else is also selling a complimentary service/product to them? )_

  * Step 5: Trigger events (The right triggers signal to you that your ICP needs your solution now)

Once your business idea is validated and you know your [ideal customer profile
(ICP)](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile), it's
time to market your product and win your first paying customers. Step 3 (win
your first 10 customers) and step 4 (Launch with a powerful go-to-market
strategy) normally run in parallel at the same time.

Winning your first 10 customers should be relatively easy if you follow these
8 tips:

  1. **Solve a real problem**

So instead of building a product and then trying to find a customer group who
is interested in such a product, start with a well-defined problem from a
specific target customer and build a product/solution for them. If you don't
solve a really big problem, go back to the validation phase.

  1. **Start with strategies that do NOT scale**

I would highly recommend starting manual hand recruiting your first 10
customers by doing stuff that does NOT scale (e.g. Outbound Sales, phone
calls, emails, etc...).

  1. **Be human and don’t sell your product in the first step**

In order to win the first customers, you don't need to have the ‘perfect’
sales pitch. My experience is the more natural and human you are in your cold
outreach the more successful you will be.

  1. **Find customers, who love your product**

Don’t make the mistake of onboarding hard customers or just anyone who is
interested but does not fit your ideal customer profile.

  1. **Avoid hard customers**

If it's getting hard for you to win your first customers, this is a strong
indicator that you most probably do not really solve an existing problem for
your customers. Start iterating again.

  1. **Qualify your customers - don't sell to every interested prospect**

Declining interested prospects can help you to focus on the right customers. A
good way to do this is to ask prospects 3-5 qualifying questions - depending
on their answers you can easily decide if those are the right fit or not.

  1. **Charge your first customers**

I would highly suggest charging your customers from day one. Otherwise, you do
not know if your customers really see value in your product and are willing to
pay later on for it. My recommendation is: 'Charge your client in order to
solve their problem' - if they only want to use your product for free this is
a strong indicator that the problem is not big enough for them.

  1. **Ask for referrals**

Referrals are a great way to grow from 10 to 100 paying customers. So ask your
customers proactively for referrals.

[Winning your first 10 paying
customers](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/8-tips-how-to-get-your-
first-10-paid) should be a manual process. It's all about learning and getting

[Hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/gtm-strategy) defines a go-to-market
strategy (GTM) as “a step-by-step plan created to successfully launch a
product to market”. What it means is that your GTM strategy defines how you
literally connect your product with your potential customers.

Your go-to-market strategy covers the questions around...

  1. How do you communicate your value proposition to the market (brand messaging & [sales messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-framework))

  2. How do you sell the product to your ICP and make them happy (product-led vs. sales-led)

  3. What [growth channels](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-21-saas-gtm-channels) & growth activities work best for your product
