Being product-led vs. following a sales-led growth strategy is a totally
different game. That’s why being intentional help you grow your business. You
can take better decisions on your product roadmap, on your hiring plan (what
kind of profiles you need) as well as on your sales and marketing initiatives.

The decision, If you should follow a product-led or sales-led (or maybe a
hybrid model) is mainly based on your positioning in the market and the
segment you are hunting.

4 criteria that help you take the decision (product-led growth vs. sales-led
growth vs. hybrid model)

  * how your customers actually want to buy your product (not what you personally prefer)

  * the complexity of your product // how easy can you deliver the value

  * the complexity and length of the buying process

  * the price point of your product

The more complex the product, the longer the sales cycle, and the more
expensive your product, the better a sales-led strategy for you (and vice-
versa).

Choosing the wrong [pricing
strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-pricing-strategy) is
one of the most common startup mistakes.

Oftentimes there is a misalignment between pricing and the value of the
product (pricing is not based on the value metric). Not charging based on the
value of your product also leads to undercharging (increasing prices can
positively affect your conversions).

When choosing your [pricing model (flat-rate vs. usage-based vs. tiered
pricing)](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/10-hands-on-tips-for-
saas-pricing?r=cw3s1), make sure your pricing is aligned with the different
target personas (different needs) and scales with the value metric (e.g.
number of bookings, revenue, requests, minutes, features, seats...).

product](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-pricing-strategy).

If not, you will struggle with your marketing and barely find clients.

Having a **powerful 1-sentence value proposition** is super helpful.

Below, are great 1-sentence value proposition drafts you can use to explain
your business in simple language and be on point👇.

> _**We enable/empower/help [ICP] to [Main Result] by [Solution]**_

> _**We, [company XYZ], create software/platform for [ICP] that
> enables/empowers/helps them to [Main Result] by [How]**_

> _**My/our product/service helps [the target group] who want [jobs to be
> done] by [minimizing a pain] and [maximizing a gain] unlike [your
> competitors]**_

Having a powerful 1-sentence value proposition is key for all your sales and
marketing communication (Sales emails, Onboarding Email sequences, Cold Calls,
etc.).

Be conscious about the steps of your customers and where they are in your
funnel. Write down the journey (or better draw the customer journey, e.g.
using a miro board) and decide on what should happen at each step in the
journey (e.g. drip email, outbound call, webinar, etc.) and who owns it (e.g.
marketing).

Having a clearly defined north star metric gives you direction and helps you
to focus on things that drive impact. OKRs as a framework are great to align
the whole team on making sure that everyone knows how they positively impact
the north star metric.

You need to know first who your [ideal customer
profile](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile) is,
what pains they have, to know how you can help them to release their pain
(your value proposition). Only after that, you should think about the best
growth channels.

Get specific about the following for a powerful
[ICP](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-powerful-
ideal-customer):

  * Firmographics (company size, revenue, number of employees, industry, location, etc.)

  * Pain points

  * Buyer persona

  * Understand customer behavior

    *  _What software tools are they using?_

    * _What partnerships do they have?_

    * _Who else is also selling a complimentary service/product to them?_

    * _What content/website/newsletter do they read?_

    * _Who are they following? What events are they taking part in?_

    * _Who do they want to become? Who are their role models?_

If you are just starting with your business, don’t spend time automating
things or testing highly scalable things. Focus on manual things like
personalized emails, cold calls, LinkedIn messages, comments on relevant
social media posts, or posting on communities where your ideal customer
profile hangs out.

If sales demos or cold calls don’t convert, paid ads will not work either.

The Pareto rule says that 20% of the input is responsible for 80% of the
output. Being aware of that lets you focus on the right things. Find out what
your 20% most valuable activities are and try to scale them (especially in
early-stage with limited resources, the focus is king).

What is the one growth channel we need to master? What are the core features
that really drive value to the customers? And what are rather nice to have
things you can or should do later?

Today there are so many different [growth
channels](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-21-saas-gtm-channels) on how you
could reach your target audience.

But mastering all of them needs a lot of resources and a lot of testing. So
sometimes it makes sense to test different growth channels and once you find a
channel that works (great conversion rates + healthy CACs), focus your energy
and resources on really mastering this channel (and stop with the others).

No one likes to be ‘lost’. But if they sign up and don’t know what to do with
your tool, they feel lost. So make your onboarding smooth and easy to follow.
Great tools are checklists, progress bars, help center academy, and email
automation (based on user behavior).

You need to measure your sales funnel and conversion rates.

> “**You can't improve what you don't measure**.” (Peter Drucker)

Focus on the parts that need to improve.

Based on your sales motion (product-led vs. sales-led) I would recommend
measuring at least the following:

Of course, you should measure input metrics like #calls #emails #blogs
published as well.

Don’t expect you better know what your customers want - be close to them and
listen carefully.

In order to always increase the value of your product, you need to become more
valuable to them. That means that you are building the right product that
helps them to increase revenue, reduce costs or improve productivity.

But how do you make sure that you are always close to them and learn from
them?

Here are some ways to do so:

  1. Even if you are not in support or sales, have regular calls with customers

  2. Analyze customer feedback (e.g. support chat, churn reasons, online reviews, social media, etc.)

  3. Survey your customers (e.g. NPS survey) but also churns and non-converting leads

  4. Run webinars, offer live chat or support hotline

Regular NPS surveys are so great to know what your customers think.

☠️ Churn kills growth! So if you want 2-3x SaaS growth rates, you need to
reduce your churn rate.

You can try to prevent churn using churn alerts.

Analyze the behavior (e.g. product usage) and characteristics (e.g. company
size, industry, lead source, etc.) of your churned customers.

Do you find patterns? Can you identify red-flag activities?

Use those patterns to analyze existing customers and get early alerts.

Implement churn prevention activities (e.g. free training, activation emails,
etc.) to reduce your churn rates.

Once your paying customers cancel, ask them why. Send automatically triggered
emails with a quick survey (and the option to book a call with you).

Offer them a dropdown with churn reasons and an open text field for further
info about why they cancel. So make it super easy and fast to give you
feedback.

Based on the churn reason, you can personalize your follow-up and maybe even
win back some of the churns:

  * too expensive —> one-off discount

  * too complex —> Customer Success call / Free Training

  * missing feature —> share product roadmap

Similar to surveying churn customers, you should also learn why leads are not
converting to paying customers. Especially if you offer free trials, learn
what’s missing for them to become a paying customer.

Go through the list of churn reasons and non-converting reasons at least once
a month. Come up with initiatives for those reasons.

Don’t stop selling once the customer is paying. Always restate the benefits
for the customer using your product.

Here are some examples where you can restate your value proposition:

Highlight what your customer achieved (value metric of your product e.g. x
email sent, y € revenue made, z websites designed, etc) in the last billing
period.

This one is more obvious. But use the dashboard of your product to highlight
the main metrics that are important for your customers.

Everyone likes to get positive messages. So why don’t send your customers
frequent updates on how they are doing? Or maybe even give them a call (for
larger accounts).

👉 Curious to learn: What works best for you to restate your value proposition?

Especially if you are product-led, be sure you know the aha moment of your
product. Once you know the aha moment, you can work on your activation
strategy to increase your conversions from sign-up to paying customers.

Creating a lock-in effect helps you to keep your customers and to increase the
value of your product. Probably you have heard about the term sticky product.

For social media friends and followers are lock-in effects, for Spotify, it is
creating your own music playlists in the app (which is something you don’t
want to lose, so you are not switching to amazon music). For B2B SaaS
integrations to other tools, lots of historical data and insights (which you
would lose switching to a competitor) and lots of stakeholders (e.g.
colleagues, customers, etc.) using it too.
