Qualifying a lead ultimately means finding out, if:

✅ the lead is the right fit for you and your product

✅ you and your product are a good fit for them

So it’s a mutual decision.

Both parties decide if it’s a good idea to invest more time in the upcoming
sales/buying process (because they know it’s worth the time).

Usually, to collect all the relevant information, qualification consists of 2
parts:

1️⃣ Research (before discovery call)

2️⃣ Discovery Call

To not just follow your gut feeling, it helps to have qualification criteria.

Using a sales qualification method comes with a few benefits:

✅ Gives you and your (growing) sales team a structure to follow

✅ Improves the quality of your discovery

✅ Improves your pipeline quality & forecast accuracy

✅ Foundation for a shared common understanding and language (internally)

Regardless of the exact framework you’re following, I see 5 dimensions of
qualification:

  1. **Ideal Customer**

  2. **Need**

     1. Situation

     2. Problem & Pains

     3. Implications

  3. **Decision Process**

     1. Stakeholders (Champion / Economic Buyer)

     2. Roadmap

  4. **Urgency**

  5. **Competition / Alternative Solutions**

I like to qualify on at least 3 dimensions - regardless of the chosen
qualification method.

Do they belong to the right type of company/persona? And does your product fit
their usecase?

Do you understand their status quo? What is their current solution? And can
you identify a pain/challenge? Plus, do they want to fix the problem? Do you
see a way how you/your product can help them?

Do you have a (basic) understanding of who takes the decision (aka. decision
maker), who drives the deal (aka. champion), and what the process looks like?
Is there a specific timeline or critical event that drives urgency? What are
the criteria for making the decision?

In the end, doing a discovery to qualify a lead is always about:

✅ Getting a deep understanding of their current situation

✅ Identify what is shitty about the current situation (pain)

✅ What it means for them if they don’t fix the problem (implications)

✅ What does a better situation look like for them? Why is this important?

✅ How would they ‘rate’ a good or bad solution?

✅ Is there any urgency to fix it and what will the decision process look like
(who, when, how)?

✅ What are the next steps?

✅ What could block the deal? What are the top objections?

There are a few sales qualification methodologies that will help you better
qualify leads and run a good discovery.

Each of the methodologies follows a bit different approach, but all of them
focus initially on 2 main parts (that are crucial in any discovery):

1️⃣ Understanding the current SITUATION

2️⃣ Identifying a PAIN

Here are 4 sales methods I highly recommend 👇

MEDDIC stands for Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision
Process, Identify Pain, and Champion.

Want to learn more about MEDDIC? Check out [Hubspot’s MEDDIC
article](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/a-step-by-step-guide-to-the-meddic-
sales-qualification-process).

Another very popular one. SPIN stands for Situation, Pain, Implications, Need-
payoff.

Pipedrive wrote a great article on [SPIN
selling](https://www.pipedrive.com/en/blog/spin-selling).

And also check out how [Avoma founder using
SPIN](https://www.avoma.com/blog/sales-discovery-and-demo) to sell their
product.

Developed by Stephanie Sgura, SUGAR stands for Situation, Urgency, Gap
Identification, All Stakeholders and Roadmap.

Blog](https://www.growthmastery.com/post/suga-ar-r-die-erste-customer-centric-
methodik-f%C3%BCr-deinen-gesamten-sales-prozess).

[SPICED framework](https://winningbydesign.com/spiced-framework/) is designed

Decision.

Doing a sales discovery call is the best way to qualify (or also disqualify) a
lead.

Today in software sales you see two ways of selling.

This means you combine the discovery call and the [sales product
demo](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-sales-
product-demos) in one meeting. It’s called disco demo.

Usually, you’ll spend the first part of the meeting doing your discovery,
followed by the demo.

If you follow this 1-step sales process, don’t make the mistake of skipping
your discovery, make sure you still have enough time for your discovery.

If possible try to separate discovery and demos and follow a 2-step sales
process.

You run 2 separate meetings. First, you do a short 15-30 minute discovery
call, then followed by a longer 45-60 minute [sales product
demo](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-sales-
product-demos).

The advantage of a 2-step sales process is:

✅ you have enough time to do a proper discovery

✅ you can personalize your demo (based on your learnings in the disco call)

✅ you can make sure that all relevant stakeholders are involved in the process

Either way, without a proper discovery and the right discovery questions,
you’ll have a hard time collecting all the important information, and you’ll
end up wasting a lot of time with prospects who aren’t ready to buy.

In the next section, I will share with you 24 ready-to-use sales discovery
questions.

But before we do this. I want to share with you one very important note.

Don’t forget to also add value for the prospect in your discovery. Too often I
see SaaS founders and sellers purely focusing on asking all their questions.
But by doing so, they forget to add value for the prospect.

You don’t want your discovery call to be a call where you only ask questions
so that your prospect feels like being in an interrogation.

At the end of the discovery, both parties need to mutually agree that it makes
sense to move on.

So it’s not enough that you only ‘qualify’, you need to give a bit of value
already.

This can come in different ways, e.g.

✅ Highlighting your value proposition (1-sentence value prop)

✅ Sneak preview of your product (5 minutes highlighting main capabilities)

✅ Giving your expert opinion (about their current situation) and sharing how
other customers of yours overcome the challenge (sharing case study)

✅ Sharing (some parts) of your [sales
deck](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-perfect-sales-deck-
template)

Below you will find a list of discovery questions that will help you gain
insights about your prospect and qualify properly.

But before we come to the list, I want to share 2 important insights to keep
in mind.

There is a super interesting stat by [Gong](https://www.gong.io/de/blog/best-
discovery-call-tips/). It shows that successful salespeople get longer answers
to their questions.

So to get long (insightful) responses from buyers, you need to ask open
questions.

[Gong](https://www.gong.io/de/blog/best-discovery-call-tips/) analyzed a lot
of sales calls and found out that the sweet spot is 11-14 questions.

> If you ask too many sales discovery questions, the conversation will feel
> like an interrogation. Too few, and you won’t unearth enough pain points.

I’ve clustered the questions around the main qualification criteria.

This can also include questions about critical criteria for your business.
Some examples:

  * How do you currently deal with [XYZ challenge]?

  * Can you walk me through the current process of [topic/usecase]?

  * Can you help me to understand your current solution to [topic/usecase]?

  * I want to be sure I fully understand how you deal with [topic/usecase]. Can you tell me more about it?

  * What other software products do you use right now [related to this topic]?

  * How satisfied are you with the current solution?

  * What challenges are you facing right now when it comes to [XYZ topic]?

  * Help me understand your biggest challenge when it comes to [XYZ topic]?

  * What effect would it have on you/your company/your costs etc. if you solve [problem]?

  * What would be an ideal result for you 6 months after implementing our tool?

  * What have you done so far to solve the [XYZ challenge]?

  * Why is it so important for you to solve this specific problem? And also why now?

  * Help me to understand: Is there any specific reason why you want to fix the problem right now?

  * What’s your timeline to fix the problem/ implementing a solution?

  * What do you expect from a great solution? What’s essential and what’s less important?

  * Who else needs to be involved in the next steps?

  * Tell me, who is in charge of making the decision? Who needs to be on board?

  * How many people would use the product?

  * What are you doing if you can not solve the [XYZ challenge]? Do you have any other solution in mind?

  * What other solutions do you consider right now?

  * What are the other solutions you are looking at?

Choose one of the sales qualification frameworks and pick the relevant
discovery questions for your product and target audience (SMB vs. enterprise
market).

Then apply them to your business:

**1️⃣ Create a Discovery Cheatsheet (with all the questions)**

Create a document on how you run your discovery and the questions you need to
ask.

Having a cheatsheet helps you to collect all the relevant info and qualify
better (and faster).

**2️⃣ Embed it in your CRM**

This means adding custom fields in your CRM and making them mandatory fields
to move the deal forward in your pipeline.

Additionally, you can add your discovery cheatsheet/list of questions as
templates to your activities (e.g. discovery call activity)

**3️⃣ Record your discovery calls (and demos)**

Review (as a team) your calls and coach each other.
