A powerful ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) for B2B consists of 2 parts:

**1\. The Ideal Company**

**2\. The Ideal Personas (Buyer persona + User Persona)**

Each of the elements needs to be described in the best possible way - the
characteristics, attributes, and criteria that define your ICP.

So let’s break them down together.

Here you get specific about the:

Most of the time you need to deal with multiple personas.

(and of course most of the time there are even more personas involved like
CEO, IT, Procurement, Legal, etc.).

This includes:

  * the exact job titles (e.g. check LinkedIn profiles)

  * the department they work for

  * the team size

  * the education & qualification

  * and interest & hobbies

Now once you know who these people are, we need to get deeper. A great way to
learn more about these people is ‘a day in the life of your customers’. You
will learn about their:

I recommend you get very specific about:

  * what other software tools do they use

  * how they normally purchase products (learn about the decision and purchasing process)

  * who else is selling complimentary products and services to them

  * the top content they consume (websites, newsletters, YouTube channels, people they follow, events, communities, podcasts, etc.)

What can you observe from the outside that gives you a proxy/indicator that
there is a high chance that they face a specific problem (you are going to
solve for them) and they are ready to buy?

Getting all the information about the ICP can be a challenge. Especially if
you don’t have a large amount of customers you can analyze or talk to. So here
are 6 ways to find answers on your ICP.

_**if you already have customers**_

  1. Analyze your CRM data (lost vs. won deals)

Your ideal customers show:

🔸 Higher ACVs

🔸 Shorter Sales Cycles

🔸 Higher Win Rates

  2. Analyze your Product Analytics

Your ideal customers show:

🔸 Show strongest adoption/engagement

🔸 Low(er) Churn rates

🔸 Got the most value from the product

 _**if you do not have customers yet**_

  3. Build your [Dream 100 Customer List](https://www.clickfunnels.com/blog/the-dream-100/)

  4. Market testing (A/B testing with outbound campaigns)

  5. Research communities (to figure out who has the pain points you're solving)

  6. Qualitative feedback from sales calls

👉 Based on the list of ideal companies (you've built with the methods above),
you need to analyze them to find their unique attributes and get insights
about them.

Sometimes it’s not easy to know if you already ‘found’ your ICP.

Good indicators for having a powerful ICP and knowing how to communicate with
them ([message-market fit](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/hit-
message-market-fit-b2b-saas-startup)) and how to keep/make them happy
([product-market
fit](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-3-indicators-that-your-
saas-business)) are:

  1. Increase in conversion rates

🔸 ad conversion rates

🔸 cold email response rates

🔸 website (to demo/signup) conversion

🔸 activation rates

🔸 deal win rates & free trial to paid

🔸 retention rates

  2. Great customer feedback

🔸NPS

🔸customer support interactions

🔸shorter sales cycle (they push actively)

  3. (First signs) of referrals and virality

🔸share and invite others (from the same ICP)

🔸talks about you in niche communities

It can be very helpful to have a profile of companies & personas you DO NOT
WANT as your customers. Someone you should **not** serve - your ANTI-ICP.

These are personas & companies that are NOT a good customer fit for you
because:

❌ don't value your product

❌ don't have a pain or need that you solve for them

❌ don't fit strategically into your business

To find them, ask yourself what type of persona/companies:

❌ have long sales cycle and low win rates?

❌ have low contract values?

❌ high churn rates?

❌ high support volume?

❌ low engagement and satisfaction?

So building your Anti ICP is learning who your best customers are not.

Your Anti-ICP is very helpful when it comes to qualifying your prospects,
either in your sales discovery or in your product onboarding - but also
obviously when it comes to building campaigns.

**Tip** : In a competitive space, consider developing a disruptive pricing
model to establish a leading position in the market.

**Context:** When we launched [Timesact](https://apps.shopify.com/timesact-
discount-pre-order), we entered a market with numerous competitors, each
following one of two prevailing business models:

  * Charging a fixed monthly subscription fee.

  * Employing a freemium model where the first product added to pre-order is free, and users pay according to the number of products they wish to have on pre-order.

Both of these models had their shortcomings, as they charged customers even
when the app didn't bring them any value, such as when customers didn't sell
any pre-orders.

We adopted a different approach by billing customers based on the number of
pre-orders they sold each month (—> awesome example for [value-based
pricing](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-b2b-saas-
pricing-guide))

This approach, combined with great customer support, boosted us to 1st place
in the pre-order category in the Shopify app store.
