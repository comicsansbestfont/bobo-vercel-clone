If your growth relies on outbound sales, you need to nail your outbound
emails.

If not, you will never book relevant sales meetings.

A powerful (cold) email always consists of the following 4 parts (simple
framework):

**Part 1: A clear Why**

Give a clear reason why you reach out.

The reason needs to be buyer-centric.

‘I’m reaching out to you because WE are the market leader in XYZ’ doesn’t
work.’ Because it’s seller-centric and your potential customer doesn’t care
about you.

Make use of trigger events as a reason to reach out.

Trigger events include new funding rounds, changes in leadership, new
product/feature launches, and recent posts on social media...

‼On 17.11.2022 I will share 14 trigger events + 4 tools on
[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-estner/). Follow me and don’t
miss it.

**Part 2: Assume the pain**

Add content that is highly relevant to the prospect. Combine the trigger event
and assume problems that are related to that. Refer to others of this audience
that faced similar challenges after such a trigger event.

If you assume the pain and your prospect faces the same pain, the following
will happen:

  * you position yourself as an expert

  * pitching your solution (part 3 of your email) feels natural and makes sense to them

  * your email is relevant to them

**Part 3: 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗶𝗻**

Now it’s time for your short pitch. Mention how you can help to solve the
(assumed) problem for them.

Your [1-sentence value proposition](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexander-
estner_b2bsaas-valueproposition-saasmarketing-
activity-6960488872795373568-mQdY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
is super powerful for this.

But don't pitch your product, just keep it high level.

The goal is to create interest and curiosity in your service/product, not to
close the deal.

**Part 4: Call to action**

Make it clear what the next step is if they are interested.

Should they reply to your email, click on a link to watch a video or read an
article or book a meeting with you via your booking link?

Make the CTA interest-based. They mostly perform better.

**Bonus tip:**

Keep the email short. 3-4 sections. Each section max. 3 short sentences.

Structure the email in sections and make it easy to read.

Highlight essential parts/words. Remove unnecessary words

Your website is the center of all your sales and marketing activities.

If your [website doesn’t grab the attention of your
visitor](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/how-to-high-converting-saas-homepage),
you will see very low conversion rates.

Both design and [copy](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-homepage-
copywriting-guide), need to be on point.

Nice design, but a bad copy, doesn’t show any significant results.

The ‘above the fold’ section is the section of your website that visitors see
first before they start to scroll down. It’s basically the ‘landing page’ of
your website.

The goal of the ‘above the fold’ section is to grab the attention so that the
visitor stays on your page and continues to read.

On the example of calendly, I will share with you 5 essentials of a great
‘above the fold’ section of your website.

**1/ Explain how your product helps (Title)**

It’s about the benefit of your product or the job to be done. What can I
achieve with the product? What’s in for me / the value you provide

**2/ Explain what it is that you're selling (Subtitle)**

Explain in 1-2 sentences how you create the benefit/value for the customer.
The visitor needs to understand what is it that you’re building? Is it
software, service, plug-in, event, etc.

**3/ Let them see something related (Image)**

Add something visual related to the Title and subtitle. Ideally, it shows
something nice about your product that underlines the value you’ve mentioned
in the title.

Seeing the image helps the visitor to better understand what they read in your
title and subtitle.

**4/ Add trust (Social proof)**

No one likes to be alone or the first one.

By adding social proof you will increase trustworthiness and credibility.

Especially if your customers are NOT early adopters, social proof and trust
(e.g. badges, certificates, reviews) can work really well.

**5/ Call to action**

Make it clear what you want them to do.

If you know the main objections of your customers, add them next to your call
to action.

You basically handle the objections upfront. (e.g no credit card required, get
started in under 5 minutes...).

This will increase your conversion rates.

A lot of times I see early-stage founders talking so much about the great
features and products they are building. Nothing wrong with that of course.

But, if you’re speaking (on your website, sales demo, emails, etc.) to
potential customers, you should not talk about your features (unless they
explicitly asked for it).

Because what they really care about is how you can solve their problems.

How you can transform their business, from the current status to the desired
outcome.

You need to sell the wonderful promising future.

So don't do the same mistake and confuse 𝗳𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 & 𝗳𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀.

You're building great features.

So you can sell great futures.

In the end, people buy results, they buy outcomes, they buy transformations.

1️⃣ If your product is email marketing software, you sell an engaging growing
audience.

2️⃣ If your product is booking software for restaurants, you sell more revenue
and higher utilization.

3️⃣ If your product is a Sales CRM, you sell a full pipeline and higher
conversions (ultimately more revenue).

**Tip:** Don’t hire expensive sales-as-a-service (aka lead/meeting generators)
agencies too early even if you have enough budget and enough pressure from
early investors to accelerate the sales motion and feedback from the market.
And by expensive, I mean anything above the 3-4k threshold.

**Failure** : We’ve hired a 10k/mo agency that promised us a proper GTM
strategy and at least 2 meetings per week. After 2,5 months of back and forth,
we realized that most of their lists were not qualified for outreaches, a lot
of irrelevant accounts. We found out that they had to be micro-managed to
deliver properly, while in the very beginning they sold themselves as an
autonomous machine for paving out GTM and generating leads. In 2,5 months they
brought us 0 leads, not 1, even for a meeting.

**Learning** : Doing founder-led sales myself I was able to have 20+
conversations and signed up 2 customers myself during the same period. No one
will care about and love your product more than you do. So, as I see it now,
the outsourced sales team should only be involved if you can put them on the
rails that you have discovered and tested yourself and you just need low-cost
operational help to scale that out.

P.S. Check out [Comfi](https://comfi.app/) if you want to sell 2x more annual
contracts. They help bootstrapped and seed-stage startups offer their
customers flexible payment options (a.k.a. BNPL for SaaS). They commit to
annual but pay monthly.
