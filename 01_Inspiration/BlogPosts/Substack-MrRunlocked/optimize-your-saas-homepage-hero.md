The hero section is the most important section of your website.

—> [The perfect SaaS Homepage Template](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-
perfect-homepage-for-early-stage-saas)

Your above-the-fold/hero section needs to grab the attention.

But more importantly to give answers to the most important questions visitors
have.

Most visitors decide in a few seconds if they bounce or stay and read the rest
of your homepage.

So if your hero section leaves them with many questions, you will probably
lose them.

**Here are the 7 core elements:**

1️⃣ **Product Category**

What is your product (aka. product category).

2️⃣ **Capabilities / Features / Usecase**

What can I do with the product (capability)?

How can I do this (features)?

When/for what do I need the product (usecase)?

3️⃣ **Benefits**

What is the value of the product? What results can I expect?

4️⃣ **ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)**

Who is the product for? Is it for me?

5️⃣ **Product video/animation**

What does it look like?

**Bonus** :

6️⃣**Social proof/trust**

Who else is using the product? Can I trust them?

Using Capterra badges, G2 reviews, etc., or testimonials or customer logos.

7️⃣ **Objection handling**

Proactively address most common objections (e.g. no credit card required; set-
up in under 10 minutes, 100% GDPR compliant)

To answer these questions, you have the following elements of the hero
section:

  * Your Headline (H1)

  * The text below your H1 (e.g. H2 or description)

  * the text box below your CTA buttons

  * image/video to tease your product

  * CTA

  * Social proof element

Get your product on top review sites like G2, OMR Reviews, Capterra,
SaasGenius, and GetApp.

Here’s a list of the [top 17 SaaS review
sites](https://testimonial.to/resources/top-saas-review-sites).

Being listed on these sites comes with 2 main benefits:

1️⃣ **Strong backlinks (SEO boost)**

Most of these sites have a pretty high domain rating. This means getting a
backlink from them to your site will boost your SEO ranking.

2️⃣ **Increase trust**

Most B2B companies look online for reviews and case studies before they decide
on a new software provider. Being present (with good reviews) on these sites
helps.

To get a good ranking and have an appealing profile on these sites,
reviews/ratings are key.

Ask your existing customers to review your product.

It’s key to ask them at the right moment (when they are happy).

You can ask them:

  1. Right after a successful onboarding session (with customer success) 

  2. Positive NPS rating

  3. Super active user 

  4. Renewal/Upgrade

Ask them to review on your go-to review platform (like Capterra, G2, OMR
Reviews, etc.)
