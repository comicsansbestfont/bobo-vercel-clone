Getting your [first 10 paying
customers](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/8-tips-how-to-get-your-
first-10-paid) for your B2B SaaS business is mostly an unscalable manual
hustle. Doing unscalable things is exactly what you need to do to win your
first 10 paying customers and get your first conviction about your idea.

But to grow beyond that and hit your first 100 paying customers, you need to
shift gears and follow a new strategy.

[Winning your first 10 paying
customers](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/8-tips-how-to-get-your-
first-10-paid) should be a manual process. It’s basically a way for you to
validate your idea and learn who your [ideal
customer](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-powerful-
ideal-customer?s=w) is, what their pain points are and what’s the value of
your product for your target customers (based on the BIG problem you are
trying to solve). Basically, you’re getting answers to draft your [go-to-
market strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/go-to-market-
strategy-8-steps-for).

From 10 to 100 paying customers is the stage where you are trying to get your
[go-to-market strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/go-to-
market-strategy-8-steps-for) rolling, start automating the first steps, and
test different [acquisition
channels](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/12-powerful-b2b-saas-
channels-for?s=w).

During that stage, you will start to analyze your successful customers and
based on the learnings (what do our successful customers have in common)
iterate your ideal customer persona. You will also test out different [growth
channels](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-21-saas-gtm-channels) and learn
which ones are working, and which don’t.

Because of that, I would highly recommend you divide your launch into
different stages:

  * stage 1: from zero to 10 paying customers

  * stage 2: from 10 to 100 paying customers

  * stage 3: from 100 to 1000+ paying customers

Growing from 100 to 1000 paying customers is again a different stage. It's
mostly about execution, optimizing your strategies, and getting your KPIs and
metrics right (churn, LTV, CAC, and MRR).

[Steli Efti](https://blog.close.com/10-to-100-customers/) says that:

  * stage 1 is 90% short term tactics & 10% long term tactics

  * stage 2 is 80% short term tactics & 20% long term tactics

  * stage 3 is 20% short term tactics & 80% long term tactics

Winning your first 10 paying customers lets you gather the necessary
information to create the first version of a [powerful go-to-market
strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/go-to-market-
strategy-8-steps-for?s=w).

Follow those [8 tips to win your first 10 paying
customers](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/8-tips-how-to-get-your-
first-10-paid?s=w):

  1. Solve a real BIG problem

  2. Start with strategies that do NOT scale

  3. Be human and don’t sell your product in the first step

  4. Find customers, who love your product

  5. Avoid hard customers

  6. Qualify your customers - don't sell to every interested prospect

  7. Charge your first customers

  8. Ask for referrals

[Hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/gtm-strategy) defines a go-to-market
strategy (GTM) as “a step-by-step plan created to successfully launch a
product to market”. What it means is that your GTM strategy defines how you
literally connect your product with your potential customers.

Your go-to-market strategy covers the questions around...

  1. How do you communicate your value proposition to the market (brand messaging & [sales messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-framework))

  2. How do you sell the product to your [ICP](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile) and make them happy (product-led vs. sales-led)

  3. What [growth channels](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-21-saas-gtm-channels) & growth activities work best for your product

  4. How do you make money ([pricing strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-pricing-strategy))

...and is one of the 3 core elements of your [SaaS Growth
Strategy](https://www.notion.so/The-SaaS-Growth-Strategy-Guide-incl-Worksheet-
ce97ab50eb90403ca3d6465853103367).

Your powerful [Go-to-market
strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/go-to-market-
strategy-8-steps-for) makes sure that your growth activities (e.g. Facebook
Ads, Outbound Emails...) are efficient and show results.

strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/go-to-market-
strategy-8-steps-for?s=w)

Based on your product and the segment of the market you’re targeting, you need
to decide whether you follow a product-led growth (a self-service product) or
involve salespeople in your acquisition strategy. As it's really important, I
will highlight [product-led vs. sales-
led](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-saas-
growth?s=w) separately in this article.

The decision if you should follow a product-led growth vs. sales-led growth
vs. hybrid model (combination of both) is based on:

  * your [ICP](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile): how your customers actually want to buy your product (not what you personally prefer)

  * the complexity of your product // how easy can you deliver the value

  * the complexity and length of the buying process

  * your [pricing strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-pricing-strategy): the price point of your product (average contract value or MRR)

The more complex the product, the longer the sales cycle, and the more
expensive your product, the better is a sales-led strategy for you (and vice-
versa).

**Your ideal customer profile (ICP)**

Some types of customers prefer to have face-to-face contact (field sales) or
at least some personal human connection (e.g. online meetings), whereas others
prefer **to make their decisions without any contact with sales.** So it
depends also on the profile of customers and their personal preferences.
Normally the larger the accounts you’re hunting, the higher their preference
for field sales (and longer sales cycle).

**The pricing strategy (average contract value).**

If the average [price of your product](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-
ultimate-b2b-saas-pricing-guide) is (very) high, customers mostly take longer
to make a purchase decision (longer sales cycle). In this case, making use of
a salesperson can be a good idea. The higher the average contract value (ACV),
respectively your average monthly recurring revenue (MRR), the more I would
suggest a sales-driven growth.

A good benchmark for B2B SaaS is:

  1. **MRR < 100€** \- focus on product-led growth with self-service (you can't afford salespeople)

  2. **MRR < 1000€** \- focus on inside sales (no face-to-face meetings) - inbound and outbound sales

  3. **MRR > 3000€** (better 5000€) - focus on field sales (you probably can even afford field sales if they close more than 3 deals per month)

Of course, this is just a rough benchmark and is also depends on the average
sales cycle (how long it takes you to close a deal) and the number of deals
closed per month per sales rep.

**Complexity of product**

The more complex your product, the more often it requires the presence of a
salesperson to guide the customer. Customers tend to have more questions and
doubts about the value of your product, specific features, and challenges
along the way.

**How do you know if your chosen growth strategy is the right one for you?**

When you’re just starting and want to win your [first 10 paying
customers](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/8-tips-how-to-get-your-
first-10-paid?s=w), don’t care about what strategy you’re choosing. It’s all
about learning from your first 10 paying customers.

Growing from 10 to 100 paying customers is where you should start to test
different [channels](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-21-saas-gtm-channels)
and also track how healthy they are. A great indicator for you is the
**LTV/CAC ratio.** You should aim for 3 and above. It means the LTV (lifetime
value of your customer) is at least 3x higher than the costs for acquiring
your customer (CAC). This is a strong indicator that you're growing
sustainably and healthy. This ratio is becoming crucial for growing beyond 100
paying customers.

—> Check out [this site](https://www.geckoboard.com/best-practice/kpi-
examples/ltv-cac-ratio/) if you want to learn how to calculate both numbers.

When you follow a product-led self-service growth, your goal needs to be to
get new signups to the desired behavior (aha-moment) as fast as possible. This
means first of all that you need to know what’s the aha-moment of your product
(that’s when new users experience the value of your product).

Self-service is great for SaaS startups, if...

  * ... you can get your customers quickly to the **AHA moment** and...

  * ... your average contract value is below 100€ per month

  * ... your product has low complexity

Your product is considered as complex, if...

  * ... there are **high switching costs** , meaning it requires the whole organization to migrate from an existing solution to your product (especially with lots of historical data; example: CRM software, ERP software, Accounting software) or your software needs to be integrated into existing tools (and no API is available) or needs to be customized to the specific needs of the customers

  * ... there is a **high barrier** to getting started, e.g. your software only makes sense, if everyone in an organization is using it (it's rather untypical that customers implement your product to all employees _just for testing_ purposes) or a lot of specific know-how, training, and education is needed

As customers don't have any contact with sales, it's crucial for self-service
SaaS startups to focus a lot on their customers' onboarding experience. This
means you need to know the AHA moment of your product and tailor a powerful
onboarding experience around it.

The onboarding needs to be:

  * easy to understand (e.g. use product tours, academy videos, in-product messages, checklists & triggered emails...)

  * focused on delivering value to the user fast

  * divided into smaller actions to ensure fast achievements (e.g. progress bars, checklists...)

Make sure to track how your customers use the product (and send customized
communication) and the conversion to active and paying customers.

Sales-driven growth is the right strategy, if...

  * ... your pricing is at least above 100€ MRR or...

  * ... your product is rather complex (hard to get users to the aha moment without human touch)

  * ... your sales team can close lots (more than 15 per month) of smaller deals (100€/month) and do so creates virality (referral program + organic virality) = not a long-term strategy

Here are some hands-on tips for your sales strategy:

  * offer a sales demo and not a free trial

  * your goal is to get customers to talk to sales (and not try the product on their own)

  * your call to action within your sales message (e.g. outbound emails or landing page) should be a _free demo_ or _talk to sales_

  * include your value proposition on all pages (landing page, schedule free demo page, confirmation page, booking confirmation page...)

  * be quick on inbound follow-ups (preferably within the [first 5 minutes - The Five Minute Rule)](https://www.qualified.com/blog/the-5-minute-rule-for-lead-response-time)

  * know your sales process (lead qualification, meeting preparation, sales demo with a discovery phase, demo follow-up...)

The higher the average MRR per customer, the more sense it makes to have an
outbound sales team or even account executives/field sales reps that are
visiting your customers in person.

P.S. Let me know if I should write a separate article on hands-on tips for
your sales strategy.

How do you know what channels work for you? The short answer is testing!

channels](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-21-saas-gtm-channels) (with low
