In this blog article, we will cover the most important steps for SaaS founders
to win the first 10 paying customers. So in case you are an early-stage start-
up founder and face the challenge of how you can find and win your first
customer, this blog article is for you.

A common mistake I see over and over again is that founders develop a
product/solution for a problem that might exist (or might not exist). Don't
develop a product without understanding the real problem of your potential
customer. This means before you actually build a product, take your time to
talk to your potential customers, understand their specific problems, and
evaluate together with them a potential solution.

So instead of building a product and then trying to find a customer group who
is interested in such a product, start with a well-defined problem from a
specific [target customer](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-
customer-profile) and build a product/solution for them.

If you solve their problem, you create value for them, which means they are
your customers and are willing to pay for it. This means you found your first
customer!

Most start-up founders want to have scalable sales and marketing strategies in
place straight from day one. They love the idea of having a scalable customer
acquisition strategy (nice paid ads on Google, Instagram, or Facebook, plus a
nicely designed landing page followed by a self-service SaaS product) and hope
they don't need to talk to the customers, onboard them and do some time
consuming manual work. While this is the desired strategy later on and should
be the objective for start-ups who’ve found product-market fit and focus on
growth, I would highly recommend starting manual hand recruiting your first 10
customers by doing stuff that does NOT scale (e.g. Outbound Sales, phone
calls, emails, etc...).

Preferably you start with customers you already know personally or are within
your network. In case this is not working for you, I would suggest you start
manually outreaching your specific [target
customer](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile).

Here are some potential strategies for you:

  * Direct Messages via Linkedin, Facebook, Instagram (depending on your target customer)

  * Outbound Email (with some Email Sequences)

  * Outbound Phone Calls

  * Social Network Groups (e.g. Facebook Groups or LinkedIn Groups)

For all those methods it’s crucial to have a well-defined target customer
persona.

A lot of inexperienced founders or technical founders think they need to have
the ‘perfect’ sales pitch and just use a template to win the client. My
experience is the more natural and human you are in your cold outreach the
more successful you will be. Don’t use sales scripts, show up as a human and
personalize your message to each potential customer. Don’t sell your product
in the first step, rather spend time with the customer, ask questions,
understand their specific situation and challenges, and then (in case the
customer is qualified) try to sell your product and win the deal.

As described in the first paragraph, in an ideal scenario you've already done
interviews with potential customers before you've built the product. This
means, just following up with them and showing them the product. The chances
are high that they love it and want to be your first customer. Depending on
your product, it could also make sense to sign LOIs with those customers
before you start building the product (mostly relevant for B2B Enterprise
SaaS). You should aim to find first customers who really love your product and
see high value in it. Don’t make the mistake of onboarding hard customers or
just anyone who is interested but does not fit your [target
person](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile)a (more
Infos in the following sections). And don’t underestimate the extra motivation
boost you’ll get if your first customers love you and your product and give
you positive feedback.

If it's getting hard for you to win your first customers, this is a strong
indicator that you most probably do not really solve an existing problem for
your customers. This means going back to step 1 and starting iterating.

How to make sure that a prospect is a qualified customer?

Actually declining interested prospects can help you to focus on the right
customers. Oftentimes I see start-ups being super happy about every single
prospect interested in using their product. I would highly recommend
qualifying your prospects to make sure you only serve the right target group.
A good way to do this is to ask prospects 3-5 qualifying questions - depending
on their answers you can easily decide if those are the right fit or not.

A lot of times I see SaaS founders offering their software completely for free
as they hope to grow faster without [charging their
customers](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-b2b-saas-pricing-guide).
As this could be later on an effective sales/marketing strategy, I would
highly suggest charging your customers from day one. Otherwise, you do not
know if your customers really see value in your product and are willing to pay
later on for it.

My recommendation is: 'Charge your client in order to solve their problem' -
if they only want to use your product for free this is a strong indicator that
the problem is not big enough for them.

When you’ve closed your first customer, ask them for referrals. The chances
are high that they know other potential clients within their industry, who
face similar problems and would be the ideal customer for your product. It is
totally fine to do that, so don’t hesitate.
