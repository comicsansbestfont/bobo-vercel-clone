In today's article, we will cover the topic of how you can validate your
business idea BEFORE you start building your product and wasting lots of time
and money.

**Validating your business idea** means, determining if there is a (big
enough) need for your product in a specific market (your target customers), as
well as whether people are willing to pay to have that need met.

One of the most common and painful _mistakes_ you can make as an early-stage
founder is having a (great) idea and immediately spending all your time
building a product without validating the idea upfront. Validating your idea
brings the following advantages:

  * minimize your risk of building a product nobody needs or wants to buy

  * don't waste your time and money

  * predict the revenue potential f your business idea upfront

  * speeds up your delivery of a highly valuable product (later on)

Probably the truest and most reliable way to validate your business idea is
that people actually give you money. That's also the reason why lots of
startups build landing pages with checkout pages (payment gateways) and ask
customers to pay for their planned product - even if there is no product
available yet.

Here's a shortlist of validation strategies, starting with the easiest (which
also tend to be low-confidence) and moving to the hardest (high-confidence):

  * gather data based on market research (e.g. Search interests like Google trends, SWOT Analysis, Market Trends, Papers, Statistics, Reviews, Communities like Facebook Groups or Reddit,...)

  * market testing by talking to other people/stakeholders (e.g. interviews, surveys, polls,_._..)

  * get real market commitment (waitlists, sales, letter of intent, pre-orders/crowdfunding, beta-tester)

I can highly recommend the book _[The Mom Test](http://momtestbook.com/) by
[@robfitz](https://medium.com/@robfitz)_

The first step to validating your business idea is to write down the key
assumptions for your business.

An assumption is something that you believe about your customer, market, and
your product without any significant evidence.

A hypothesis is your personal _best guess_ about what you expect to happen in
a given experiment. It's important that you phrase your hypotheses in such a
way, that you run the experiment, measure the result/metric, and take a
conclusion (verified or rejected). A useful hypothesis is a testable
statement.

Preferably your hypotheses follow a _cause and effect_ structure with a
measurable goal, e.g. _'If I write weekly valuable content for my subscribers,
30% of them will share the content with others.'_

> _**By the way 😜 : If you like the content, share it with your friends and
> help me to achieve my goal of 3000 subscribers.**_

Those core assumptions about your business help you to come up with hypotheses
that you are going to test and verify in the next steps.

I would limit the number of core hypotheses to a maximum of 25. Otherwise, you
are losing the overview.

To know where to start testing your hypotheses, I would highly recommend
defining for each of your hypotheses 2 metrics:

Multiply both metrics, you will have your _**hypothesis score**._ Now, rank
the hypotheses based on their individual _**hypothesis score**_. Focus your
energies on what really matters and validate the important hypotheses first.

After you've phrased your core hypotheses, spend some time researching the
market and your potential opportunity. Find answers to the following
questions:

  * How big is the market?

  * Is the market growing?

  * What is the growth rate of this market?

  * How many relevant competitors are in this market?

  * How many people are searching for your product or the problem you are trying to solve?

  * How much money do people spend on average on your product?

  * Are there any significant user behavior changes/trends for your business (e.g. online payment share, vegetarians, online advertisement spend...)?

Based on your research, do the first calculation on the market size and your
revenue potential. Here is a theoretical example: You want to serve vegetarian
restaurants with a new software product, I would do the following quick
calculation:

  * 11 million restaurants in Europe

  * share of vegetarian restaurants is 3%, assuming to grow to 8% in the next 10 years

  * this means a TAM of 880k vegetarian restaurants

  * planned SaaS price of 100€/month means a **TAM of 88 million € per month**

  * potential to win a market share of 10% of the TAM, which means **8.8 million € per month revenue potential**

To avoid the mistake of building a product no one needs, talk early to your
customers. For me, this step is probably the most important step in your
validation.

Spend enough time with your customers and really understand their challenges,
problems, and needs. If you find out about their **biggest problems** (pain
points) and you are building a product or service that solves their biggest
problems, you can almost be sure they are willing to pay for it.

Great questions to ask potential customers include:

  * What are the 3 most annoying/biggest problems for you in terms of...(fill in the product category, the market you are after)?

  * How are you currently trying to solve…(Fill in the problem)?

  * What’s the most annoying thing about the...(Fill in the problem you are trying to solve)?

  * Why didn’t you already change it? What's holding you back to solve the problem?

  * How would the ideal world be for you?

  * I am working on...(Fill in your solution)- Would that be valuable to you? Why? Why not?

Make sure you first understand your customer's needs and motivation before
talking about your idea. Don't try to lead the conversation to your solution.
This will help you get the most out of customer interviews.

Now it's time to do quick experiments and test your hypotheses. Depending on
the types of hypotheses you can use different ways to validate your
hypotheses. Use the [hypotheses validation
framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V1YnI-
akrBvVp4cOjbfW1PSxPycLmeJqBcTzlRxgVwA/edit#gid=0) to run your own experiments.

Always think about ways how you can test the hypotheses **really fast and
cheaply** (without spending time and money on actually building the product).

**Popular types of MVPs are:**

This means instead of actually building the product, you offer your
manpower/human resources to solve your customers' needs. E.g. if you are
building marketing software to automatically optimize Facebook ads, you can
start to do Facebook ads optimization as a service.

This approach allows you to test your idea without developing any product.

You can create a landing page describing your planned product and the problem
you are trying to solve. Landing pages are great to test your hypotheses
against user expectations and interests. Offer visitors a call to action which
helps you to measure your idea, popular CTAs are:

  * email sign-ups

  * waitlist sign-ups

  * actual checkout/payments

  * schedule demos

If you are building a physical product, test and evaluate your potential
solution by building a low fidelity physical prototype for customers to
interact with.

Talk to your customers in person and test their interest and willingness to
pre-order. Also great in combination with a landing page.

Another strategy is to test the interest of potential customers using
crowdfunding platforms or platforms like https://www.producthunt.com/ to
promote your business idea. This strategy needs to be combined with one of the
MVP types above.

I really like this image on how to build a minimum viable product (MVP).

I can highly recommend checking out Dan Federiko's article on [How to build an
MVP](https://medium.com/elligense-team/how-to-build-mvp-step-by-step-
guide-d931f78cb53f).

Make sure you always measure the performance of your MVPs (and experiments).
Define up front what a successful MVP looks like (success metric) for you and
write it down. For instance, a successful MVP could be defined as follows:

  * a waitlist of #100 B2B customers

  * pre-orders of #1000 units

  * 20% of all interviewed companies signed a letter of intent

  * a conversion rate of 5% for visitors to sign up

If you have proven your hypotheses and gained (enough) confidence in your
business idea, it's finally time for you to build your amazing product.
