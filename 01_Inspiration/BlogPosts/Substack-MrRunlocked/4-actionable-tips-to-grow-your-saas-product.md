You have lots of traffic, but low sign-up conversion rates?

A [powerful](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-homepage-copywriting-guide)
above-the-fold section is key for high conversions.

Visitors immediately need to know how your product helps them.

And the top section (called the above-the-fold section) receives the most
attention from your visitors because it's the first thing they see before
scrolling down.

This section needs to grab the attention of the visitor - otherwise, you will
lose them!

**Revamp the top section of your website so it answers the two main
questions:👇**

  1. How does your product help the visitor? (Main Benefit, Main Job to be done)

  2. What is it that you are selling?

guide](https://marketingexamples.com/landing-page/guide) on powerful landing
pages that convert by [Harry

**For the rest of your website, also make sure:**

**✔️ Your headlines of each section matter**

80% only read headlines. If you only read your headlines, do they tell a
powerful story? Read out loud! If not, revamp your headlines.

**✔️ Your headlines are short and value-focused**

Ideally, your headlines are 6-word headlines. Include power words. Talk about
the values and benefits.

**✔️ Your headlines include power words and adjectives**

Power words include words like ‘risk-free’, ‘trusted’, ‘cancel anytime’,
‘now’, ‘today’, ‘join’, ‘increase’, ‘decrease’, ‘try’, ‘discover’, ‘start’,
‘earn’, ‘grow’, ‘satisfied’, ‘happy’, ‘improved’, ‘effective’, etc.

**✔️ Write in a conversational tone**

It’s about you and them. Use ‘you’. Write like you are talking to a specific
prospect. Use active sentences instead of passive sentences. Maybe even add
questions to engage with them.

**✔️ Easy to understand language**

Use the language of your customers. Keep sentences short. Get rid of
complicated words.

**Exercise for you:**

Review your website and check, if the following questions (your visitors will
have) are answered:

👍 What is the Call-to-action for me?

👍 What is the product? (easy to understand, 1-sentence description)

👍 Is this product the right one for me?

👍 Who else is using it? (social proof, testimonials, building trust)

👍 How much is it? What's the price and what’s the value for me?

👍 What can I do if I need help or have more questions? (Helpcenter, Talk to
Sales or Support, FAQ, etc.)

Case studies are great social proof & help close more deals 🎉

But you’ve never created one or don’t know how to create one? 🤷‍♂️

Copy the template and create your own powerful case study. 👇

Case studies help you to convert more signups to customers.

Case studies can be used as lead magnets, but especially it’s beneficial to
share in your welcome email sequence (for new sign-ups) as well as
after/during sales calls.

Basically, it’s about sharing how ‘peers’ (companies that are similar to the
prospect), who had the same pain point, became successful/happy using your
product.

So, if you want to create a case study that really converts, follow these 5
elements:

**1️⃣ State the problem (of the customer)**

Give background information about the customers and the situation (—> so
prospects can relate to them).

Highlight the challenge they faced.

Explain why they considered your product.

**2️⃣ Solution part**

Focus on how your product helped them to solve the problem.

If it makes sense, go into detail (if this increases the trustworthiness of
your product).

Always restate the main 2-3 benefits (your value proposition).

**3️⃣ Results**

How did your product impact the situation of your customer for the better?

What are the functional, emotional & social results for them?

How did you influence the jobs to be done for your customer?

**4️⃣ Make it personal**

Add one or more customer quotes.

Add the name & role of your customer (this increases the credibility).

Images or better videos make it super personal.

Let them speak to the camera and create a video testimonial.

**5️⃣ Strong CTA**

Don’t forget to add a clear ‘next step’.

If your prospects want to become successful, let them know what they need to
do.

If you follow a [sales-led

Don't do what most salespeople do when they start in Sales. ❌

Most want to sound 'perfect' and super professional.

They write a perfect call script. Learn it by heart. Repeat it 100x times.

Unfortunately, you will sound like a robot. Your customer will notice it.

They don't like it and don't trust you.

A simple hack that improved my cold calls.

Speak the same language as the prospect.

You will build trust by being authentic. So don't use your voice to sound
'perfect'. Instead, use conversational language and speak like you normally
speak. Be human.

Questions](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexander-estner_b2bsales-

and close more deals.

I’m pretty sure you know the moment your prospect tells you, that your product
is too expensive.

Prospect: "You are too expensive!"

Unexperienced founders or sales person will reply:

You: “Okay, I can offer you a 50% discount” 🤑

Don’t do that! ❌

Don’t just offer a discount, because you will lower the value of your product.

Instead, follow the following 2 steps.

**Step 1: Challenge their perspective.**

Ask them: "Too expensive? Compared to what?”

Some prospects just want to test the limits and challenge your pricing. So
don’t get discouraged and give up on the deal. Also, don’t start to argue why
you are ‘so expensive’. There is no need to defend your
[pricing](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-b2b-saas-pricing-guide).

So instead, ask questions. Why do you think we are expensive? Compared to
what?

Your goal is to find out their true objection.

If it’s really about the price, they haven’t understood the value of your
product. There are 2 reasons for that. Either you haven’t done a proper
discovery and didn’t find the specific pain point of the prospect OR your
sales pitch wasn’t good so they didn’t understand how your product solves
their problem (= don’t see the value).

This means you must go back and do a new discovery/ better solution
presentation.

**Step 2: Quid pro quo**

When offering a discount, always ask for something in return.

👉 “I can offer you a 15% discount for the first year in exchange for a video
testimonial.”👈

Otherwise, you devalue your product and lose trust.

I can highly recommend you create a framework for your discount policy. It’s
clear who gets a discount in exchange for what and when. This is especially
important once your sales, marketing, and customer success teams are growing.

Here are **5 examples of discount policies** :

1️⃣ Long term commitment (e.g. 3-year contract)

2️⃣ Upfront annual payments (e.g. yearly payment instead of monthly; 10-20%
discount compared to monthly payment —> ‘2-month for free’)

3️⃣ Taking part in a case study (e.g. creating a video testimonial)

4️⃣ Intros/referrals to other companies (e.g. for every successful referral,
you will get 2 months for free)

5️⃣ Signing/onboarding in the next x days (e.g. No set-up fee, if you migrate
till the end of the month)

Lots of fun and success with your business 🚀.
