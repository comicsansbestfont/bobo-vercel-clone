 _Want to reach 3200+ early-stage SaaS founders/leaders?_

One of the critical decisions you'll face is selecting the right go-to-market
(GTM) tech stack to drive your initial growth.

This article will focus on building an outbound-led GTM tech stack for early-
stage SaaS startups.

Outbound-led strategies are prevalent among early-stage SaaS startups for two
primary reasons:

  1. **Historical Success and Expertise:** Outbound sales have been a cornerstone of business development for decades, resulting in a rich pool of expertise and proven methodologies.

  2. **Speed and Simplicity:** Outbound strategies can be quickly implemented and offer rapid results. This is crucial when you’re in the ideation stage and striving to achieve problem-market fit. You need to determine if customers are willing to pay for your solution.

You likely don’t have a clear [ideal customer profile
(ICP](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile)), target
persona, segmentation, or well-defined [value
proposition](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/simple-value-proposition-canvas)
and [messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-
framework) in the early stages. Outbound sales allow you to cast a wide net,
gather immediate feedback, and iterate quickly.

With so many tools available, choosing the right ones for your GTM strategy
can be overwhelming. Different goals, scenarios, skill sets, countries,
industries, and GTM motions make a one-size-fits-all solution impossible. This
guide will help you navigate these complexities and build an effective,
tailored tech stack.

  1. **Own the Process:** You must have control and a thorough understanding of your sales process.

  2. **Avoid Overengineering:** Keep your tech stack simple and focused.

  3. **Easy to Implement:** Choose tools that are straightforward to set up.

  4. **Be Cost-Conscious:** Even with ample funding, avoid unnecessary expenditures. Build a functional system first, then scale.

  5. **User-Friendly:** Ensure your tools are easy to use.

  6. **Measurable:** Implement tools that provide clear metrics and insights.

Going from 0€ to 1€ million ARR, you must manage numerous interactions and
leads.

Here’s a breakdown of 10 mandatory and nice-to-have tools (+ 1 bonus tool):

Find the contacts/companies that match your [Ideal Customer
Profile](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile).

Get in touch with your ICP contacts and share your
[messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-
framework).

Keep track of your customer relationships.

Enrich your contacts with relevant information (phone number, email, etc.)

Scrape (contact) data (e.g. LinkedIn commenters).

Add cold calls to your GTM motion.

Record your sales meetings and take notes. Add insights to your CRM.

Identify your website visitors (high-intent leads)

Know the best time to reach out to your contacts. Identify (high intent)
[trigger events](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-perfect-cold-email-tapsa-
framework).

Don’t become blocked by Google and co., and don't end up in Spam.

New product category. Let’s you build lookalike target lists based on your
customers.

The initial setup phase is intended for early-stage startups that are just
starting their outreach efforts.

This phase is crucial for determining the most effective [customer profile
segments](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile),
[messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-
framework), and channels ([LinkedIn](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/linkedin-
prospecting-sequencing) and [email](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-perfect-
cold-email-tapsa-framework) are recommended starting points).

Understanding how your audience interacts with your messaging across
[different channels](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/12-powerful-b2b-saas-
channels-for) is vital.

During this phase, you will run numerous small campaigns and multivariate
tests to gather data and insights.

👉 Track your Outbound Campaigns

Since this is not mass outreach, you don't need to worry too much about domain
rotation or other mass outreach regulations.

However, we recommend implementing a personalized touchpoint approach based on
your contact search filters (e.g., "I've seen you grew in department X by more
than Y%..."). Get creative at this stage.

👉 [Trigger-based outreach](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-perfect-cold-
email-tapsa-framework) is your friend.

**Step 1.1: Define Your Initial Customer Profile**

  * **Action:** Identify your [initial customer profile](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile) and break it down into sub-profiles.

  * **Example:** For GTM Pioneers, the initial profile might be people in Europe interested in learning about GTM and shaping its future. Sub-profiles could include founders in Germany, Spain, etc., and sales leaders in these countries.

  * **Why:** With an Initial Customer Profile Breakdown, can you test different messages and different Target Audiences to learn what works best

  * **Tip:** Create detailed sub-profiles using demographic, geographic, and firmographic criteria.

this example, we created a list of 34 different Initial Customer Profile
Cohorts. These cohorts are differentiated by location, title/role, and
language. The keywords are always the same and are chosen to ensure a higher
level of intent, as they are relevant to the exact field we serve._

**Step 1.2: Set Up a CRM System**

👉 How to synch [Lemlist with
Hubspot](https://help.lemlist.com/en/articles/4452798-hubspot-integration-
importing-leads-from-hubspot-to-lemlist) or [Lemlist with
Pipedrive](https://help.lemlist.com/en/articles/5291961-lemlist-first-sync-
pipedrive-with-lemlist).

**Step 1.3: Gather Initial Contacts**

  * **Action:** Sign up for LinkedIn Sales Navigator or [Apollo.io](https://apollo.grsm.io/alexestner).

  * **Why:** These tools will help you quickly gather a list of potential leads.

  * **Tip:** Export as many relevant contacts as possible during the trial period (e.g. using [evaboot](https://evaboot.com/)) to maximize value. LinkedIn Sales Navigator allows you to add up to 25 leads to a list in bulk. Create small lists for initial testing, but aim to gather as many contacts as possible during the trial. Tools like Evaboot can help maximize contact extraction.

_!The following steps are just an example. You can also
use[Apollo.io](https://apollo.grsm.io/alexestner) to search for contacts and
[kaspr.io](http://kaspr.io) to download contacts!_

_Step 1.3.1._ Create your search:

_Step 1.3.2._ Safe your search:

_Step 1.3.3._ Build lists:

_Step 1.3.4._ Download contacts with [Evaboot](https://evaboot.com/):

👉 If you’re new to LinkedIn Sales Navigator, check out this awesome guide on
[how to use LinkedIn sales navigator](https://evaboot.com/blog/how-to-use-
linkedin-sales-navigator).

**Step 1.4: Implement a Multichannel Outreach Tool**

  * **Action:** Choose and set up an outreach tool like [Lemlist.com](https://get.lemlist.com/vetted-tools) or [LaGrowthMachine.com](http://LaGrowthMachine.com)

  * **Why:** These tools allow you to manage email and LinkedIn outreach in one place.

  * **Tip:** Start with a small outreach campaign (about 100 contacts) to test and refine your messaging.

_1.4.1._ Connect your identity

 _1.4.2._ Create first campaigns (use the templates from LaGrowthMachine)

_1.4.3._ Choose the Channels and Templates you want to use (Start with
LinkedIn or when you want to start directly with LinkedIn and mail use this
template).

_!Audio performs very well on LinkedIn_

 _1.4.4._ Upload your contact list or paste the URL of your LinkedIn Sales
Navigator Search

 _1.4.5._ Create a campaign for each Initial Customer Profile Segment

 _1.4.6._ Setup DNS Setting ()

👉 Read [this](https://dmarcly.com/blog/spf-dkim-dmarc-set-up-guide-for-g-
suite-gmail-for-business) article on DNS setup.

_1.4.7._ Run your campaigns. Numbers you should achieve:

  * 30% Acceptance Rate (on LinkedIn)

  * 50% Email open rate

  * <5% Email bounce rate

  * 10% response rate (LinkedIn and Email)

  * 3-5% interest rate/ positive responses

**Step 1.5: Integrate a VoIP Tool**

  * **Action:** Set up a VoIP tool like Phoneburner.

  * **Why:** VoIP tools streamline your calling process and keep records of your communications.

  * **Tip:** Use the tool’s analytics to refine your calling strategy.

**Step 1.6: Utilize a Notetaker Tool**

  * **Action:** Implement a notetaker tool like [Fireflies.ai](http://Fireflies.ai).

  * **Why:** Automatic note-taking saves time and ensures you capture important details from calls.

  * **Tip:** Review and categorize notes regularly to identify common themes and insights.

_Step 1.6.1._ You can integrate notetaker tools, VoIP solutions, and
Multichannel Outreach Tools easily as you can see here:

In Phase 2, you should build on the data patterns identified in Phase 1 to
create a primary ideal customer profile and develop effective messaging.

The goal is to expand your outreach efforts to determine if they are
sustainable and scalable.

Enhancing data quality and personalizing outreach are key. This involves
obtaining email addresses, even if tools like
[Lemlist.com](https://get.lemlist.com/vetted-tools) or
[LaGrowthMachine.com](http://LaGrowthMachine.com) can't find a professional
email address on the LinkedIn profile (data enrichment).

Personalized outreach using scraped information and timing your outreach based
on [triggers](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-perfect-cold-email-tapsa-
framework) is crucial.

While a tool like [Clay](https://clay.com/?via=79220e) can handle these tasks,
it may be too complex for inexperienced users.

Therefore, you can use different tools for each use case:

**Step 2.1: Integrate Scraping Tools**

  * **Action:** Set up scraping tools like Bardeen or IDS (Instant Data Scraper).

  * **Why:** These tools help build target account lists and personalize your outreach.

  * **Tip:** Use these tools to refine your contact lists based on specific criteria.

_!This example demonstrates how to create an account list using a scraper.
This list can help you find the right contacts for your target accounts, as
outlined in Phase 1. If you want to automate this process, consider
using[Clay](https://clay.com/?via=79220e). However, automation is more
appropriate for Phase 3, when transitioning from early-stage to growth-stage.
You can also use this scraping method to compile contact lists from various
web pages.!_

_Step 2.1.1._ Search for results on a page you like to generate contacts or
accounts from (in my example, companies that hire in the go-to-market space)

_Step 2.1.2._ Open your scraper (in my example Instant Data Scraper, but you
can use others like [bardeen.ai](http://bardeen.ai) or
[phantombuster.com](https://phantombuster.com?deal=alex40) as well)

_Step 2.1.3._ Download your list as CSV

 _Step 2.1.4._ Now you can create more personalized messaging for these
scraped target accounts and the contacts you’ve found, such as "I just saw
your job listing for XYZ on Indeed…".

**Step 2: Implement Trigger Tools**

  * **Action:** Use tools like Trigify to time your outreach.

  * **Why:** Timing your outreach based on triggers (e.g., job changes, funding rounds) increases response rates.

  * **Tip:** Set up alerts for key triggers relevant to your industry.

_!As Trigify is in Beta, we can’t share Screenshots yet!_

_Step 2.2.1._ Define your triggers (Here are some examples)

_Step 2.2.2._ Upload your contact lists

 _Step 2.2.3._ Define your trigger workflow in Trigify

**Alternative Step 2: Intent as a trigger**

 _Step 2.2.1a._ Create ICP list in [Ocean.io](http://Ocean.io) (In our example
we would look for StartUps with less than 50 employees in Germany and look for
their founders and CROs)

_Step 2.2.2a._ Create Intent Keywords (In my example: Growth, Sales and
Revenue related)

The list of Intent topics I have chosen in [Ocean.io](http://Ocean.io)

 _Step 2.2.3a._ Connect Intent and List

Connect your Intent topics with your ICP lists in [Ocean.io](http://Ocean.io)

**Step 3: Enrich Your Data**

  * **Action:** Use enrichment tools like [Prospeo.io](http://Prospeo.io) or [Bettercontact.rocks](https://bettercontact.rocks?fpr=gtm-pioneers).

  * **Why:** Enriched data provides deeper insights into your leads, improving personalization.

  * **Tip:** Regularly update and clean your data to maintain its accuracy.

_Step 2.3.1._ Start finding the contact data of your target ICPs

 _Step 2.3.2._ Upload your contact list (like the one you’ve downloaded with
[evaboot](https://evaboot.com/))

_Step 2.3.3._ Start Waterfall Enrichment over all tools you want to check

When you're ready to expand your outreach efforts and you're still getting
reasonable response rates from phase 2, and you have a large target market,
it's time to consider account-based enrichment.

Enrichment tools such as BetterContact are not enough at this stage. You need
to enrich data at the account level to find suitable contacts and then enrich
their contact data further.

[Clay](https://clay.com/?via=79220e) is a comprehensive tool that can handle
all these enrichment tasks in one place. If [Clay](https://www.clay.com/)
seems too complicated, consider hiring an agency.

You can also follow a setup similar to the one in the image below.

Your enrichment and outreach infrastructure becomes more complex at this
stage. To avoid being blocked by email providers like Google or Yahoo, you
need to implement domain rotation, email warm-up, and other best practices for
mass outreach.

Consider separating LinkedIn and email outreach when scaling your cold
outreach efforts. Although it's not mandatory, better results can be achieved
by using tools that are solely focused on one outreach channel rather than a
single tool for all channels.

While using a multichannel approach may save time, the best results are
generated at scale by using different engagement tools for different channels.
You can connect the channels in your list building through logic, for example,
by putting a contact in a list for LinkedIn outreach if the person hasn't
responded via email yet.

For LinkedIn, you can continue using LaGrowthMachine or
[HeyReach.io](http://HeyReach.io)

Other alternatives include [Expandi.io](https://expandi.io/?red=alexanbeecd1)
and Dripify.

[Smartlead.ai,](http://smartlead.ai/)
[Lemlist.com](https://get.lemlist.com/vetted-tools), and
[Woodpecker.co](https://app.woodpecker.co/promo/EPp3FUSjMj) are great options
for email outreach.

Make sure you have the proper infrastructure in place with tools like
[Mailforge](https://www.mailforge.ai/) or
[Maildoso](http://maildoso.com/?ref=GTM-Pioneers). Some tools, like
[Lemlist.com](https://get.lemlist.com/vetted-tools), already have an
integrated infrastructure feature.

**Step 3.1.: Contact Data Generation**

  * **Action:** Utilize RB2B for web visitor data, Sales Navigator or [Apollo.io](https://apollo.grsm.io/alexestner) for contact data, and Bardeen for personalization.

  * **Why:** Combining data sources ensures comprehensive and accurate contact information.

  * **Tip:** Cross-reference data from multiple sources to verify accuracy.

**Step 3.2.: Connect Different Tools and Data Sources**

  * **Action:** Use [Zapier.com](http://Zapier.com) or [Make.com](http://Make.com) to connect your tools.

  * **Why:** Integrating tools through automation platforms streamlines workflows and data sharing. Most tools have direct connections but sometimes you need an extra connection between your data sources, channels, and tools.

  * **Tip:** Set up automated workflows for common tasks like lead nurturing and follow-ups.

**Step 3.3.: Enhance Outreach Strategies**

  * **Action:** Implement email tools like Instantly or Smartleads and LinkedIn outreach tools like Expandi or Heyreach.

  * **Why:** Diversifying outreach channels increases your reach and engagement.

  * **Tip:** Use A/B testing to refine messaging and determine the most effective outreach strategies.

**Step 3.4.: Implement Education and Enablement Tools**

  * **Action:** Integrate tools like [Grw.ai](http://Grw.ai) for ongoing training and development.

  * **Why:** Continuous learning and development keep your team sharp and adaptable.

  * **Tip:** Schedule regular training sessions and monitor progress through analytics.

  1. **Overengineering the Tech Stack:** Start simple and avoid unnecessary complexity.

  2. **Overspending on Tools:** Be mindful of costs and only invest in essential tools initially.

  3. **Neglecting Training:** Ensure your team understands how to use the tools effectively.

  4. **Lack of Iteration:** Continuously refine your approach based on feedback and results.

Building the right outbound GTM tech stack for your early-stage SaaS startup
is crucial for achieving your growth goals.

Start with a simple, cost-effective, efficient setup, then iterate and expand
based on your initial successes.

Note: Many other great tools are available for your outreach setup, but we’ve
focused on a few to avoid overwhelming you. Remember, the key is to build a
tech stack that supports rapid iteration and feedback, allowing you to refine
your approach as you grow. Good luck, and happy selling✌🏽!

Happy growth 🚀
