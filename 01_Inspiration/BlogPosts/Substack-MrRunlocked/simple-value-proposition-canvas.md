For most of us, communicating the value of our product is difficult.

I see 2 types of people:

1️⃣ **’in-depth’ peopl** e

> —> They tend to explain their product in detail. But missing the bigger
> picture. They usually forget to talk about the IDEAL CUSTOMER and their
> PROBLEMS.

2️⃣ **’unspecific’ people**

> —> They tend to stay high-level and generic. People don’t get what their
> product does. They touch IDEAL CUSTOMER and PROBLEMS on the surface but
> usually neglect how their SOLUTION works.

If you belong to one of the 2 types of people, I have a solution for you.

Estner: The simple Value Proposition Canvas

**The template covers 7 key elements:**

  1. Persona / Target Audience

  2. Usecase

  3. Current way of doing the 'usecase’

  4. Limitation of 'current way'

  5. Resulting 'pain point'

  6. The better way: your product capabilities

  7. Resulting Benefits

This simple Value Proposition Canvas will help you level up your customer-
facing communication.

This means, adapting the messaging for:

  1. Your Website (—> Check out my [Ultimate SaaS Homepage Template](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-perfect-homepage-for-early-stage-saas))

[SaaS Messaging Framework](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-
messaging-framework)

More and more SaaS founders use LinkedIn as their main inbound channel.

Trying hard to build an audience online.

Thought Leadership content is a hot topic in 2024.

While it’s easy to get lost in vanity metrics like comments and likes, it’s
way more important to optimize how to get qualified leads.

Because what most SaaS founders want are inbound leads.

Leads that belong to their [ideal customer
profile](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile).

So they can convert them to pipeline.

However, lots of founders find it hard to create content on LinkedIn.

They face 2 core challenges:

—> That’s why I created a framework on how to turn [1 topic into 250+ LinkedIn
posts](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/7-step-content-framework).

And don’t make the mistake of starting with TOFU content.

Instead, focus on BOFU-related content.

Here are a few interesting links about BOFU content:

There are a few things that are important for a good post:

👉 Engaging Hook (so people read your post)

👉 Easy to read/scan (clean format)

👉 Copywriting (short sentences)

👉 CTA (for engagement or to take action)

To make it easier for you to get started, I worked on LinkedIn templates for
you.

Don’t run blind in your outbound campaigns.

Test the different variables to know what works and what does not.

Running outbound campaigns involves constant testing and experiments.

Outbound campaigns are more than just 1 cold email.

If you want to learn what works and what doesn't, you need to experiment a
lot.

Designing a campaign is not trivial.

Tip: Only change 1 variable at a time.

Here are 5 variables when testing outbound 👇

1️⃣ Persona

2️⃣ Company Type

  * size of company

  * industry, etc.

3️⃣ Problem statement / usecase

4️⃣ Messaging

5️⃣ Campaign design

Of course, in each of 5 variables, there are multiple sub-variables to play
around and test.

These can include:

🔸 Subject Lines

🔸 CTAs

🔸 Offers/Content

🔸 Leads

But especially pre-PMF it's about testing the main 5 variables.
