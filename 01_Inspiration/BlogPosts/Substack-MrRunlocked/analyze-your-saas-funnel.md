2 weeks ago we covered [reverse engineering your sales
funnel](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/reverse-engineering-template-saas).

That way you know what you need to achieve every week, month, and quarter.

Your funnel will look more or less like this:

1️⃣ Website Traffic

2️⃣ Signups

3️⃣ Demos / Trials

4️⃣ Won

5️⃣ Churn

Yours will be slightly different.

Depending on if you’re sales-led or product-led. But that’s not the point.

But if you’re not hitting your goals. How do you know what’s working and more
importantly what’s not?

That’s when you need to analyze your funnel.

Do you have a:

❌ Acquisition problem?

❌ Conversion problem?

❌ Activation problem?

❌ Retention problem?

Here’s a quick checklist to analyze your funnel and identify your problems.

If you don’t get any relevant traffic on your website and also see a low
response rate on your outbound campaigns, then your problem might be:

**❌ Messaging problem**

—> People don’t respond to your outbound campaign. Your messaging isn’t
resonating. Most probably they don’t understand/feel the problem you are
trying to solve for them.

Framework](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-
framework)

**❌ Channel problem**

—> Might be that the messaging is not the problem, but you’re not where your
ideal customers hang around.

[100+ SaaS Growth Tactics](https://alexestner.gumroad.com/l/database-growth-
strategies-saas)

**❌ Not solving a problem?**

—> Might also be true that you’re on the wrong way and there is no market for
your product. Are you sure you’re solving a real problem? So you’re a true
pain killer and not just a nice-to-have vitamin?

**❌ Messaging/ value proposition problem**

—> Your website messaging is the problem. Not clear what problem you’re
solving and how you’re solving it. No reason/urgency to click the CTA.

saas) \+ [The Ultimate SaaS Messaging
Framework](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-
framework)

**❌ Positioning problem**

—> People don’t get what you’re doing and how you’re different than other
solutions in the market. Important positioning elements are: Target audience,
usecase(s) and product category.

positioning](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-positioning-6-different-ways)
& [3 types of competition](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/3-types-of-
competition)

**❌ Homepage design & structure**

—> It can also be the case that your messaging itself is not the problem, but
your website is just not good. Competition is huge and if you don’t grab the
attention of visitors in the first 10 seconds, you’re lost. They scan your
website, so make sure you have all the relevant sections of a powerful
homepage & your headlines are on point.

Homepage](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-perfect-homepage-for-early-stage-
saas)

**❌ Sales Demo problem**

—> A lot of times demos are 1-way presentations of features. That’s not how
you will win prospects. Instead powerful demos follow a [9-step demo
process](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-sales-product-
demos).

common-gtm-myths) & [Sales Discovery
Cheatsheet](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/sales-qualification-discovery-calls)

**❌ Sales Process**

—> Another common mistake. You don’t have a clear sales process. So you can’t
guide prospects from the first touchpoint to signing the contract (and
onboarding). And most common is that the sales process is broken after demos.

📚 Helpful resources: [Mutual Action
Plans](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/mutual-action-plans-and-the-power-of-
pain-points)

**❌ Sales Messaging**

—> The way you present your product is _feature fucking_. You can’t explain
why your product is important, what it does, what they get using it and how
you’re different than the competition.

Messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-
framework) & [The 1-sentence value
proposition](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/simple-value-proposition-canvas)

**❌ Onboarding problem**

—> You make it too hard for users to reach the aha moment of your product. So
they never experience the value of your product and ultimately don’t convert
to paying customers.

leads](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/role-of-customer-success-and-5-sales-

tips](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/13-powerful-tips-on-activating-more) & [8
free trial fundamentals](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/free-trials-
fundamentals)

**❌ Pricing**

—> Or the problem is not onboarding, but your pricing. The relationship
between the value of the product and the price you charge is not in balance.
But the pricing is more than the pure € you charge. It’s about the right value
metric, packaging, and payment terms.

📚 Helpful resources: [The Ultimate SaaS Pricing
Guide](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-b2b-saas-pricing-guide)

**❌ Onboarding problem**

—> It’s important that your sales process doesn’t stop with ‘contract signed’.
Customer Success is responsible for getting all new customers to ‘active’, to
reduce the risk of potential churn.

success-and-5-sales-reports)

**❌ Product problem (no product-market fit)**

—> Customers realize that your product is not solving their problem. The
product is not delivering what you promised them in your marketing. Without
product-market fit, you’re not ready to scale.

is an easy yet powerful tactic to improve conversion.

The same is true if your main CTA is to book a demo.
