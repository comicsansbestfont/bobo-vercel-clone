The annual life review was a game-changer for me.

Reviewing the past year and planning the year ahead are part of my life since
2019. Always between Christmas and the first week of January, I take some days
off and create my life review.

It empowers me to:

  * reflect on the high and low lights of the year.

  * set clear directions for the upcoming year

  * set priorities for the year.

  * decide on things I want to get rid of

  * create new habits.

At the end of the day, it makes it easier for me to reflect on my life.

Together with the daily 6-minutes journaling book (3 minutes every morning + 3
minutes every evening), it's a very powerful tool for me.

Here's the template I use for it. 👇

As a SaaS startup, you always want to increase your revenue. But increasing
revenue is not only limited to adding new customers.

> Growing revenue ≠ Winning new customers

Increasing the ARPA (average revenue per account) is another very effective
method. Especially once you are adding consistently new customers and want to
scale your business, working on your ARPA can be very effective.

Work on your [pricing](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-b2b-saas-
pricing-guide) to increase the ARPA.

This includes:

  * increasing prices,

  * Nudging customers to higher tiers

  * switching to a scalable value metric (instead of a flat fee or feature-based pricing)

  * restructuring your pricing plans (e.g. different packaging of included features)

Focus on upselling and cross-selling activities to increase the ARPA of your
existing customers.

This includes:

  * Working on an upselling strategy (Who, when, how & what [messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-framework) to upsell)

  * increase product engagement in combination with a usage-based value metric (so you charge the customers more as they use the product more heavily)

  * cross-selling of complimentary services (knowing which customers need what kind of additional services)

Reducing your churn rate and keeping customers longer will positively affect
your LTV (customer lifetime value). So you make more revenue with your
customers over time.

With a higher LTV, you can also invest more money in acquisition without
hurting your LTV to CAC ratio

This includes:

  * Identify early churn candidates with churn alerts (and proactively offer solutions to keep them engaged)

  * Reminding paying customers about the value of your product (powerful product marketing with [messaging around value proposition](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-framework))

  * Account/Customer Success Manager (to work with top tier accounts)

👉 Here’s a [deep dive into each of the 3 ways to increase your
ARPA](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/3-ways-to-increase-your-
average-revenue)

If you follow a [sales-led
motion](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-
saas-growth) sales demos are the center of your sales process.

And every sales product demo should start with a discovery.

The goal of the discovery is to unfold the pain points of your prospect.

(Here are [10 great sales discovery
questions](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexander-estner_b2bsales-
salesdiscovery-b2bsaas-
activity-6957936740011499520-CGRf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
that you can use to find the pain points of your customers).

But it’s not enough that you discover them. You need to get your prospects to
confirm that they have the pain. Because only if they are also aware of the
problem and the negative implications for them (if they don’t solve the
problem), they are ready to change something (buy your product).

And getting them to confirm is sometimes really painful.

1️⃣

**You:** _"Did I understand correctly, that you are having XYZ problem, which
leads to (negative result 1) and (negative result 2)?"_

**Prospect:** _"Yes, exactly"_

2️⃣

**You:** _"So what you said is that you already tried (alternative solution 1)
and (alternative solution 2), but it didn't solve the problem because of XYZ.
Is that correct?"_

**Prospect:** _"Yes, that's right"_

3️⃣

**You:** _"So, what I've noted down, is that it's the top priority for you to
solve problem X, because if you can't solve it, it will have (negative
implication 1) and (negative implication 2). Correct?"_

**Prospect:** _"Yes, unfortunately, that's true"_

Growth is about a mindset, it is being able to be consistent, process driven,
and optimizing your time.

You’re an SDR, you are not a founder. Book meetings, speak to your audience,
and grow through grit.

1️⃣ Network - Speak to anyone and everyone.

2️⃣ BAFAM - Book a meeting from a meeting - End your calls with “Thanks for
your time, I was wondering if you could introduce me to 3 other people that
you think this could help?”

3️⃣ E-mail campaigns - It’s not a dead channel, you’re doing it wrong. E-Mail
warm up your domains and limit sends to 50 emails per day.
[Instantly.ai](http://Instantly.ai) is a great tool for all of this.

4️⃣ Communities - chances are there are people talking about your problem in
forums or slack channels. Find them, speak to them and add value. Only
commercialize when it’s appropriate.
