 _**Want to reach 4500+ early-stage SaaS founders/leaders?**_
* * *

You want to create content for LinkedIn, but after a few posts, you are
running out of ideas?

This is how most founders I’ve worked with felt.

The good thing: There is a solution. You need to follow a clear framework, a
process. So you will never run out of content ideas.

**Here is the framework I follow to turn 1 content idea into 50+👇**

Those are the main topics you want to talk about. Topics your ideal customers
care about.

If you are early-stage, select topics that are rather BOFU (bottom of the
funnel) topics.

Now this is the step where you need to spend the most time. The goal is to
create high-quality long-form articles for the relevant topics. This could be
a ‘How to’ article or ‘Ultimate guides for X’ type of content.

Examples:

Once you have all the relevant content on a specific topic in your long-form
article, you can break it down into new, more specific, and shorter versions.

You take a piece of the long form and sharpen the content from a different
perspective.

Here are 8 examples of titles:

  * Best tips on TOPIC (e.g. Best tips to reduce sales cycles with mutual action plans)

  * Do's and Don'ts of TOPIC

  * Top 10 tips on TOPIC (e.g. Top 10 tips to reduce your SaaS churn rate)

  * X steps framework/guide to TOPIC

  * X reasons why TOPIC is important/hard

  * Biggest mistakes about TOPIC

  * Best tools for TOPIC

  * Best books/events/influencers/reports for TOPIC

Now based on the 1 long form title, you already have 8 new articles. So in
total have now 9 articles.

Now you can turn any of the blog posts/articles into multiple LinkedIn posts.

Let’s take again the example of the ‘Top 10 tips to reduce your SaaS churn
rate’.

You can easily create the following 6 LinkedIn posts:

  * text-only post

  * carousel

  * listicle

  * 1-page cheatsheet

  * (selfie-style) video (e.g. a 5-minute highlight video of the new blog post)

  * screen recording video (Loom video)

  * you can be very creative here and maybe find your own formats

Make sure that you always link to the long-form blog post on your video (but
not in the post, better as a comment on your post).

So let’s quickly do the math: 9 articles x 6 LinkedIn post formats = 54
LinkedIn posts.

A hack big creators like [Justin
Welsh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinwelsh/) leverage perfectly.

You create slightly different versions of each post - e.g. changing the hook
(first 3 lines of your post), while keeping the rest almost identical. Or you
rephrase it a bit, but keep the message the same.

Quick math: 54 posts x 5 versions = 250+ posts

Now you have 250+ posts ready to use.

Every 2-4 weeks, you can post about the ‘same’ topic again.

Don’t forget to analyze your posts. identify the posts that worked very well
and find patterns.

Reuse them again and schedule a new post.

Maybe you also want to slightly adapt the post (based on the learnings you
made so far).

But if you choose topics that are highly relevant to your ideal customers,
those are not getting ‘old’ - you can repurpose them over and over again.

With only 1 content topic you can end up with 250+ posts. Now with this
framework, you will never run out of ideas 🙂

Okay, this sounds complicated. But promise, it’s not.

Do you want to increase your prices? Normally everyone immediately thinks of
increasing the € number. So instead of 100€, selling it for 200€.

But then founders are worried about what customers would say.

**There is also another way you can increase the average revenue per account -
without really increasing the price.**

Instead of increasing the €, you decrease the value metric for your tiers.

Example: You are a newsletter software and you charge based on subscribers.

Let’s say you offer 3 plans:

So now instead of increasing your prices, you change the thresholds for the
value metric.

Example:

The result: You will see more clients in your Standard and Premium plans and
ultimately increase your ARPA.

Followers of your competitors are a great source of potential customers,
especially if you know what customers like and dislike about them (check
review sites like Capterra, OMR, etc. for insights, or obviously from your
conversations with customers).

On LinkedIn, you can follow 4 different approaches.

This is a bit sneaky, but it works. Create a fake LinkedIn profile, add
yourself as an employee of your competitors’ company, and then filter for
people, that follow ‘my company’.

[JB Jezequel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jb-jezequel-evaboot/), the founder
of [Evaboot](https://evaboot.com/) created an awesome video about it.

—> [How to do
it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C_3JY4qtPY&t=6s&ab_channel=JB-Evaboot)

Very similar approach to the first one, but here you don’t need to create a
fake account.

Instead of searching for company page followers, you go for creator followers.
This can be for instance the founder of your competitors.

In this approach, instead of going for specific followers, you try to reach
out to people who engage with (your competitors’) posts.

So all you need to do is:

  * Find a relevant post on Linkedin

  *   * or alternatively, use [Phantombuster](https://phantombuster.com/?deal=alex40) to export all post commenters

P.S. Of course this tactic is also possible not only for your competitors’
posts. If you find posts that fit perfectly the topic of your [ideal customer
profile](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-
profile), this can be an awesome trigger for your outreach (—> see [TAPSA
framework](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-perfect-cold-email-
tapsa-framework)).

This strategy is very similar to the one before. Here you need to use the
“**LinkedIn Event Guests Export”** phantom from
[Phantombuster](https://phantombuster.com/?deal=alex40).

P.S. Of course this tactic is also possible not only for your direct
competitors. Event participants (of a relevant topic your product covers) can
be a good trigger (intent data) in general.

P.P.S. Tools like [builtwith](https://builtwith.com/) also allow you to
identify companies using specific software (your competitor or also tools you
integrate with or are qualification criteria for you).

_Developer-led Growth Flywheel_

> Developer-led growth is a Go-To-Market approach that shares similarities
> with product-led growth (PLG) but has distinct differences in sales motion
> and strategy. PLG focuses on user acquisition, activation, and retention
> driven primarily by the product itself. Developer-led growth instead
> revolves around empowering developers and leveraging their advocacy to drive
> growth.

**Step 1: Understand the developer buying journey**

In the world of Business-To-Developers (B2D), developers have countless
internal and external touchpoints with your brand and product along the buying
journey. To get started with Developer-led Growth, you first need to
understand where developers come from, which questions they have, and what’s
driving them to use your product. (Shameless plug: This is something
[crowd.dev](https://www.crowd.dev/) can help you with.)

**Step 2: Create educational content**

In the next step, you take the learnings and insights from Step 1 and turn
them into ideas for content. More than for any other persona, educational
content is king for developers. High-quality technical documentation, blog
posts, video tutorials, live streams, and podcasts are great ways to
communicate your message and let developers learn about your expertise and
product. You should always keep in mind that it is about education, not
promotion. Developers will notice marketing from far away.

**Step 3: Share your content where developers hang out**

For distributing content, you should focus on platforms where developers hang
out (even in their free time), namely, GitHub, Twitter, Reddit, Stack
Overflow, HackerNews, or DEV. But also smaller platforms in your niche,
industry newsletters, or guest blog posts can be a great way to reach
developers with your content. As with almost everything, this should be a
trial-and-error process.

**Step 4: Build a community to turn developers into your advocates**

For developer-led growth, it's key to turn developers into advocates.
Developers trust their peers more than anything else, so your primary goal
should be to have users who go above and beyond for your product. The most
proven way to do this is to build a community around your product and allow
developers to feel like they are part of something bigger. We published a
whole guide on “[How to build a developer
community](https://www.crowd.dev/post/how-to-build-a-developer-community-a-
step-by-step-guide-2022)”.
