The success of your SaaS business depends a lot on your GTM success.

Over the last 12 months, I helped 15+ SaaS founders as a [GTM
advisor](https://cal.com/alexander-estner/15min-free-intro-call) to work on
their GTM.

My GTM advisory consists of 2 main parts:

Founders share access to all their relevant GTM assets.

I will do a 360-degree assessment (aka. GTM audit) of the status quo.

The result?

A clear understanding of

✅ what's working  
and  
❌ what's not

This sets the foundation for our 6-month GTM advisory.

We usually work in 2-weeks sprints. Each sprint consists of the top
priorities.

That way we have a clear focus and optimize for fast execution.

Today I want to share with you the 10 areas that you can use to self-assess
your GTM health. The same 10 areas I cover in my GTM audit.👇

I recommend you audit your GTM on 2 levels.  

1️⃣ **GTM Strategy**

2️⃣ **GTM Execution**

The [GTM strategy](https://alexestner.gumroad.com/l/saas-growth-worksheet)
sets the foundation for your GTM execution.

Without the right GTM strategy, your GTM activities will show 0 or very low
success.

Most founders jump right into growth tactics/execution.

🔥They want to spread the word.

🔥They want to be present on all different growth channels.

🔥They want to reach everyone.

But...

❌ Running [google ads](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/google-ads-guide) is
execution, not a strategy.

❌ Writing [blog posts](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-content-
marketing-guide) is execution, not a strategy.

❌ Doing [cold emails](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-4-must-have-sales-
email-templates) is execution, not a strategy.

But without a clear strategy, you will attract 0 clients.

Your conversion rates will be very low and you'll burn your money. 🔥

👉 [GTM Strategy](https://alexestner.gumroad.com/l/saas-growth-worksheet)
first, then [growth tactics](https://alexestner.gumroad.com/l/database-growth-
strategies-saas).

Ask yourself:

  * Do you have a clear ICP? Written down?

  * What are the criteria to qualify/disqualify

  * How is this applied in lead gen & CRM?

  * Do you know how to source/find your ICP?

If you don’t have a proper ICP for your SaaS business, work on it.

**Here are some actionable resources to get started:**

👉 [The Ultimate SaaS ICP Framework](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-
ideal-customer-profile)

Ask yourself:

  * Who is your direct & indirect competition?

  * What is your primary competitor (aka. status Quo)?

  * What sets you apart from the status quo?

  * How are you different from your direct competitors?

**Here are some actionable resources to get started:**

👉 [6 SaaS positioning angles](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-
positioning-6-different-ways)

👉 [3 types of competition](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/3-types-of-
competition)

Ask yourself:

  * How do you communicate what you do and for whom you are doing it?

  * How is the messaging applied on homepage, sales deck and emails?

**Here are some actionable resources to get started:**

👉 [Ultimate SaaS Messaging Framework](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-
ultimate-saas-messaging-framework)

Pricing for early-stage startups is NOT about optimizing growth.

I believe pricing should rather be good enough to NOT stopping you to grow to
1€ million ARR.

So it primarily is about:

✅ pricing model aligns with growth motion (sales-led vs. product-led)

✅ finding the right value metric (for a value-based pricing)

✅ getting clarity on packaging

So you need to analyze:

  * Packaging & Value Metrics

  * POC, Free Trials or Freemium

  * Pricing terms (contract length, payment schedule, cancellation policy)

**Here are some actionable resources to get started:**

👉 [The Ultimate SaaS Pricing Guide](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-
ultimate-b2b-saas-pricing-guide)

👉 [Optimize conversion rates with logos on pricing
page](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/increase-conversion-rates-with-customer-
logos)

👉 Subscribe to [Good Better Best
newsletter](https://goodbetterbest.substack.com/) (pricing-focused newsletter)  

Your GTM motion needs to align with your ICP, product category, and pricing
strategy.

If you’re early stage, don’t do both motions in parallel.

**Here are some actionable resources to get started:**

👉 [Product-led vs. Sales-Led](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/product-led-vs-
sales-led-saas-growth)

You need to measure your performance to see what’s working and what’s not.

Start with:

Review the last 12 months of performance

  * Understanding high level the progress over time

  * Focus on Leads, MQL, Deals, Customers, €

  * and especially conversion rates

  * do you have a Top or Bottom of the Funnel issue

**Here are some actionable resources to get started:**

👉 [Reverse engineer your sales goals](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/reverse-
engineering-template-saas)

👉 Financial plan for B2B SaaS ([Senovo VC
Template](https://medium.com/senovovc/senovo-b2b-saas-financial-
model-v4-0-9fe8d6d14c75))

Once you analyzed the strategy part, you can move on to your GTM execution.

Ask yourself:

  * Do you have a well-defined & executed sales process

  * What needs to happen to open a new deal?

  * What needs to happen to move deals through the pipeline

  * Do you follow a sales methodology? SPIN, MEDDIC etc.

**Here are some actionable resources to get started:**

👉 [Sales Methodologies for SaaS](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/sales-
qualification-discovery-calls)

The best way is to watch your call recordings.

  * Reviewing recordings of discovery calls and demos

  * How do you qualify prospects

  * How do you demo your tool?

I always hope that demos are NO Feature F****

 **Here are some actionable resources to get started:**

👉 [Sales Qualification (incl. 24
questions)](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/sales-qualification-discovery-calls)

👉[ Ultimate Guide for SaaS Sales Product
Demos](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-sales-product-
demos)

Analyze all the activities you are doing on the different channels.

See what is working and what not. Really deep dive into each channel.
