I’m speaking every week to early-stage SaaS founders and there are a lot of
myths about GTM, that I hear over and over again.

That’s why we cover in today’s newsletter the 10 most common misconceptions
about GTM for early-stage SaaS companies.

You can have the best product in the world but if nobody knows about it, how
will it sell?

If you have great features, that are making the life of the users easier, it
is also about how you present these to your customers.

You need to tell them about how these features enable them to do things that
they could not do without your product.

And this is the job of marketing and/or sales.

👉 So I’m sorry to tell you: You will have to learn how to sell it 🤠

Because in the end your success is a combination of 2 things:

1️⃣ good GTM will attract users, and

2️⃣ great products will keep the user.

Only if you do both, you will see success.

P.S. Even the best PLG products in the world, invest a lot in product
marketing, messaging etc.

If founders can’t acquire paying clients, they often suggest: ‘Let’s add a
free plan, so we grow faster…’.

Here’s the thing: In 95% of the cases, this will not solve your problem.

Instead do the following and then make a conscious decision if Freemium is a
good idea for your business.

**Step 1: Challenge yourself why you think you need a free plan**

  * Option 1: If the answer is, that you fear that users would not pay for the product, then most probably you are not solving a big enough problem. So with a free plan, you would just ‚delay‘ the decision in the future, if you solve a big enough problem (where users are willing to pay). This is not a good idea. Because it hurts a lot if you spend months or years building something and then realize that no one wants to pay for it.

  * Option 2: You want users to test the product (without paying). Then you still have the option to offer a free trial (for a limited period, e.g. 14 days).

**Step 2: Make sure your market is big enough (most probably it’s not)**

There is a good article from [Jason Lemkin](https://www.saastr.com/you-
need-50-million-users-for-freemium-to-actually-work/) about it. It says that
you need around 50 million active users to make Freemium work (if you want to
build a 100€ million ARR business).

Here’s the math behind it:

  * Let’s assume a 10€/month subscription (or 100€ per year).

  * So you need 1 million paying users (each paying 100€ per year).

  * With a 2% conversion rate from active to paying users, you would need 50 million active users for your product

👉 this is not the case for most SaaS products

So I’m not against freemium at all. I just believe that most early-stage SaaS
startups (that are not attracting millions of users like Zoom, Canvas, and
Linkedin of the world) are better off with free trials.

This myth includes 2 things.

1️⃣ Do you track your lost reasons properly?

2️⃣ Are you sure it’s a pricing issue or rather that you’re not delivering
enough value?

This being said, of course, theoretically this could be true. But what I see
most of the time, is that ‚being too expensive’ is not among the top lost
reasons. It’s rather the opposite, I see that most startups undercharge their
product.

But to fix this and get a clear understanding of your lost reasons, here are a
few things I advise doing:

✅ Track your lost reasons (dropdown in your CRM with pre-defined lost reasons)

✅ Reach out to them and ask for real reasons

✅ For PLG: add a custom cancellation flow/ exit survey if they don’t convert
after the free trial (+ send them an email)

And if you see ‘too expensive’ among your top lost reasons, then this means
the prospect did not understand/experience the full value of your product.

Then there are 2 things to do:

✅ Revamp the way you present the value (Messaging, Sales Demo, Value
Proposition)

✅ Revamp your product, so it solves a big (enough) problem

Bonus: Analyze lost reason per customer segment. Focus on the ones with a
higher willingness to pay for your product.

This is not true. Every company has competition.

I like to separate between [3 types of
competition](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/3-types-of-
competition).

1️⃣ The DIRECT competition

Those are companies, that do the same.

2️⃣ The INDIRECT competition

Also referred to as alternative solutions. There are other ways you can
achieve the same result/ fix the problem, including Excel, manual work, hiring
someone, or patching together non-purpose tools

—> Check out [April Dunford’s Positioning
book](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/April-Dunford/dp/1999023005) to learn more
about it.

3️⃣ Status Quo

NOT DOING ANYTHING. Prospects stick to what they do right now.

It’s most of the time your biggest competitor and number 1 lost reason.

So when you need to position yourself in the market, you need to think about
these different types of competition.

Because this is how prospects will evaluate and compare you.

Bonus: And if there is no competition, there is no problem to fix. So this is
a problem for you.💡

It’s important to understand that there is a difference between Growth Tactics
AND GTM Strategy.

I like to separate between:

It’s your strategic foundation. Without this, all your tactics will show 0
results.

Your GTM strategy includes:

✅ Ideal Customer Profile

✅ Positioning

✅ Messaging & Value Proposition

✅ Pricing

✅ Sales Process

Create your powerful [GTM strategy using my Free
Workbook](https://alexestner.gumroad.com/l/saas-growth-worksheet) (helped
3000+ SaaS founders).

Running Google Ads, Posting Content on Linkedin, Doing Outbound
Emails/Sequences, and Running weekly webinars.

These are all tactics, depending on the growth/marketing channels you choose.

The right channels and tactics depend on your GTM strategy (mainly on ICP and
Pricing).

Growth activities are what you need to do. Your (daily) input.

Like sending 5 Emails a day to ICP and commenting on 10 LinkedIn posts or
publishing 1 blog post per week

Things you do  _consistently._

👉 You need to have a solid GTM Strategy first, otherwise, you will just burn a
lot of money (as none of the tactics and activities you do will show
conversions

**Bonus:**

When founders approach me and say our LinkedIn posts are not working or our
outbound emails get 0 responses, the problem is most of the time not that they
do not post enough, or that they don’t send enough emails - it’s a strategy
problem (they target the wrong people, they position their product in the
wrong way, they do not hit message-market fit)

As an early-stage startup, you don’t have the resources to serve everyone.

So say goodbye to your FOMO and start with your initial customers (Beachhead
segment 🏖).

It might be true, that long term the product could be used by different types
of companies, from small to enterprise. But this is not where you start. Each
segment has a different GTM motion.

A powerful ICP is also more than Role + Company Industry + Region

For me, a powerful ICP is the combination of

1️⃣ Ideal Personas (User + Buyer)

2️⃣ Ideal Company

👉 I’ve created an [ICP framework](https://miro.com/miroverse/customer-profile-
framework-saas-
template/?utm_source=sfmc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=s_mrs_3_request_changes)
that includes more than 40 data points, including things like:

✅ Jobs to be done

✅ Pains & Challenges

✅ Metrics

✅ Daily activities

✅ software they use

✅ the content they consume

✅ important Trigger Events / Intent data

PLG is great, and I would encourage most founders starting now, to build the
product in a way, that enables self-service.

But it’s not a magic bullet and it does not mean, that you should always do
it.

In the early stage, there is nothing more valuable than talking to potential
customers daily. So doing demos & onboarding calls with prospects gives you a
lot of feedback.

PLG is not for every SaaS product, generally speaking, it works better if

✅ rather lower MRR

✅ fast time to value

✅ not complex

✅ works in a single-player mode

So if PLG is the right solution, depends.

I’m shadowing a lot of sales demos. And it happens a lot, that instead of a
demo, I see more of a product training.

And I know it’s tempting because you as a founder, love your product and want
to show them everything.

But, a good demo focuses on the most important pain points/challenges of your
prospect and shows them only the features that improve/change this.

So don’t make it complex for them to follow. A demo is not product training.
The goal of a demo is to get them excited/hooked, to invest more time/energy
to try the product, and see the overall value of it.

SaaS Product Demo Guide](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-

“We’re not growing, so we need to add more channels.”

This is something I hear quite a lot. But the truth is, each channel works
differently. Each channel takes time to master. Each channel takes resources.
And all this means €€€.

And €€€ is what’s mostly limited in the early stage.

So It’s better to focus on 1-2 channels that work and do more on these. Once
you gain more traction, you can expand to other areas.

Of course, to find those 1-2 channels that work, this could mean doing smaller
tests for different channels.

Here it’s also important to keep in mind, that some channels take longer
naturally to get results (e.g. SEO, Partnerships), while others get instant
results (Google Ads, Outbound).

Churn is like a ‚leaky bucket‘. You keep adding new customers on top, but you
will lose them at the bottom. This means you’re not growing, you’re just
burning money.

So please do not invite more people into a broken product.

Fix the holes in the bucket first, before you spend more money on adding new
users.

Retention is a great indicator of Product Market Fit.

I always advise founders to

1️⃣ Track their churn rates

2️⃣ work on retention, if they see unhealthy churn rates.

Because if you don’t do that, you will burn a lot of cash. Cash you spend to
acquire new customers, but if they don’t stick your CLV will be low and never
really start to grow.

As I work as an advisor with the SaaS founders, this is also something I hear
quite a lot.

Are you doing then the GTM Strategy FOR us????

My answer is always: NO

It’s the founders’ job to build their GTM. I’m just helping them to do the
right things at the right time, keep them accountable, and reduce trial and
error.

But it’s still them who need to do the operational stuff.

They need to go out and talk to potential customers to understand:

to figure out messaging that resonates with them.

They need to win their first clients, find patterns, iterate, and build their
first version of GTM.

Don’t hire too early first sales manager and marketeer. It’s the job of the
co-founders to do this early on. To build a GTM playbook.

Once you find, something that works, you can go from founder sales to founder-
led sales.
