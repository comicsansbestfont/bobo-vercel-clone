Messaging is the foundation for most of your sales & marketing assets.

Messaging is one of the key elements of a powerful go-to-market strategy.
Positioning lays the foundation for your messaging. And the ideal customer
profile defines the right way to communicate to/with them. That’s why [Ideal
Customer Profile](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-
profile) (ICP), [Positioning](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-
positioning-6-different-ways), and Messaging come as a GTM triangle.

Without clear messaging, it’s really hard for you to communicate consistently
to your ideal customers - and most probably your message does not resonate
with them. That’s what we call [Message-Market
fit](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/hit-message-market-
fit-b2b-saas-startup).

Your messaging is the foundation to build your key assets like:

Without a messaging framework, every time you write an email, build a new
landing page, or pitch your product, you use different words, different
narratives, and different ways to communicate your product and the value
proposition - You basically always start at zero.

That’s why I’m a big supporter that you should create your own messaging
framework. The messaging framework should be your ‘go-to’ source, shared in
the organization and being the foundation for your sales & marketing
activities.

We will go into each element of the SaaS messaging framework.

🚨But before we break down the different elements of the messaging framework,
it’s important that you keep the following in mind.

**Messaging:** The main points you want to say to your customers **Copy:**
Copy is HOW you communicate it. It's the exact words.

So basically, messaging defines your copy. Copy can/should change based on the
channel, medium, buyer stage etc.

The messaging framework includes the answers for:

  * What's happening in the market / What's the status quo & what's the problem with that (the Gap)

  * Why should your customers care? (what’s in for them)

  * Why now? What’s the cost of inaction?

  * Why you? What is your POV on the market and how do you set yourself apart from the competition (unique differentiator)?

  * Why should customers trust you? What social proof can you share and what results do your customers normally see?

The 5 parts (+1 bonus part) of the SaaS Messaging Framework:

  1. The Market

  2. Your Ideal Customer Profile

  3. The Competitive Alternatives

  4. Your Product

  5. The Value Proposition

and the Bonus: The POV/Sales Story.

Let’s get into them.

It all starts with the market insight or some specific changes. It’s about
context setting. It’s the reason why a specific problem occurs.

Based on this, you need to ask yourself what is the (high-level) problem. What
is the (negative) consequence of the market insight.

Here’s an example for Calendly:

The next step is to answer:

> 💡 Who’s facing this problem? Who’s affected by this (the most)?

**Important Note:** If you target multiple segments with different (buyer)
personas, you need to duplicate the framework and create multiple ones.

Example: VP of Sales and Head of Customer Success --> Create 2 assets (for
each persona)

Probably it’s best if we have a look again at the Calendly example:

So now you know the problem and who’s affected by the problem.

But as you might know, customers have multiple options to fix the problem - in
99% of the time, there are multiple solutions.

> 💡 P.S. I recommend you create your [ideal customer profile based on this
> guide](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-2-parts-of-a-powerful-
> ideal-customer) or simply use my [GTM
> Workbook](https://alexestner.gumroad.com/l/saas-growth-worksheet).

The next step is to understand the competitive alternatives.

  * What are they doing right now and/or what would your customers do, if your solution doesn't exist?

  * What other options do your customers have right now to deal with the problem/situation?

  * What are the pros and cons of each for the different types of customers?(acknowledge that there are always multiple options)

Keep in mind: It’s about creating different CLUSTERS of alternatives. This is
not only direct competition. I would recommend to follow these 3 steps:

Bonus: You can build Competition Battlecards for each single competitor (but
it's not part of this messaging framework).

Let’s have a look at Calendly again:

Until now, the messaging was not a single time about you. And that’s good.
Good messaging is customer-centric, not seller-centric. But now it’s finally
time to talk about how great you are 😇

It’s about 3 main parts:

  1. Your product category - CRM, Scheduling, Project Management etc.

  2. Capabilities - What is it that your customers can do now, that they can’t without your product

  3. Features - The specific parts of your product that enable the capabilities.

**How to find your top features & capabilities?**

But now, let’s have a look at our Calendly example:

Now the final step is to work on your value proposition.

Now you know your ideal customer profile, the problem, the alternative
solutions, and how your product is better than these solutions to fix the
problem of your [ICP](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-
profile).

The last step is now to connect these elements and craft your value
proposition. It’s about the benefits of your customers (What’s in for them).

So let’s have a look at the different messaging elements.

It all starts with the results. What is your product increasing or decreasing?
The benefits are the opposite of the problems.

And it makes sense to distinguish between functional benefits and social and
emotional benefits.

And as benefits alone are not enough, it’s crucial to also add social proof
messaging elements as well as objection handling (including Why now aka. Cost
of Inaction) to the framework.

Let’s see this in action with our Calendly example:

Now you can combine the different messaging elements and build your Sales
Story. It's your unique POV.

> **Prioritize Prototyping: Learn and Test Before Committing Resources to
> Development**

Failure: In my past company, we spent a significant amount on development
without fully testing the concept with real clients. Our assumption seemed
solid, but we realized that without prototyping and obtaining real client
feedback, we were working in the dark.

Learning: At Sharpei, we adopted a different approach by initiating our
process with a Figma prototype and actively seeking input from actual clients.
This strategic move enabled us to unearth critical flaws, facilitating timely
and vital adjustments. By dedicating time and resources to preliminary
testing, we averted the risk of channeling valuable resources into a product
misaligned with genuine market needs. It's crucial to remember that feedback
is an invaluable asset; it guides your product along the correct course and
helps sidestep unnecessary expenditures.
