I’m sure you set goals for your SaaS- mostly revenue goals.

I want to achieve 1€ million ARR in the next 18 months.

But then most SaaS founders stop.

Setting (ambitious) goals is just step 1.

Step 2 is to calculate backward to know HOW to achieve these goals. Knowing
what you need to achieve every month, week (or even per day).

That’s where reverse engineering comes in place.

  1. You set ‘top-down’ goals

  2. You define ‘assumptions’ - ACV, conversion rates and sales cycle.

  3. Then you can calculate backward to know every step of your funnel (website impressions, leads contacted, demos, customers)

You need to modify the plan for your business and feel free to adapt it (e.g.
include churn rate, add a product-led motion).

But that’s not the point here.

The power of reverse engineering is breaking a hard-to-grasp goal into very
specific short-term goals. Something you can work on within your daily
operation.

**Hard to grasp**

❌ We need to close 800k€ in the next 12 months

vs.

**Easy to work within your day-to-day business**

💪 We need to contact 200 leads per month and have 10 demos per month

Of course, you can break it down even further…

You need an easy and compelling way to explain what your SaaS does.

Because you need it all the time….

…whether you are on a cold call with a prospect

…or a networking event meeting potential investors

…or writing your next [outbound email
sequences](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-perfect-cold-email-tapsa-
framework)

…or working on your [website](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-perfect-
homepage-for-early-stage-saas)

…or crafting your [sales deck](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-perfect-
sales-deck-template)

…or writing your next [LinkedIn post](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/simple-
value-proposition-canvas)

…or being in an elevator with a potential client 🥳

The list goes on.

But if you don’t train your 1-sentence elevator pitch, you start improvising,
which usually leads to becoming the ‘in-depth’ person or the ‘unspecific’
person.

Create your version of the 1-sentence value proposition and then ‘use’ it as
often as possible and iterate on it. Every conversation with potential clients
is a chance to train.

Do this until you feel comfortable with it and you can pitch it in a very
natural way.

If you see potential customers, investors, and partners telling you that they
fully understand your product and its value, then you’ve found your powerful
elevator pitch.

> 1️⃣ **(Persona)** of/working in **(company type)** need/try to doing
> **(usecase)** usually use **(current solution)**.

> 2️⃣ But the **(current solution)** comes with a few limitations, like
> **(limitation1)** and **(limitation2)** , leading to **(pain point 1/
> problem 1)** and **(pain point 2 / problem 2).**

  * -> What is it that you offer (product category)

  * -> What can they do with it (product capability)

  * -> What are the benefits/results for them

> 3️⃣ That's why we are building **(product name)** , a **(product category)**
> , that enables **(ICP)** to do **(capability 1)** , **(capability 2)** and
> **(capability 3)** , leading to **(benefit 1)** and **(benefit 2)**.

Here’s an example of how this could sound for a product like Canva.

> _(Non design-savvy) Solopreneurs try creating nice visual LinkedIn carousels
> & cheatsheets using Photoshop._
>
> _But using Photoshop as a non-designer comes with a few limitations, like
> it's hard to learn and it does not provide any ready-to-use templates,
> leading to low-quality content and huge time invested to produce good
> content._
>
> _That's why we are building Canva, an online design software, that enables
> non-designers to create visual content without design skills with templates,
> leverage AI to start from scratch, and collaborate with others on your
> designs, leading high-quality content in minutes._

P.S. It’s the result of the [simple Value Proposition
Canvas](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/simple-value-proposition-canvas). that I
shared in my previous episode _**👇**_

ARR per FTE is a great metric to know how you're doing. It’s revenue (ARR) per
full-time employee (FTE).

Kyle Poyar wrote a great [guide on ARR per
employee](https://www.growthunhinged.com/p/your-guide-to-arr-per-fte).

For you, it means keeping a close eye on your efficiency. Is your growth to 1€
million ARR healthy?

Track the following 2 metrics to be sure you’re on the right way:

  1. **ARR per FTE**

  2. **CAC payback period**

It tells you how long it takes you (in months) to recover from the customer
acquisition costs and start making profits.

**CAC Payback Period Formula (€) CAC / [ (€) ARPA x (%) Gross Margin ] =
Months to Recover**

Average benchmark: You should stay below 12 months. If you have very low churn
and high LTVs your payback period can also be 12-18 months. But ideally, you
aim for a 4-6 month payback period.

  1. **Do you have too many FTE (in sales/marketing) compared to revenue?**

—> Follow founder-led sales and don’t hire too early in your GTM team.

  2. **Analyze your customers and make sure you focus on your[ideal customers](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile)**

—> Identify segments that show better numbers (e.g. higher ACV, lower churn,
faster sales cycle)

  3. **Pricing - do you charge enough?**

—> Lots of startups undercharge for their product, leading to unhealthy
CAC:LTV, making it hard to invest in the right channels. (—> [Ultimate Pricing
Guide](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-b2b-saas-pricing-guide))

  4. **Growth Channels - Do you bet on the right channels?**

—> Not all channels show the same success. They all come with different CACs.

  5. **Experiment with Upselling, Annual payments & Set-Up Fees**

—> Depending on your target market, there’s a chance you can optimize your
payback period by upselling (increase ACVs), asking for guaranteed upfront
yearly payments, and also charging additional set-up fees (who can cover the
CACs).
