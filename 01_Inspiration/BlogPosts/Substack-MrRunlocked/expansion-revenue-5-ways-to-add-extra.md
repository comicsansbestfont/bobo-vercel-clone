Expansion revenue is all the revenue you make with your existing customers on
top of the initial revenue (based on what they signed up for in the
beginning).

**Here is a simple example.**

🔸 You have 100 customers, each paying 5k€ ARR (initially)

🔸 10% are upgrading to your Premium plan for 10k€ ARR

🔸 This adds 50k€ ARR (10*5k€ ARR) to your bank account

So you have in total 550k€ ARR (instead of 500k€). That's a 10% growth.

The 50k€ ARR is your Expansion Revenue (normally referred to as Expansion MRR
or Expansion ARR).

So this example makes it obvious why expansion is so beautiful.

You are adding new revenue to your business without adding new customers. And
especially also without the cost of new customers (your CACs).

This means it’s normally a way more (cost) efficient way of growing your
business.

So growing your business with expansion revenue positively affects your key
SaaS metrics.

**1️⃣ Increase your LTV (Lifetime Value)**

If your customers pay more every month for your product, over the time of
their lifetime (until they churn), they will pay more. So your Customer's
Lifetime value increases over time.

**2️⃣ Improve LTV to CAC ratio**

As a result of your increased LTV, the ratio between LTV to CACs gets also
better. The ratio is one of the key metrics to track in your SAAS business.
The better the ratio, the faster your payback period (the time it takes to
cover your customer acquisition costs).

Example: You pay 1000€ to acquire a new customer. The customers buy your
product for 200€ per month. So it takes you 5 months to fully recover your
customer acquisition costs. Your payback period is 5 months.

3️⃣ **(Net) Revenue churn rate**

The revenue churn rate is of the 2 types of churn rate. In SaaS, you
differentiate between revenue churn and logo churn (customer churn).

Expansion Revenue positively affects your revenue churn rate, and hopefully
enables you to achieve net negative churn. This means every month you are
making more revenue from existing customers than you are losing from churning
customers.

Example: Let’s say you have 100 customers, each paying you 50€ per month. This
means you have 5000€ MRR at the beginning of the month. Now 10% of them are
upgrading to your premium product for 100€ per month. This means you are
adding 500€ expansion MRR (10 _50€) to your business. At the same time, 7 of
your customers are churning this month. This means you are losing 350€ MRR (7_
50€). Your expansion revenue (500€) is more than your churn revenue (350€). At
the end of the month, your revenue is 5150€ MRR. This means you have net
negative churn.

Now we take a look at 5 ways to add extra revenue to your SaaS business
without adding new customers👇

**1️⃣ Value-Based Pricing**

You need to understand the core value the product offers to your customer and
find the right value-metric for it. With the right value metric in place, you
have a pricing that scales with your customers. The more they use the product,
the more they need your value metric, and the more they pay you. Check out the
[SaaS Pricing Strategy Guide](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-
pricing-strategy) to learn more about it.

2️⃣ **Feature-based Pricing**

You offer different pricing packages where you are gating your features. To
make this work you need to clearly understand the needs of the different
customer segments and find ways to upgrade them over time from your basic
plans to your premium plans.

3️⃣ **Track user intent signals**

This one is more tactical and relies on a good pricing strategy (see point 1
and 2).

  * Step 1: start tracking your customers’ product usage.

  * Step 2: Create indicators that you know that they are ready for upselling. This could be for example if someone uses feature X (part of your Basic plan) a lot, you know that feature Z (part of your Premium plan) is probably valuable for them.

  * Step 3: Now you know the data and know when to act. Now it’s time to act. This can be in-product messages, email campaigns, email outreach, sales calls etc.

4️⃣ **Incentivize Upgrades**

Make it easier for them to experience the expensive plans. Examples are free
trials, discounts for existing customers, or great consultations with customer
success (calls or webinars).

5️⃣ **Enable frictionless in-product upgrades**

If it’s possible for you, make it frictionless. The best upgrades just happen
without anyone being involved - no sales calls, no credit card checkout. PLG
or SLG, doesn’t really matter, in both cases make the experience as
frictionless as possible.

You know that I’m helping early-stage B2B SaaS founders to grow from 0€ to 1M€
ARR with a powerful GTM strategy.

At the moment I do this in two ways: **Advisory/Sparring** & **Consulting.**

As many of you ask for it, I’m now launching a 3rd way 🎉.

A **12-week GTM coaching program for early-stage B2B SaaS founders and
leaders**.

The program will help you:

✅ to identify the key drivers for your business growth

✅ to build and run an effective and scalable GTM strategy

✅ to do the right things at the right time (proven frameworks)

✅ to hold yourself accountable to get things done

founders).**

A lot of founders try to improve their sales and marketing activities on a
daily base. They improve the visuals, better tracking, more sales calls, and
more email prospecting.

And don’t get me wrong, iteration is the only way to go.

But sometimes the problem is more fundamental. I’m talking about your GTM.

Your GTM sucks if...

❌ You send 100 emails but 0 responses

❌ You get 1000 impressions, but 0 sign ups

❌ You run Google ads, but 0 conversions

❌ You have 10 sales demos, but 0 won deals.

If this sounds like you, then you probably lack a proper GTM strategy.

There are 3 main elements that could be the reason:

**🔶 Wrong/unclear Ideal Customer Profile**

Here are the 2 things I see the most:

🔶 Wrong/unclear [Messaging](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/hit-
message-market-fit-b2b-saas-startup) &
[Positioning](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-
positioning-6-different-ways)

Here are the things I see the most:

  * being unspecific about our own positioning (Premium player vs. low-cost player) and who we target (Enterprise vs. SMB)

  * talk a lot about features, but miss the key parts of value proposition, capabilities, and results.

  * having a hard time clearly communicating the product, why it matters, and the benefits in a way that the customers get it (a lot about copywriting and sales skills).

🔶 Wrong/unclear Sales Motion

Things that I face a lot:

  * We do product-led growth ([PLG](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-saas-growth)) because it’s the way to go (even if customers may prefer [sales-led growth](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-saas-growth))

  * a very unstructured sales process (every new sign-up or [sales demo](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-sales-product-demos) looks different)

  * the CRM is not aligned with the way new signups/demos are handled

You need a proper GTM strategy first, then you can focus on growth tactics.

👉 So take a few moments, step back from your daily operational hustle, and
work on your GTM strategy. Get my [FREE
Workbook](https://alexestner.gumroad.com/l/saas-growth-worksheet) (helped
1800+ SaaS professionals) to bring your GTM to paper.

The market strategy is step 1 of a powerful GTM strategy.

And I know, everyone (including me) tells you to understand our market and
customers.

But this time I’m not talking about your ICP. ****A lot of founders jump right
into the specific details and miss out on the bigger picture.

So take a step back and look at the market from a higher level.

**Your job is to clearly understand:**

  * What is happening/changing (at a higher level) in the market (macro trend) right now?

  * Why do your customers need to care (now) about your product?

  * What is the underlying force that powers your business?

  * What is not changing over the next weeks?

Macro trends and specific events are your friends. They are the reason why
your customers care about the topic.

Here are some great examples (of course there are many more):

**1️⃣ Mental health** 👉 Companies like [Evermood](https://www.evermood.com/),
[Lene](https://lene-health.de/),
[Meditopia](https://meditopia.com/de/forwork/) makes use of the ever-
increasing mental health issues of workforces.

**2️⃣ New Regulations (GDPR, OZG, CSR Reporting)**

👉 New regulations, like the German OZG (Onlinezugangsgesetz), GDPR or CSR
reporting laws cater to companies like [Locaboo](https://www.locaboo.com/),
[Datenschutzexperte](https://www.datenschutzexperte.de/),
[PlanA](https://de.plana.earth/),

trends) for inspiration.

**Tip: Create high-converting landing pages**

>  _B2B marketers have a super simple way to increase their conversions. Just
> let your website visitors walk through the product themselves before they
> book a meeting._ Companies are seeing at least a 30% increase in conversions
> by adding interactive demos on their homepage.

**Breakdown of a perfect landing page**

  * The hero section: Build curiosity & grab attention

  * Product in action: Show, don't tell

  * Social proof: Provide validation

  * Amplify their pain & offer a solution

  * Introduce features with benefit-led messaging

**Ready to use landing page template**
