Every SaaS business wants to increase its monthly recurring revenue (MRR) or
annual recurring revenue (ARR). So in order to grow the revenue, you need to
understand what influences your SaaS growth.

[Joel York](http://chaotic-flow.com/media/saas-growth-strategy.pdf) defines
the growth of a SaaS company as the following:

> **SaaS Growth = Acquisition Rate x Average Customer Lifetime Value**

This means you can influence your SaaS growth by optimizing at least one of
the following parts:

1\. Net Growth Customers:

… Adding more new customers (new customer growth)

… Reduce churn of customers (churn rate)

2\. Average Revenue per Account (ARPA)

… Upselling & Cross-selling

… Pricing

3\. Customer Lifetime (Churn Rate)

… or simply said by **a) adding new customers** , **b) reducing the loss of
existing customers (churn)** , and **c) increasing the average revenue per
customer (CLV).**

So as you can see there are different ways how you can positively influence
your SaaS growth.

In this article we will cover how to calculate your ARPA, the differences
between ARPA, ARPU, MRR, and ARR, and 3 ways how you can increase the average
revenue per account (ARPA) for your B2B SaaS business.

ARPA is the average revenue per account and one of the most relevant SaaS
metrics. It shows the average revenue you generate from your customers on a
monthly (or yearly) basis.

Maybe you’ve already come across the term ARPU, which means the average
revenue per user. But ARPA and ARPU are not the same, there is a slight
difference between both metrics. While ARPA indicates the average revenue you
make with an account, ARPU is the average revenue per user. Here is an
example: You are selling a CRM software to SMB companies with 5€ per user per
month pricing and you have 3 accounts (customers): Company A with 10 users;
Company B with 20 users and Company C with 90 users, then you will have:

By increasing your ARPA you are obviously also increasing your MRR (monthly
recurring revenue) and ARR (annual recurring revenue). MRR and ARR are always
the total revenue you’re generating. To use the example above, you will have:

So to make it easy:

MRR = Total monthly recurring revenue

ARPU = MRR / total users

ARPA = MRR / total customers (accounts)

Working on your [pricing
strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-pricing-strategy)
gives you great opportunities to increase your ARPA. Here are some examples of
how to use pricing to positively influence your ARPA.

If you increase your pricing, obviously your average revenue per account will
increase too. But increasing your prices needs to be done carefully and well
prepared, especially if you have already (a large number of) customers. Here
are some things you should consider:

  * Price increases only for new customers (grandfathering) or also for existing customers?

  * Enough notice period for existing customers (minimum 3 months in advance)

  * Combine the price change with the release of a powerful new feature and a strong focus on value selling (Why the new pricing is better for them)

  * Make it super simple and clear about how it works (Do they need to upgrade? How can they cancel? What are the consequences of the new pricing (e.g. new features, limited access...)?

  * Prepare yourself for churn & increased support issues

Increasing prices normally lead to a short-term peak in churn, but the overall
positive effects (increased ARPA) outweigh the negative ones.

If you’re having more than one pricing tier, think about ways how you can
nudge customers to your more expensive pricing tiers. Here are some ways to do
so:

  * Highlight the most popular tier ([Isolation Effect](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/10-hands-on-tips-for-saas-pricing?s=w))

  * [Price anchoring](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/10-hands-on-tips-for-saas-pricing?s=w) (make your more expensive tier 'relatively' cheap compared to the cheaper options, so your customers get the feeling that this is a 'great deal')

  * Incentivize annual payments

  * Remove your free/cheapest plan: try to hide your cheapest plan (and see if the conversion rate gets negatively affected, if not you should see an increase in your ARPA)

  * Less advertising of cheaper plans (especially if most of your existing customers use your free/cheapest plan)

Make sure that you have scalable pricing in place. Scalable means that the
more your customers use the product, the more value they get from your product
and the higher the pricing should be.

It’s crucial to identify the value metric for your product. [Wes
Bush](https://productled.com/blog/value-metrics/) says that the right value
metric needs to be

So in case, your current pricing isn’t scalable, change the value metric to a
‘scalable’ metric like bookings, (active) users, revenue generated, views,
etc.

Sometimes the pricing tiers are not aligned with the usage patterns and
different types of customers. Make sure that every pricing tier fits perfectly
to a specific customer type, e.g. perfect plan for small companies and
startups vs. a plan for larger companies. If you’re choosing the right value
metric for your pricing, this normally happens automatically. A CRM Software
provider charging based on the number of leads, a newsletter tool charging
based on subscribers, or an accounting tool based on revenue is automatically
appealing for small companies as well as larger companies because the more
they use the product (e.g. more leads, more subscribers, more revenue) the
higher the value for them and the more they are willing to pay. So your
interest (more MRR) and the interest of your customer (more value) are
aligned.

Using features as your value metric is also possible, but it is always
challenging to know which feature is part of which pricing plan. How do you
know what features your customers want and which ones to include in each tier?

The best way is to analyze the current user behavior and track the usage of
different features. Can you see specific patterns (e.g. the more users use
feature A, the more they need feature B? Or feature A can only be used with
feature C? Customers will less than 10 users almost never use feature D...).
Once those patterns are identified, you can restructure your pricing plans.

Often times all your focus lies on adding new customers and your existing
customers don’t get enough attention. Figure out ways to add more value to
them and ultimately increase your ARPU.

There are different ways how you can upsell to your existing customers.
Upselling (in contrast to cross-selling) means selling more of the existing
product. Most of the time this means you need to focus on helping your
customers to become more successful (e.g. getting more bookings, increasing
their subscriber base...) because this results in higher usage of your
product.

Here are some ways to do so:

  * Dedicated Customer Success/ Account Management with regular Customer meetings (for Mid-market and Enterprise)

  * (Product) Webinars for existing customers (show them new features, success stories, best practices)

  * In-product messaging (incentivize to use premium features or to increase the activity of features)

  * Notifications for Sales/Customer Success Team on specific product usage (e.g. customer XY added 200 more users but they never activated their accounts —> huge upselling potential)

When you’ve chosen the right value metric (that scales with product usage,
e.g. more users) think about ways how you can get more users in the product
(e.g. using viral features like inviting coworkers, sharing dashboard/links
with nonusers, sending emails or notifications from the tool). Those viral
features not only increase the ARPA for these specific customers but most
probably also helps you to get new leads to your [SaaS
Funnel](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/5-steps-to-master-your-
saas-growth).

Olof Mathé ([How to master product
virality](https://productled.com/blog/product-virality/)) gives a great
overview of the different types of viral features.

Especially when you have a scalable pricing metric (e.g. active users) there
is huge revenue potential in activating your customers. Actually, this
strategy is part of Upselling but is so important that I’ve added it as a
separate point.

One of the best ways to identify the revenue potential is to look for
‘potential’ that’s currently not captured within your tool. Here are some
examples to make it easier to understand:

  * Communication Software for Teams: The company size is 200 FTE but currently only 20 employees are active users —> huge revenue potential in the missing 180 employees

  * Sales CRM software: currently only the MDR and SDR roles using your sales prospecting feature, rest of the sales team using another CRM tool —> huge revenue potential in getting the other team members to use your features

  * Employee Benefits Software: only one of the benefits is being used by the company, the other benefits are managed somewhere else —> huge revenue potential to activate the users to use more of your benefits

Cross-selling refers to selling new additional products to existing customers.
Here are some great ways to increase your ARPA with cross-selling:

  * Promote your other products to your customers (ideally contextual, e.g. after they asked the support team a specific question, or after they clicked on a specific feature, or as part of a specific product webinar...)

  * Add a marketplace to your product (with integration partners) and maybe earn commissions

  * Create product bundles and offer discounts/free trials

  * Account Manager: Understand customer needs and offer valuable products (or services)

  * Offer Add-ons like Premium Support, Quarterly training, Priority Onboarding, Migration Service...

Depending on what kind of churn (logo churn vs. revenue churn) you’re looking
for, churn can actually influence your ARPA. Imagine that especially customers
with high MRR are churning, your ARPA will decrease. On the other hand, if you
manage to lower the churn (from your top accounts) you will increase your
ARPA.

P.S. Make sure you understand the difference between logo churn and revenue
churn (check out [Ryan Law’s blog post on logo churn vs. revenue
churn](https://www.cobloom.com/blog/customer-churn-vs-revenue-churn-whats-the-
difference)).

Here’s a list of methods you can use to prevent churn:

Analyze patterns of customer churning and identify activities that indicate
churn potential, e.g. decreasing usage over weeks (fewer log-ins, messages, or
bookings) or low NPS score. Use that information to trigger counter
initiatives (e.g. call with customer success, email campaign...)

Never forget to always communicate the value of your product. Also, existing
customers want to get reminded of the value of your product. Just imagine the
difference between getting an email with the invoice and just seeing the
amount they need to pay compared to an email with the invoice, but putting the
value in the center, not the costs.

> 💯 Last month we helped you to get 500 new leads and close 15 new deals which
> have led to a 15000€ new MRR. Thanks for trusting XYZ CRM software. We’ve
> invoiced you 499€ for last month.

So make sure you always add the value of your product in your communication
(e.g. on your invoice, in your product update emails, on your product
dashboard...). If customers are aware of the value of your product, the chance
they churn is way lower.

If you are in the mid-market or enterprise market you probably need to have an
account manager for your customer. Make sure to regularly talk to your clients
and make sure to provide value to them. Maybe you’re analyzing their data,
sharing best practices with them, or offering additional training for their
employees. But most importantly proactively make sure they are happy with the
product and actively using it. If you see a drop in usage or customer
satisfaction, offer them support.

But also if you’re in the prosumer and SMB market it can make sense to
establish a dedicated customer success team that fully focuses on activation,
upselling, and cross-selling, not on a 1:1 level, but rather on a 1:many level
(e.g. via webinars, academy content, etc.)
