Today we cover the topic of how to follow up after your sales meetings.

I will share with you a template for each stage of the sales process, from
initial contact to discovery to disco-demo and demo.

And don’t forget to send these follow-up emails as fast as possible after the
meetings, not later than 24 hours after the meeting.

P.S. If you send follow-up emails at all, you’re doing better than most others
:)

There’s a variety of initial touchpoints. This can be that you meet a prospect
at a fair, an event, or just through a cold call.

The email consists of 5 sections:

1️⃣ **Email Opener**

2️⃣ **Observation / Recap**

3️⃣ **Value Proposition**

4️⃣ **Next steps / CTA**

5️⃣ **P.S. (aka. soft CTA)**

If you follow my content for a while, you will see that the {custom variables}
are also key elements of:

✅ [Sales Discovery Framework](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/sales-
discovery-101-case-studies) (e.g. SPIN, SUGAR, SPICED, MEDDIC)

✅ [SaaS Messaging Framework](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-
messaging-framework)

This is how you translate a strong GTM foundation into operational assets. In
this case your email templates.

But the same is true for your [sales deck](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-
perfect-sales-deck-template) or your [SaaS
homepage](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/how-to-high-converting-saas-homepage).

After your discovery call, it’s key to follow up and summarize:

✅ the observation you made about the status quo, pains, and desired outcomes

✅ high-level value proposition/pitch

✅ agreed next steps

The email comes with 6 sections:

1️⃣ **Email opener**

2️⃣ **Recap discovery**

\--> Describe the status quo

\--> mention the discovery of pain

\--> Add the desired goal/outcome

3️⃣ **Value Proposition**

\--> Remind them about what you do

\--> for who you are ([ICP](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-
customer-profile))

\--> What benefits they have

\--> social proof

Please don't go into details. No feature lists.

4️⃣ **Call out of blockers/objections**

\--> Adress potential blockers proactively

This can be specific questions about the product, e.g. features or
integrations.

Or more budget-related. ROI calculations.

Or social proof like case studies.

5️⃣ **Next steps**

\--> Talk about the mutually agreed roadmap.

Usually, this includes a scheduled demo + who will join (stakeholders).

6️⃣ **P. S Section / Secondary CTA**

\--> add additional relevant info here

This can be a case study, a short video, or documentation.

Quick reminder. Disco-demo call is when you have a 1-step sales process. This
means in your first call you’re doing discovery and demo. More common is a
2-step sales process where you have a dedicated discovery call and a dedicated
product demo.

You will see that this email contains elements of the post-discovery email,
plus elements of the post-demo email (coming below).

This makes a lot of sense, as the disco-demo is a blended version of both 😇.

The post-demo email is one of the most important emails in the sales process.

I wrote a [previous newsletter about this
email](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-sales-demo-follow-up-email-template).
It goes into the details about the recipients, the structure, the email body,
and the subject line.

The actual email template is very similar to the one from today. But since I
wrote the previous newsletter I worked with lots of new SaaS founders, and now
I present the V2 of the demo follow-up email 👇

The 6 key sections are

1️⃣ **Email opener**

2️⃣ **Recap of all discovery insights**

\--> Describe the status quo

\--> the pain (& ideally negative implications)

\--> Add the desired goal/outcome

3️⃣ **Value Proposition** (for them)

\--> Summarize how your product (capabilities & features) help them to fix
their pain.

\--> add social proof

Keep this part personalized. Focus on what’s important for them. No feature
lists.

4️⃣ **Call out of blockers/objections**

\--> Adress potential blockers proactively

This can be specific questions about the product, e.g. features or
integrations.

Or more budget-related. ROI calculations.

Or social proof like case studies.

5️⃣ **Next steps**

\--> Talk about the mutually agreed roadmap.

6️⃣ **P. S Section / Secondary CTA**

\--> add additional relevant info here

This can be a case study, a short video, or documentation.
