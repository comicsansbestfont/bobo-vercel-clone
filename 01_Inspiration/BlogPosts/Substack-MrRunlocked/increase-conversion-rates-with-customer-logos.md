Adding customer logos to your pricing table will increase your conversion.

It’s easy to implement but can positively impact your business.  

Logos are a great way to add social proof. You can add on each pricing plan:  

🔸 2-3 logos/names that use this plan  

🔸 add 'used by' or 'Helps companies like...'  

Doing so will help your visitors to know which plan is right for them.  

Because either they know that they are similar to the ones mentioned, or they
want to be like them.

Another great conversation rate experiment is done by Personio.

I've tried to sign up for
[Personio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/personio/) and experienced a nice
conversion hack.  

Instead of the usual sign-up page, I found a sign-up modal over the 'product
UI'.  

It created a feeling of:  

🔸 it's the final step  

🔸 this is the product, I want to test now  

The modal is a nice teaser of the actual product.

Don’t know about exact numbers, but I’m sure it has a positive impact on
conversation rates.

You will burn lots of cash if you’re running paid ads without ICP (Ideal
Customer Profile).

A few reasons why they don’t perform:

❌ no/wrong understanding about the right keywords

❌ bad messaging (on ads)

❌ low conversion rates (because your website messaging is off)

❌ low activation rates (bad fit leads or low conversions because of bad
messaging)

Without knowing your ICP and seeing good results in at least one other
channel, I would NOT do paid ads.

**So if you want to find your ICP, here are 6 ways to find them.**

And if you are early and don’t have customers to analyze, getting a good
understanding of your market is key.

**Here are 4 ways to learn about your MARKET.**  

1️⃣ Interviews / Discovery Calls  
\--> reach out to potential customers and talk about the usecases to learn
about potential problems with the status quo  

2️⃣ Expert Interviews  
\--> reach out to experts of the industry and learn from them  

3️⃣ Desk research  
\--> Search online for trends, reports, and statistics about the market.
Communities can be also a very powerful source.  

4️⃣ Competitor Content  
\--> Check the websites of your direct & indirect competitors. Their content
can contain very useful information (blog, newsletter, social posts...)
