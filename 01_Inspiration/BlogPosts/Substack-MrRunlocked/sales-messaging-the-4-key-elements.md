The 2 main reasons why you can’t sell your product are:

  1. You’re building a product that does not really solve a problem —> no one needs it (really)!

  2. Your messaging is off —> no one will discover and test the product, even if it’s good!

I would even say without message-market fit it’s hard to achieve product-
market fit.

> Because no message market fit —> no meetings —> no users/customers —> no
> product feedback —> no PMF (product market fit).

So having powerful messaging is essential for the success of your business.

Messaging plays a crucial role in all your [growth
channels](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/12-powerful-b2b-saas-
channels-for) \- but especially for your outbound sales motion.

Only if you combine all 4, you will book more meetings, or get more sign-ups.

1️⃣ **The right leads.**

It is all about your [ideal customer profile
(ICP](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-powerful-
ideal-customer))(Make sure to check out the [2 parts of a powerful
ICP](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-2-parts-of-a-powerful-
ideal-customer)). You need to know who they are.

Make sure you have clear written down answers on:

🔶 their roles

🔶 the responsibilities

🔶 their status quo (how they do things right now)

🔶 the problem/challenge they (normally) have

🔶 the dream situation

🔶 what's holding them back

Once you know who they are, you can start to create lists and build segments.
This way you can write powerful messages that resonate with them.

2️⃣ **The timing**

The problem you are solving for them needs to be urgent.

Otherwise, you are not on their priority list. Or maybe priority no. 50.

Which means you will not close the deal.

A great tactic is to make use of [trigger
events](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-2-parts-of-a-powerful-
ideal-customer) (they are awesome for email icebreakers) & lead qualifications
(like SUGAR).

3️⃣ **The channel**

You need to meet your prospects where they are.

If you are active on Twitter, but your ICP doesn't even know what this is, you
will not book any meetings.

A clearly defined ICP also includes what channel they hang out on and the best
way to engage with them.

\--> Test different channels to see what works

4️⃣ **The messaging**

Do you understand your ICP?

And know their pain points?

Can you provide value and insights?

Do you speak the same language?

In the end, copywriting is simple if you know who your ICP is, what
problems/pains/challenges they have, and what they care about (their goals,
aspirations etc.)

That’s why I highly recommend creating your own messaging framework.

It includes messaging elements that you can copy&paste on the different
‘channels’ like email, website, sales demos etc.

🔶 Personas & Companies

🔶 Status Quo

🔶 Pain Points

🔶 Desired State

🔶 Objections

🔶 Your Product Type

🔶 New Capabilities

🔶 Top 3 Killer Features

🔶 Benefits

🔶 Social Proof/Trust

🔶 Alternatives

So now you know the 4 key elements of a powerful sales message.

Let’s see what steps you need to follow to write powerful outbound sales
sequences.

Follow these steps to create cold emails that stand out and generate results
for your B2B SaaS company!

First, you need a list of prospects. Focus on prospects that belong to your
ICP.

Find databases where you find your ICP. Most probably Linkedin Sales Navigator
can help.

But there are many more sources you can use. Build lists/segments of around 50
with similar criteria. This way you can build highly targeted campaigns.

Once you created a list of leads, you need to get their emails.

There are many tools like [hunter](https://hunter.io/?via=alex-notion),
[evaboot](https://evaboot.com/),
[findymail](https://findymail.com?via=startupbusinesstips),
[lusha](https://www.lusha.com/) or
[dropcontact](https://www.dropcontact.com/).

Make sure to only use validated emails - otherwise, you will see high bounce
rates.

That's when you add more info to each lead that allows you to send relevant
and personalized emails.

[Trigger events or
Icebreakers](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-2-parts-of-a-
powerful-ideal-customer) are your friends.

The best ways to find relevant information are Linkedin profiles (personal and
company pages) and company websites. It could also make sense to find further
info on websites like Crunchbase, Capterra, Kununu etc.

Now you have a list of relevant prospects with relevant info you can use to
write personalized emails (at scale).

Prospects normally need more than one touchpoint to take action. So run
campaigns with 3-7 steps.

Great tools to do this efficiently are [Lemlist](https://www.lemlist.com/) or
[Lagrowthmachine](https://lagrowthmachine.com/) \- they even allow you to go
multichannel mixing email, LinkedIn, and calls in your campaign.

Now you have a list of relevant prospects and build a multi-step campaign.

So now you need to actually write the messages (emails and Linkedin DMs).

Here are some specific tips:

**💥 Add personalization with icebreakers💥**

Personalization doesn’t mean writing completely individualized emails per
prospect.

Individualization is not scalable, but personalization is scalable.

As long as you build a list of prospects that share the same problems, you can
use the same body of the email - and add personalization with custom
variables.

Check out the [TAPSA
framework](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/cold-email-template).

**💥 Structure is key 💥**

Keep the message short.

  * Short sentences.

  * 3 to max. 4 paragraphs with 2-3 sentences max.

  * New lines to make it easier to read.

  * Add a clear CTA to make it easy for them to move forward.

**💥 Make it clear what you want (CTA) 💥**

Always have a CTA in your message. There are 2 types of CTAs. The interest-
based CTAs (soft) and the specific CTA (hard).

Interest-based CTAs ask open questions like

>  _How do you currently face XYZ?_ or _Is XYZ currently a priority for you?_

Specific CTAs ask for a specific action like

> Are you free for a quick call next week?

Most of the time soft interest-based CTAs perform better.

**💥 Use the P.S. section 💥**

The P.S and the first sentence of your email are the most read sections.

Because most people just skim your email. It's great to deliver some value
(e.g. share a free resource with them).

The [TAPSA framework](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/cold-email-
template) basically applies the rules of the famous PAS framework.

It's a highly effective framework for powerful copywriting and messaging.

You can make use of the PAS Framework for all different copywriting
challenges:

🔶 website copy

🔶 sales presentations

🔶 email marketing

🔶 landing pages

🔶 elevator pitches

🔶 your ads

PAS stands for:

**1️⃣ Problem**

Lead with the problem.

The problem needs to be specific. Being specific guarantees that the recipient
feels ‘Hmm, true. I also have this problem, let’s read on…maybe it’s
interesting for me’

Example: _Scheduling calls with clients and partners is a lot of emails back
and forth. Takes 10 minutes per meeting..._

**2️⃣ Agitate**

Once you get the attention, your job is to go deeper to show that you really
understand them.

Make the problem more emotional, tangible, and scary...

You need to highlight what it means to have this problem (how much it hurts).

Now you have their attention. They know how much it ‘hurts’.

Now you can pitch your ‘painkiller’.

Example: _It takes you 3-4 emails to find a suitable time for both, and 1 out
of 4 meetings are getting postponed last minute. Sometimes you're just bored
with scheduling new meetings, but you know it's important to hit your sales
quota._

3️⃣ **Solution**

Show them that you have something that fixes their problem (your pain killer).

Example: _Simply send a shareable link to your calendar and let prospects book
a suitable time in your calendar. Save time for both parties. Focus on more
important tasks._

P.S. It sounds like Calendly.

**Tip: How to hire the right salespeople**

Are you in the market for top sales talent to help drive the success of your
SaaS business?

Here are some tips to help you identify and hire the best salespeople:

🔍 Look for relevant experience: Focus on candidates who have experience
selling similar deal sizes and technology with similar complexity. Also, look
for someone who is mission-oriented and cares about your company's vision.

💪 Assess their sales skills: Use The Challenger Sale methodology to assess a
candidate's sales skills. Look for candidates who possess the five key skills
of teaching, tailoring, taking control, commercial insight, and building
relationships.

📈 Look for a drive to self-improvement: Look for those who are competitive
with themselves and constantly strive to improve their own performance.

Now that you know what to look for in a top-performing salesperson, where do
you find them? Here are a few places to start:

🔎 LinkedIn: Use LinkedIn to search for candidates with relevant experience and
see if they have any endorsements or recommendations from past colleagues.

👥 Referrals: Reach out to your network and ask for referrals. Referrals can be
especially valuable because they often come from people who know the candidate
personally and can vouch for their skills and work ethic.

💻 Online job boards: Use online job boards like Indeed or Glassdoor to post
job openings and search for candidates with relevant experience and
qualifications.
