Founders, especially early-stage ones, know that having as many potential user
conversations as possible is key to success.

Social listening – tracking and engaging with relevant conversations online –
can, therefore, be a great lever for growth.

From high-intent mentions (those signals that someone needs a solution like
yours), founders can win new customers, inform product decisions, and build
awareness without a big marketing budget.

Today, we will break down how to leverage social listening to grow your SaaS
with best practices you can implement right now.

We will go over:

  1. What is social listening

  2. Real examples of B2B SaaS using Social Listening to grow

  3. How to Monitor for High-Intent Mentions

  4. How to engage successfully & leverage insights

Social listening is the process of monitoring online conversations about your
brand, product, and industry, usually via**tracking certain keywords**. You
can then analyze those discussions for insights and act on opportunities.

In a B2B SaaS context, it means keeping an ear to the ground where your target
users discuss (X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Reddit, Slack communities, etc.).

It’s about understanding pain points, spotting trends, and jumping in when
someone [signals a need](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/allbound-playbooks) you
can fulfill.

For early-stage SaaS companies, social listening can be an efficient growth
tool.

Why? Because in the 0-1M ARR stage,

❌ You likely don’t have a huge brand presence or a big budget for[
ads](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/google-ads-guide).

✅ You do, however, have the agility to personally engage with users and adapt
quickly.

Social listening lets you:

**1️⃣ Discover early leads** – You can find people actively asking for the
solution you offer or complaining about a competitor, and get on their radar
organically.

**2️⃣ Get unfiltered feedback** – People are often brutally honest on social
media and forums (cough cough Reddit). This feedback is gold for refining your
product and [messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-
messaging-framework).

**3️⃣ Build brand awareness** – By participating in conversations, you start
to be seen as part of the community, not just an ad in the sidebar. This
[builds trust](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/guide-case-studies) and awareness
step by step.

**4️⃣ Inform strategy** – Patterns in discussions can reveal what features
users care about, what language they use, where they spend their time, and how
they compare options, guiding your product roadmap and marketing strategy.

**5️⃣ Collect testimonials** \- Organic mentions of your product are a great
way to collect first testimonials (especially if you’re PLG). We wrote a [full
guide on how to collect case studies and
testimonials](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/159973018/organic-mentions) in a
previous episode.

It’s easy to confuse **social listening** with **brand monitoring** – they are
related:

  * **Brand monitoring** is tracking and responding to direct mentions of your brand or product. It’s like customer service on social media. For example, if someone tags your X handle to report a bug or ask a question, you respond. It’s crucial, especially for bigger brands that get mentioned a lot, but less so if you are just starting.

  * **Social listening** involves **tracking broader conversations** beyond those where you’re mentioned. **It’s proactive** – you’re looking at what people say about the problem you solve, the pain points in your industry, and discussions about competitors or related topics. The goal is to understand your audience and jump on opportunities.

Think of it this way: if someone tweets

“Any recommendations for an affordable form builder?”

An early-stage SaaS founder practicing social listening can catch that tweet
(even though their product wasn’t mentioned) and see a potential customer
asking for help.

Let’s look at how real companies have leveraged social listening to drive
growth, improve their product, and find their first customers.

[Tally](http://tally.so), a popular bootstrapped form-building SaaS, is a
great example of an early-stage company that used social listening to grow.
Tally recently made waves for reaching 2M in ARR with just a team of 5 and
completely bootstrapped.

Co-founder Marie Martens has said that [social listening became one of the
best marketing hacks](https://2quiet2market.com/blog/trm-e07-use-social-
listening-to-simplify-your-marketing-marie-martens/) she used. Instead of paid
advertising, she spent time scanning online conversations about form builders
[on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and
Quora](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/152654955/communities).

Whenever she spotted someone asking for a form tool recommendation or
complaining about the limitations of Google Forms/Typeform, Marie would come
in with a helpful answer.

Often, that included mentioning Tally as an option – but crucially, in a way
that felt natural and not salesy.

Someone looks for a form-building tool that has this feature.

You can just say👇

“Hey, I’m building this, feel free to try it out.”

It works because it’s relevant. It’s not pushy, it doesn’t feel like you’re
doing marketing – you’re just, as a founder, sharing your product.”

media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5199704f-6d49-41a8-8fed-5ad3986a18bd_1472x306.png)
_**Example: Marie jumps in when people ask for a “Typeform alternative”**_

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gXzv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-

_**Example: Marie presents tally when someone asks for a “Free “contact us”
Forms”**_

Importantly, Tally’s team didn’t just hunt for potential customers – they also
listened for feedback and ideas. By reading these user questions and
discussions, you see:

  * The pain points your audience struggles with

  * What people are searching for

  * What your own product currently lacks

  * What competitors are being mentioned, and how

  * Where your target audience hangs out

To streamline this process, the Tally team set up a dedicated Slack channel
pumping in social mentions in real-time. These mentions were found by tracking
keywords with a social listening tool like “form-builder”, “google forms”,
“typefully”.

Tally’s story shows how early-stage founders can use social listening as a
multiplier: every question answered was not just one potential signup but also
content inspiration and feedback.

[Documenso](https://documenso.com/) is an open-source alternative to well-
known signing tools like DocuSign and DocSend founded by Timur Ercan.

One of their strategies for growth: monitor social media for conversations
where people explicitly say they’re unhappy with DocuSign or other bigger
incumbents e.g., “looking for a DocuSign alternative.”

Or those who are on the hunt for open-source offerings.

These are high-intent signals.

For example, the team kept an eye on:

That way Documenso could make sure their name is in the mix. By jumping into
those threads with helpful info, they managed to capture the attention of
exactly the kind of user who would value their product.

The types of posts relevant to Documenso:

Documenso’s team also engaged with the broader open-source and dev communities
on platforms like Hacker News, GitHub, Product Hunt, and dedicated Slack
communities.

Creator of Dev Marketing Slack community, Flo Merian noted that being
transparent and sharing progress publicly helped attract users for Documenso;
whenever they saw threads about open-source software or digital signing
solutions, they “[got involved” in the conversation and linked back to their
project on GitHub](https://posthog.com/spotlight/startup-
documenso#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20try%20to%20be%20as,%E2%80%9D).

This not only drove traffic and stars to their repository (growing social
proof), but also funneled interested developers into their user base.

**The key lessons here:**

1\. if your startup is up against big competitors, tune into the conversations
where the discontent or needs around those competitors are expressed.

2\. Find out specifically where YOUR audience hangs out to join the
conversation;, this will be different for DevTool audiences vs. something like
HR or Design professionals.

[Octolens](https://octolens.com/?via=alexander) is the AI social listening
tool that co-founder Charlotte Schmitt founded.

It tracks keywords across socials continuously and notifies you when high-
value posts come up (e.g., posts with buy-intent or customer complaints).

Since its first days, Octolens has used Octolens to grow. Dogfooding your own
SaaS comes with many benefits, and luckily, in our case, that includes
customer acquisition.

The keywords we use to grow are a mix of competitors, industry terms, and our
own brand.

Social listening is not a novel field, so there are several incumbents worth
tracking. These include, for example:

Here are a few of the posts in our Octolens feed for the keyword Google
Alerts, all people complaining about the tool. All opportunities to plug
Octolens as an alternative.

Tracking industry terms like “social listening”, “keyword tracking”, and
“brand monitoring” also helps surface high buy-intent posts. For example:

Every morning, Charlotte goes through her daily roundup email to see if
anything interesting has happened since ending work the day before.

On top of that, for any new mentions during the day, she gets slack
notifications delivered so she can act fast.

So, how do you do social listening in practice? It boils down to these 4
steps:

  1. **Identify key channels** where your audience and industry peers are most active (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Reddit, Hacker News).

  2. **Define the keywords** you need to track—brand names, product names, competitor names, and specific pain points.

  3. **Monitoring your channels** either with a social listening tool or manually to find relevant conversations based on the keywords.

  4. **Take action** , for example, to respond quickly and thoughtfully to mentions that matter (both positive and negative) or learn from current sentiment to apply to your business (e.g., add a new feature).

Your potential customers hang out in more places than you might initially
think. Here are some of the top platforms and channels to monitor for B2B
SaaS-related conversations:

  * **Twitter (X)** – People often ask for tool recommendations or vent about products on Twitter. Search for keywords and hashtags related to your space (e.g. #emailmarketing or “CRM recommendation”). Many founders have found leads by replying to tweets like “Looking for a better solution than X, any ideas?”. Twitter’s advanced search lets you define things like exact match, AND/OR operators, and language.

  * **LinkedIn** – On LinkedIn, conversations are a bit more formal but very valuable for B2B. Monitor posts from your network or in relevant groups where people discuss vendors, tools, or industry pain points. A VP might post “We’re struggling with our onboarding process – what’s everyone using for user analytics?” That’s a huge opportunity if you have an analytics SaaS. Use LinkedIn search for recent posts and also watch comment sections on influencers’ posts – lots of insights and questions pop up there.

  * **Reddit** – there’s a subreddit for nearly every niche. Find the subreddits where your target users hang out. For example, r/SaaS, r/startups, or tech-specific ones like r/analytics, r/marketingautomation, r/selfhosted (for open-source alternatives) etc. People on Reddit frequently ask for product recommendations or help (“How do I do X?” or “Best alternative to Y?”). Use Reddit’s search or tools like F5bot to get alerts for keywords (F5bot will email you whenever your chosen keywords are mentioned on Reddit – super handy for a free tool).

  * **Slack & Discord Communities** – Many industries have private or semi-private communities on Slack or Discord servers where professionals exchange. For example, there might be a Slack group for UX designers or a Discord for indie hackers. Join the ones relevant to your audience. While you can’t automatically monitor these as easily (since they’re closed environments), being an active member and using the internal search is key. Once in, start by adding value in the community first and then keep an eye on new messages. Some Slack communities also have announcement channels where people ask for tool suggestions – watch those.

  * **Forums & Q&A Sites** – Don’t ignore places like Quora, Stack Overflow (for dev tools), or industry-specific forums. Quora has tons of questions like “What’s the best software for X?” which are literally someone asking for a solution. Niche forums (such as a community on GrowthHackers for marketing tech, or Spiceworks for IT software) can also have valuable chatter. If there’s a forum for your vertical, consider making it part of your routine.

  * **Product Hunt / Hacker News** – When someone is actively searching for new tools, they might browse Product Hunt or post on Hacker News (“Ask HN: Looking for a X solution that does Y”). Keep an eye on those “Ask HN” posts or discussions about competitors on HN. Product Hunt comments can also reveal early user impressions or needs. While these are more sporadic, they’re high intent when they happen.

  * **Bluesky:** A newer, decentralized social platform gaining momentum among early adopters and tech enthusiasts. Could be a hidden goldmine for forward-looking SaaS founders - a lot of people have been migrating from X to Bluesky, so you’ll want to cover both.

  * **YouTube:** With over two billion logged-in users each month, YouTube isn’t just for entertainment—it’s a massive hub for product demos, tutorials, and thought leadership content. B2B SaaS founders can showcase how their software works in real-world scenarios, while prospects often watch “how-to” videos and unbiased reviews before making buying decisions.

Depending on your niche, you may also want to focus on Facebook groups,
TikTok, or Instagram, however, those tend to be more relevant for B2C
companies.

In short, go wherever your target customers ask questions or share opinions
online. Make a list of these platforms.

To start, pick the top 2-3 where you suspect the highest activity (commonly
Twitter, Reddit, and one other, like LinkedIn or a forum). You can always
expand later.

Once you know where to listen, the next step is deciding what to listen for
and setting up a system to do it continuously. Here’s how to set up your
keyword and brand monitoring:

Start with a list of terms to track. These typically include:

  1. **Your brand name** \- and your social handles, you won’t want to miss any posts that mention your brand directly. If your brand name is a common word, include some context (e.g. track “Notion.so” or “@notionHQ” instead of “Notion”) or some additional terms (e.g., a post needs to include “Juicebox” AND “AI”). You might even consider tracking some common misspellings, e.g. “Hubspot” vs “HubSpot”.

  2. **Your product’s category** – think like a user who doesn’t know your brand. For example, Tally might track “form builder” or “online form tool”. Documenso tracks “e-signature tool” or “signing software”. Include variations and related terms. A tool like Attio or Pipedrive might search for “CRM tool” or “SaaS CRM”. Companies like Monday.com or Asana may track words like “project management software” and “work management platform”.

  3. **Competitor names** – list your direct competitors and even adjacent solutions. If people mention them, you want to know (could be an opportunity if they’re unhappy or looking around).

  4. **Pain point phrases** – things your target user might say when experiencing the problem your SaaS solves. E.g., if you have a server monitoring SaaS, track phrases like “server downtime alert” or “monitoring our servers”. Or “high SaaS CACs”, “high churn rate” or “slow sales cycle” if your product helps fix those pain points. These can lead you to discussions where your solution is relevant.

  5. **Buying intent triggers** – words like “recommendation, alternative, vs, choosing, looking for, anyone use...” combined with category terms. For example, “recommend CRM” or “alternative to Salesforce”.

  6. **Industry terms -** words that are used a lot by your ICP and allow you to start a meaningful discussion on social. Example: “MRR reporting” (for SaaS industry, e.g. if you’re a financial tool for SaaS companies) or ‘cart abandonment rate’ (for e-commerce)

Once you have your platforms and keywords, it’s about consistently monitoring
and jumping on opportunities.

The most basic way to do it is manually. It’s also the most time-consuming
approach, but a good way to get into the habit and get started.

In this case, block a recurring time in your calendar and go through the
platforms and keywords you have identified one by one. Prioritize answering
high-intent mentions fast.

To help refine your searches, you can make use of advanced search settings
where possible. e.g., Boolean operators – Search for “data drift” AND “AI” to
filter only for posts that contain both keywords. This is available on most
platforms.

Another example, “Vercel” and “AI” on twitter:

Check out these resources for using Boolean searches on
[LInkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a524335), advanced
searches on [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/search-advanced?), and
[Reddit](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-
us/articles/19696541895316-Available-search-features).

The problem with manual tracking is that you’ll often miss timely mentions,
and either the author has already gotten what they were looking for from
someone else, or it's not a top priority anymore.

This is where social listening tools can be handy. There are a few you can
consider as an early-stage SaaS:

  * [Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts) (free) – Set up alerts for key terms to track mentions across blogs, news sites, and forums. While not real-time, it’s useful for catching broader industry discussions. It won’t get most social mentions though and has a lot of noise.

  * [F5bot](https://f5bot.com/) (free) – Get email alerts for mentions of your keywords on Reddit and Hacker News.

  * [Octolens](https://octolens.com/?via=alexander) (paid) – Octolens (disclaimer, Charlotte, the co-author, is the founder) is built for B2B SaaS in mind and uses AI to help filter out the noise and bring to the forefront buy-intent and other high-value mentions on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn, forums, and more. Get email, slack, or webhook alerts for important mentions so you can react fast.

  * [Brand24](https://brand24.com/) or [Mention](https://mention.com/en/) (paid) – Another option is Brand24 or Mention, they are slightly more upmarket and also cover some more platforms relevant outside of B2B.

  * [Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com/) or [Hootsuite](https://www.hootsuite.com/) (paid) – These are the really big ones that are more like social media marketing suites with analytics and scheduling as part of the offer. These are more relevant for enterprise customers and agencies.

A tool will do this for you, but even if you are tracking keywords manually,
it’s important to keep track of high-value mentions somewhere. For example, in
a Slack channel or a Google sheet.

That way, you can see patterns in what types of keywords people use in
mentions with high buy intent or those where you can draw insights from. For
example, if you are seeing negative feedback about competitors, you should
respond, but you should also log that information to use it in the future.

You’ll also be able to refine what kind of keywords you are searching for in
your daily routine to be able to refine.

If you do have a bit of budget for a tool and want to cut out hours of manual
repetitive work, here’s a quick overview of how
[Octolens](https://octolens.com/?via=alexander) helps you find high-intent
mentions on autopilot:

1\. Sign up for a [free trial](https://octolens.com/?via=alexander).

2\. Complete onboarding by adding your URL, Octolens uses AI to research your
company and suggests keywords (a mix of brand name, competitors, and industry
terms) which you can edit or add to later.

3\. Your feed will populate with AI-ranked posts (high-buy intent will always
be marked as high), and from now on will update with new ones coming up across
all B2B SaaS relevant platforms like X, LinkedIn, Reddit, Bluesky, Hacker
News, and co.

4\. Set up notifications where you like to receive them: Email, Slack, or via
Webhooks

E.g., Octolens Slack notifications for high-relevance mentions.

5\. Engage and grow!

When you get an alert for a high-relevance mention, react fast!

Regardless of whether it's manual or with a tool like Octolens, the next
section will show you how you engage effectively with high-intent mentions to
grow.

Once you identify high-intent discussions, the next step is to engage
effectively to try and win customers or nurture the lead. Here’s how to do it
without sounding spammy.

Instead of immediately pitching your product, contribute meaningfully to the
conversation.

→ Check out how to do [‘value comments’ on
LinkedIn](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/148840640/value-commenting-on-icp-
relevant-creators)

If you’re the founder, say so—it builds credibility.

If someone shows interest, follow up in a helpful way or address any
problems/questions that come up. You can also offer an extended free trial,
share use cases, or invite them to a private chat or call.

Some discussions, especially on Reddit or LinkedIn, are better moved to
private messages. A good approach: “Happy to share more details—DM me if you’d
like a walkthrough.”

Or if you’d like to reshare content, whether it's positive endorsements or
complaints about competitors, follow up with a DM to ask for permission.
Distributing UGC or relevant content is a valuable perk of social listening.

Beyond direct customer acquisition, social listening can also help you with
the following:

  1. **Turn Insights into Content**

If many people talk about specific things over and over again on social, you
can create [dedicated content](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-
content-marketing-guide) (e.g. LinkedIn posts or Blog posts) for this topic.

  2. **Improve Product Messaging and Positioning**

Adopt user language – If people call your category “workflow automation”
instead of “task management,” use their wording in your marketing.

Highlight the right pain points – If competitors’ pricing keeps coming up as a
frustration, emphasize affordability in your
[messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-
framework).

Address objections upfront – If users think your tool lacks integrations,
proactively clarify what’s available.

  3. **Optimize Your Product Based on User Needs**

Track feature requests and prioritize development based on what users ask for.

Identify and fix common UX frustrations users mention in public conversations
(including what they don’t love about the competition).

Engage power users by inviting them to beta test new features.

Charlotte and the Octolens team have seen them all.

Over +1,000 founders and GTM team members using Octolens, so she learned a lot
about what not to do.

Here are 6 common social listening mistakes founders and GTM teams make and
how to avoid them.

**❌ Mistake #1: Going Straight for the Sale**

  *  _Problem:_ Coming across as spammy by dropping a product link with zero context.

  * _Fix:_ Provide a thoughtful response or tip first, then naturally ‘promote’ your product.

**❌ Mistake #2: Not Disclosing Founder/Employee Role**

  *  _Problem:_ People value transparency, especially on Reddit.

  * _Fix:_ State who you are and why you’re recommending your own product or solution.

**❌ Mistake #3: Not Tracking the Right Keywords**

  *  _Problem:_ Missing out on high-intent threads or overloading on irrelevant topics.

  * _Fix:_ Monitor competitor names, key pain points, product categories & multiple variations of your brand name.

**❌ Mistake #4: Using AI-Generated Answers Without a Personal Touch**

**❌ Mistake #5: Focusing Solely on LinkedIn**

  *  _Problem:_ Overlooking potentially valuable discussions on Reddit, Twitter/X, Hacker News, and smaller communities.

  * _Fix:_ Employ a cross-platform monitoring strategy (manual or via a tool like Octolens).

**❌ Mistake #6: Being Inconsistent**

Social listening is an underutilized growth tactic for early-stage SaaS
founders.

You create a compounding effect that drives both customer acquisition and
product-market fit by tracking high-intent mentions, engaging authentically,
and using insights to refine your product and messaging.

Happy growth 🚀
