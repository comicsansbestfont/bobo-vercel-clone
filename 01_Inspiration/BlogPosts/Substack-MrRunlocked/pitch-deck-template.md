Hey - it’s Alex, this time together with pitch deck expert [Majd
Alaily](https://www.linkedin.com/in/majdalaily/)!

In one of the recent episodes of MRR Unlocked, we wrote a guide on [how to
secure your funding in 2026](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/first-investment-
guide).****

Given that all of you really found value in that episode, and knowing that how
to create a [powerful sales deck](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/high-
converting-sales-deck) was one of the best episodes so far, I’ve come up with
another topic that will help you with your fundraising:

👉 **How to Create the Perfect Pitch Deck**

So I asked Majd to share his best tips with you.

This episode is written by Majd from his own experience in working with
startups. Hope you find great value in it!

I’ve worked in sales at Google for 10 years, and been a founder for 4. And
honestly? I’m tired of seeing terrible pitches.

This year alone, I’ve sat through over 100 pitches online, Zoom, demo days, or
what have you.

And it’s always the SAME thing.

The founder comes on stage and manages in 10 minutes to completely lose you
and the rest of the audience.

What happens?

As a founder, you know a LOT about your startup. You’ve lived and breathed
this business, day in and day out, for perhaps years.

Sub-consciously, you assume you need to bring up the audience to your level.

Problem is… you’ve got 10 minutes, and your baseline is zero.

And so you go in with the dreaded “information dump”.

And then you get surprised [why no one is investing in
you](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/majdalaily_this-might-hurt-theres-a-
reason-vcs-arent-
activity-7376163437426413568-Cicr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAFZDoYB4NNSVa-
fVRzS43Blv_bAjSzrUcE).

**Information asymmetry**.

You know so much about your business. And I know so little.

It’s not a smart strategy to try to get me to your level in our first meeting,
let alone in 10 minutes.

What you need is to give me the [Minimal Viable Information
needed](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/majdalaily_are-you-getting-rejected-by-
investors-your-activity-7317811460854661120-6mox/) for me to say

> _“I get it. This is cool. Let’s book a second meeting.”_

Second meetings lead to thirds; thirds lead to checks.

After seeing 1,000+ pitches in my career, I’ve distilled everything I know
about an amazing first pitch into this framework. I’ve also linked to bonus
readings that can help you explore every topic in more detail.

Steal it with pride to build an AWESOME first pitch.

  1. **Problem**

One sentence that makes the pain feel _urgent_ and _frequent_.  
I need to leave thinking: “wow, this problem is huge, (and I had no idea)”

  2. **Solution**

Your clean answer to that pain (1–2 tight lines). No buzzword soup.  

👉 Bonus: [Perfect your elevator pitch
here.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/majdalaily_want-an-epic-elevator-pitch-
that-gets-activity-7303331043489517569-iix_/)

  3. **Unique Value (USPs)**

2–3 reasons you win (at least one technical edge).  
_Think:_ data advantage, distribution wedge, speed/cost delta, technology
usage or more.

  4. **Traction**

Proof people want it. Even pre-revenue, you can show signals.  
_Good signals:_ REVENUE first. If not, look for retention, WAU/MAU, waitlist,
organic %, cohort usage, time-to-value.  

👉 Bonus: [Here’s what you can show if you are pre-
revenue.](https://majdalaily.substack.com/p/win-investor-trust-without-a-
dollar)

  5. **Competition**

Who else solves it, and why you win.  
Don’t say “we have no competition.” You lose all your credibility.  

👉 Bonus: [How I know you have
competition](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/majdalaily_theres-a-thing-
founders-always-say-that-
activity-7376888201275322369-4s10?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAFZDoYB4NNSVa-
fVRzS43Blv_bAjSzrUcE).

  6. **Market**

Credible TAM/SAM/SOM.  
Big enough to matter, focused enough to enter.  

👉 Bonus: [Size your market properly with
this.](https://majdalaily.substack.com/p/how-to-size-your-market-without-
embarrassing)

  7. **Revenue Model**

How you make money, your pricing, and perhaps some early unit-econ sanity
(CAC, payback).  
_If you’re pre-revenue:_ show a fast path to first dollars (pilots, LOIs, pre-
orders).  

👉 Bonus: [How to monetize your
startup.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/majdalaily_if-youre-struggling-to-
monetize-your-startup-
activity-7373626801417338880-95fe?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAFZDoYB4NNSVa-
fVRzS43Blv_bAjSzrUcE)

  8. **Ambition (Vision + Projections)**

Where this goes in 3–5 years, grounded by sensible assumptions.  

  9. **Team**

Why _you_ are the ones that were born to build this.  
Highlight prior wins, domain edge, unfair insight.

  10. **Go-to-Market**

The growth engine (you’ve already built): How will you use funding to amplify
your success and grow the business?  

  11. **The Ask**

How much you’re raising, how much you’re selling, and your next steps.  
_Make the next step explicit:_ “Let’s schedule the diligence call; our data
room is ready.”

  1. Audit your current pitch: Can you tell the full story in just 11 slides?

  2. Optimize your skeleton: What should we add that’s missing? What’s extra that we should remove?

  3. Practice pitching to a “cold” audience: Get feedback from someone who knows nothing about your business.

  4. Cut the clutter: Focus only on what moves the conversation forward.

Don’t waste a great opportunity when you do get one.
