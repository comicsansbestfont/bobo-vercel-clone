After every [sales demo](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-
ultimate-guide-to-sales-product-demos) you should send a follow-up email to
your prospect. The ‘post demo’ email is probably the most important email in
your sales process (together with the [TAPSA cold
email](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-perfect-cold-email-
tapsa-framework)).

Okay, so let’s break the email down into the most important aspects.

  1. **The recipients**

Include all stakeholders that were part of the demo. If you have one main
contact person, send the email to him/her and add the others in CC.

  2. **Subject line**

Include the name of the company and your company. “Apple x Salesforce: Next
steps”

This makes it easy for everybody to find your emails in the inbox (easy to
search for), plus it’s personalized.

  3. **The email body**

Here it’s crucial to summarize the important things of the demo. Ideally, it
follows the structure of the template:

  * Summary of Status quo, pains/challenges and desired goal

  * Summary of capabilities and benefits (how your product helps them)

  * Additional material like case studies or testimonials

  * Answers to open questions

  * Next steps / mutual action plan

  4. **The structure**

As for every email, make sure it’s easy to read/scan. Short sentences and
paragraphs. Highlighting sections and important parts/words.

The first thing that I do when working with SaaS founders is to analyze the
current funnel. It gives me a clear understanding of what’s working and
especially on things that are not working. We quickly identify where we need
to focus on.

Here is a quick overview of how you identify where the problem exists in your
funnel and why you’re not growing (fast enough).

On a high level it’s always one (or more) of the following issues:

  * Acquisition problem (not getting enough leads)

  * Activation & Conversion problem (not winning enough leads to customers)

  * Retention problem (not keeping customers long enough).

**Let’s have a closer look how you can identify where your problem is 👇**

  1. **High churn rate (after paying for 1-2 months)**

A high churn rate of new paying customers is an indicator for:

  * Onboarding problem —> not fully onboarded, experiencing the value

  * Product problem (no product-market fit)

  2. **Low trial to paid conversion**

This means people trying your product, but you see only a few converting to
paying. It’s an indicator for:

  * Onboarding problem —> don’t experience the full value

  * Sales process —> hard to upgrade, not enough focus on ‘selling’

  * [Pricing](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-b2b-saas-pricing-guide) problem —> misalignment between product value and pricing

  3. **Low Deal win rate**

This means you have a lot of sales demos (deals), but only win a few customers
(low win rate). It’s an indicator for:

  4. **Low traffic to sign-up rate**

This means you get people on your website, but they don’t sign up (free trial
or demo). It’s an indicator for:

  5. **Low/no response to outbound messages (ads, cold emails, cold calls, etc.)**

This means you have a problem with:

  * [ICP](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile) problem—> they do not resonate with your messaging / value proposition

  * Messaging problem —> wrong messaging for ICP

  * Channel problem —> the channel is not the right one to convert your ICP

Once you know where to look, you can start to do a deeper analysis.
* * *

If your product is used by teams (not only in single-player mode), then you
should add an invitation email flow (to your onboarding flow).

No need to reinvent, look at what Slack does perfectly. Elena made an awesome
breakdown of the Slack invitation email.
