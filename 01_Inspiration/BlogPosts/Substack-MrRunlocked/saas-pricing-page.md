Your pricing page is one of the most important pages on your website. For many
visitors,

✅ It’s where interest converts to action, or  
❌ Where confusion sends them to a competitor.

Here’s the thing: people visiting your pricing page aren’t starting from zero.

They’ve likely seen dozens, if not hundreds, of SaaS pricing pages before.
They’ve compared your competitors. They know what information they’re looking
for and where they expect to find it.

(Please remind yourself of the [different stages of
awareness](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/147302979/step-map-your-stages-of-
awareness).)

This context is actually good news. It means you don’t need to reinvent the
wheel.

**The best pricing pages aren’t the most creative – they’re the clearest.**

They meet visitor expectations while providing enough context to help someone
confidently choose the right plan.

> Patrick Campbell, Founder of ProfitWell and pricing legend, used to say that
> visitors should be able to decide which plan is right for them within 30
> seconds.

That’s the benchmark. If it takes longer, you’re probably overcomplicating
things.

This guide breaks down the four essential sections every SaaS pricing page
needs:

1️⃣ Hero,  
2️⃣ Pricing Menu,  
3️⃣ Feature Comparison Table,  
4️⃣ FAQ.  

We’ll walk through what each section must include, common mistakes to avoid,
examples from companies doing it well, and optional sections to consider.

The goal isn’t to create the flashiest pricing page. It’s to create one that
clearly communicates value, eliminates confusion, and helps visitors take the
next step, whether that’s signing up for a free plan or scheduling a demo.

Let’s dive in.

The Hero section of the pricing page is what you see at the very top when you
visit. It’s important to remember that the hero section on a pricing page
isn’t the [hero section on your
homepage](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/146545088/step-transforming-messaging-
into-homepage-copy).  

The pricing page is typically more of a down-funnel visit. Meaning it is
primarily for someone closer to the consideration/purchasing stage, rather
than a first-time visitor who is just learning about your company.

Because of this, your pricing page does not need to be created for a first-
time visitor.

❌ You don’t need to give them a ton of information up at the top of the page.  
❌ You don’t need to tell them what your product does.

They probably already know that, and have a lot of context around it. Any
generic copy related to your company is unnecessary.

So instead, use the section to explain one or more of:

> 1️⃣ How can they start (for free) using your product
>
> 2️⃣ Why different types of customers might want different plans
>
> 3️⃣ How the product scales with them (being used by different types/sizes of
> companies)
>
> 4️⃣ What ‘more’ they get if they upgrade to a higher tier
>
> 5️⃣ Emphasizing USP in your pricing (for red ocean markets) → See livestorm
> example

That would make good value-add copy on your pricing page.

A good example here is Linear.

They don’t do anything fancy with the header, just Pricing.

Then, with the subheader, they provide context on how visitors can get started
and why they might want to upgrade. This tells visitors a few things.  

1️⃣ Linear offers a free plan.  
2️⃣ Issues as a metric is important to how pricing scales.  
3️⃣ Plans are differentiated by features.

Visitors can now dig into their pricing menu with those details in mind.

Another great way to use your pricing page hero is to communicate that you
don’t limit specific actions, especially if you operate in a crowded market
where your competitors limit product usage.

A great example is [Livestorm](https://livestorm.co/pricing). They highlight
“Unlimited licences. Unlimited events.”

It’s a great way to communicate how your pricing is different from your
(direct) competitors.

We also like how Clarify uses its Hero section. Highlighting that you don’t
pay for seats, instead for ‘outcome’.

The Pricing Menu is the most important section of a pricing page.

The goal of the Pricing Menu should be to communicate truly essential
information to visitors and to give them as much context as possible to
determine how they can work with you.

We see a lot of companies overload the Pricing Menu with exhaustive details,
and feel strongly that’s a mistake. One of the counterintuitive things about
pricing pages is that

**“The tighter your pricing menu, the more it looks as if you have really
thought through how to differentiate your plans.”**

✅ The goal of the pricing menu should be to show people the key levers and the
key differentiators between plans that might determine which one they’re a fit
for.

❌ The goal should not be to provide an exhaustive feature list that shows
every single differentiator and forces visitors to compare a bunch of numbers.

They can get that in the feature table. If you’re going to create a feature
comparison table anyway, then including all that information at the top is
redundant.

From the pricing menu, a visitor should be able to understand 6 core elements:

**1️⃣ Pricing Modality**

→ How you charge.

Options include Flat Fees (e.g. 50€/month), Licenses (e.g. 50€/month/user),
Usage-Based (e.g. 0,1€ per contact), Credits (e.g. 100€ for 1000 credits), or
a combination.

**2️⃣ Pricing Metrics (aka. value metric)**

→ The unit(s) you charge for (e.g., Users, GPUs, APIs, etc).

P.S. Learn how to [choose the right value
metric](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/134485840/step-choose-your-value-metric)
for your SaaS.

**3️⃣ Value Ladder (aka. feature gating)**

→ How value scales (e.g., collaboration, automation, governance, etc).

Usually, there’s a feature “theme” that scales the value of a product. Popular
options are collaboration, automation, or sophistication. Make that clear in
the pricing menu.

**4️⃣ Packaging**

→ How you organize your modality, metrics, and features into bundles, usually
as discrete tiers. Although some companies don’t do this, they opt for ‘pay as
you go’ or à la carte packaging.

**5️⃣ Price**

→ How much each option costs, and the billing period.

**6️⃣ Call to Action**

→ What visitors should do next. Usually, either get started, free trial,
request a demo, or contact sales.

The concepts above probably sound more complicated than they actually are.
Ultimately, in the pricing menu, you want to help a visitor quickly understand
how your pricing strategy works and how much it will cost them.

The goal is to help them understand both those things in less than a minute,
preferably 30 seconds. If you can do this without doing anything fancy, by all
means do it – the simpler the better.

Going back to Linear, they communicate all of this extremely efficiently.

And also, Calendly does a pretty good job.

Within a few seconds, visitors understand:

> ✅ Pricing Modality = monthly flat fee (per user)
>
> ✅ Pricing Metric = seat-based (per user) and ‘connected calendars’
>
> ✅ Value Ladder = We need to upgrade for more ‘team features’ like ‘round
> robin’ and ‘CRM integrations’
>
> ✅ Packaging = 4 pricing tiers (from Free to Enterprise)
>
> ✅ Price = around $10 per user per month
>
> ✅ CTA = Clear CTAs per tier

It becomes clear that ‘number of event types’ and ‘connected calendars’ are
key value metrics. And if you need more team features like ‘round robin’ and
‘CRM integrations’, you need to upgrade

(even though we think that Calendly can be more specific about their 14-day
free trial for team accounts)

You only get the info on the 14-day trial once you click on the CTA.

Here’s a list of recommendations to organize your pricing menu’s core
elements:

**1️⃣ Recommendation 1: Keep your Plan Name simple**

People love to obsess over plan names. We don’t think this makes a difference.
Keep it straightforward. But this is just something that people are used to
seeing first, so start there. Common terminology you see a lot is:

  1. Free

  2. Basic

  3. Starter

  4. Standard

  5. Pro

  6. Premium

  7. Plus

  8. Teams

  9. Business

  10. Enterprise

**2️⃣ Recommendation 2: Put the monthly cost of your price**

Under the plan name, you want to put the monthly cost (also for the yearly
plans) and make sure that you’re pinning that monthly cost to whatever your
pricing metric is.

**3️⃣ Recommendation 3: Include the billing period(s)**

You want to make sure that with the price, you’re including the billing period
and how that works. A common way to do this is a toggle up above the pricing
grid.

**4️⃣ Recommendation 4: Highlight Key Features and Usage Thresholds**

Once you have the plan name, the price, and the billing period, you want to
make sure that for each plan, you are highlighting the core features and usage
thresholds that come with each plan. The key here is to keep it concise. Try
to stick to 5 variables, only more if really needed. Include only the usage
metrics that are really important to drive price, and any features that are
critical for plan differentiation.

**5️⃣ Recommendation 5: Add specific CTAs**

The only other thing that is an absolute must is a call-to-action. You want to
have a button for each tier guiding what a visitor should do next.

If it’s a free plan or you lean more PLG, it’s likely “Get Started.”  
If you lean more sales-led, it could be “Request a Demo” or “Contact Sales.”

Importantly, each plan can have a different CTA depending on how it fits into
your GTM motion.

Those are really the core elements of a pricing menu. Beyond that, everything
else is nice to have. If you can communicate everything you need to across
those variables, do it. You don’t want to make your pricing page more
complicated than it has to be.

There are, of course, other interesting things that you can add to the pricing
menu if it makes sense.

Below are a few examples of “nice to have” additions that can help visitors
understand the essential information as well.

**#1 “Best for” Statement**

A “best for” statement tells visitors which plan is best for whom, so it’s
easier for them to decide what tier is best for them. Again, ideally, visitors
can figure that out quickly on their own without being told, but if not, a
“best for” statement can help. Figma does a really good job of this, as shown
below:

**#2 Used by**

You can add social proof in your pricing table by adding companies using this
price plan.

Livestorm does this

**#3 Key Features**

You can go even deeper with feature emphasis, highlighting specific features
that are important to your product, and how different plans allow customers to
access those features. An example would be what Notion does with Notion AI.
Below the key features section, there’s an additional section dedicated to
Notion AI, highlighting what each plan gets within that feature category.

**#4 Pricing Calculator**

Many SaaS companies don’t have a flat license fee for all users, and need to
allow visitors to customize pricing based on their own needs. A popular way to
do this is with a slider. Ideally, the price points for each plan will
dynamically change as you slide up and down.

Klaviyo is a great example here. They essentially offer 3 options: a free
plan, an Email plan, and an Email + SMS plan. The price of the paid plans is
dictated by database size, message volume, and geography, all of which are
front and center on their pricing page:

Another option is “in-plan” customization, like beehiiv. They have a dropdown
with different contact volumes under the Scale and Max plan to help visitors
decide between the two.

**#5 Visual Differentiation**

Visual design elements can be used to push visitors to a specific tier. You’re
likely familiar with the strategy to highlight a “Recommended” or “Most
Popular” tier.

Superhuman’s approach doesn’t use any words, but brings the Business plan to
the forefront:

One of the more creative examples of visual design is how Figma highlights
which products are included in which seat types. They created a legend with an
icon for each Figma product, then dropped each icon in the appropriate seat
within each plan:

**#6 Enterprise Tier**

The last nuance of the pricing menu is what to do with the Enterprise plan.
The two decisions you need to make are:

  1. Where to show the Enterprise plan.

  2. Whether or not to show price.

We recommend including the Enterprise plan in the pricing menu to keep things
simple, and if possible, even show the price.

If you can’t or don’t want to show the full price, at least provide a “starts
at” price.

This comes with 2 advantages:

  1. Bringing the Enterprise plan into the main grid makes it easy to compare all plans in one place. And it leaves the real estate outside the pricing menu for add-ons and professional services.

  2. By showing a “starts at” price, the price for every other plan immediately looks better by comparison. Classic price anchoring. And if your competitors don’t show Enterprise pricing, you get better optics for being transparent with customers.

**#7 Product Tabs**

The very last thing is organizing multiple products. If you have multiple
products that visitors can explore, you want to make it very clear how pricing
works for each. Most companies will have tabs for each product above the
Pricing Menu to make it easy to navigate.

For instance, Toast has a simple toggle for its two core personas: restaurants
and retail.

If you have multiple products that can be purchased together, you also may
want to highlight bundle opportunities, like HubSpot.

The feature comparison table acts as the second line of fire. The main pricing
menu should answer the vast majority of questions that visitors have about
your pricing.

If there are answers that they can’t get from the main menu, like specific
features or usage limits, that’s what the feature comparison table is for.

The feature comparison table is straightforward, but there are a few essential
elements.

**#1 Feature Categories**

First and foremost, you want to group your features into logical categories.

This is going to be very product and market-specific.

A good example is Ramp. They break their feature category table into intuitive
sections, including Corporate Card, Travel, Expense Management, Accounts
Payable, Procurement, Treasury, and Accounting.

**#2 Clear Differentiation**

The next step is making it clear which features are included in which tier.
Most companies either use checkboxes or X-marks. Linear uses a combination of
the two and shading to show which features are included in each plan:

**#3 Tooltips**

Ideally, it’s easy enough to understand what your features do without
additional context, but if you need to provide more context, there are a
couple of ways to do this.

Some companies use circular bubbles with an “i” that you can hover over to
learn more about a feature.

Others will use a dotted underline under the feature name, and others will use
an asterisk.

They all work.

Here’s an example from Loom below, for Auto-video enhancement.

Clear categories, simple differentiation, and tooltips for additional context
are all you really need in your feature comparison table.

If you want to take it to the next level and make it particularly visitor-
friendly, you can use expandable navigation.

**# 4 Expandable Navigation**

There are several ways to use expandable navigation. For instance, Asana makes
the entire Feature Comparison Table expandable.

Figma makes all feature categories expandable.

They also allow visitors to view the feature comparison table by seat type,
and have a sticky header for plan names.

This allows plan names to remain visible as you scroll, so you don’t get lost
wondering which feature is available in which plan.

The FAQ section should act as your final line of defense before somebody gets
in touch with sales. The idea is that 99% of a visitor’s questions can be
answered by the time they get through the FAQ section.

As you scroll down the page, you start with the main pricing menu, and most of
the questions should be answered.

Then you get to the feature comparison table. Hopefully, any ambiguity around
features or usage metrics by plan is answered.

If there’s anything left over that needs to be answered, that’s what the FAQ
section is for.

There are a few best practices when it comes to FAQ:

  1. **Make it accordion-style/expandable.** Otherwise, it will look like a wall of text.

  2. **Limit it to 8-12 questions max.** If you have more than that, you can probably be clearer in the sections above.

  3. **Link to full documentation.** Provide links to your help center, knowledge base, or support section if necessary.

The FAQ section can be industry-specific. However, we will share a few very
common questions that you should address as well.

→ Explain in detail how you define your value metric. A good example is
Livestorm, they charges based on ‘active contacts’.

→ Re-emphasizing your ideal customers. Clay is doing this quite well.

→ In case you do, add it as an FAQ (helps LLM understand your pricing). Canva
is a good example

Billing and payment are popular topics across the board. Listing a few of the
most common questions that we see below.

>   * What happens when I exceed my limit?
>
>   * What is your refund policy?
>
>   * Do you offer discounts? (nonprofits, education, annual)
>
>   * What payment methods do you accept?
>
>   * Is my data secure/compliant? (GDPR, SOC 2, etc.)
>
>

Clay has a particularly simple FAQ section that provides broader context on
their product, customers, users, and use cases.

The sections above are the most important pieces of a pricing page. However,
there are many optional sections to consider. Breaking those down below:

**# 1 Social Proof**

Social proof can take many forms, including a logo wall, customer quotes,
testimonials, stats, or G2 or Capterra ratings.

Companies drop social proof all over the place, the 3 most common sections
being underneath the Hero section, between the Pricing Menu and the Feature
Comparison Table, and between the Feature Comparison Table and the FAQ.

We don’t have a hard opinion about it, but in the interest of communicating
essential information as quickly and clearly as possible, we would recommend
moving the social proof under the Pricing Menu (and not in the Hero).

Adding relevant logos can be especially powerful for strengthening your
positioning. For instance, if you’re positioning your product as a solution
for innovative companies, and OpenAI is a customer, that’s great social proof.

Another good one is Mixpanel, which shows customers by tier:

**#2 Add-ons and Professional Services**

There are two ways to approach add-ons and professional services:

  1. Provide all information on the pricing page.

  2. List the Add-Ons and Professional Services and link to another page.

Intercom does a great job of adding its add-ons to the pricing page.

Another example is Vidyard, who add its add-on directly on the pricing table.

**#3 Pricing Calculator**

We discussed the slider earlier, but a pricing calculator can be helpful if
you have multiple products, multi-year contract terms, and other variables
that influence the final price point. HubSpot is a great example: they link to
the pricing calculator directly from the pricing page.

**#4 Discounted Plans (Startups, NGOs)**

If you sell to startups and nonprofits, you might offer a dedicated discounted
plan for them.

Asana offers a 50% discount for NGOs.

**#5 Chat Widget**

If you decide to have a live chat embedded on your website, adding it to your
pricing page makes sense, especially to ensure questions are answered and to
escalate questions to a live support person.

Just make sure that if the chat widget is answering questions, it can do so
reliably and accurately, and if you’re routing to another person, they are
consistently available on short notice.

**#6 Trust Signals Footer**

This includes security badges, payment icons, support availability, and
migration assistance if applicable. There’s likely redundancy with the FAQ
section. Include these, especially if, like security badges, they’re a deal-
breaker for prospective customers.

Miro has a ‘security and compliance’ section on their pricing page.

Building an effective pricing page doesn’t require innovation; it requires
clarity.

The framework is straightforward:

  * Hero section that sets context

  * Pricing Menu that communicates essential information

  * Feature Comparison Table that removes ambiguity

  * FAQ that addresses lingering questions

If visitors can understand your pricing model and identify their fit within 30
seconds to a minute, you’ve done your job.

Resist the temptation to pack your pricing page with every detail, feature,
and differentiator.

The best pricing pages respect the visitor’s time and intelligence. They
present information in a familiar structure and highlight what truly matters.

Remember: your visitors have seen this before. They know what they’re looking
for. Your job is simply to make it easy for them to find it.

Start with the basics outlined in this guide. Launch it. Gather feedback.
Iterate. A simple, clear pricing page that helps visitors make confident
decisions will always outperform a complicated one that tries to do too much.
