In today's article, I will share with you 10 hands-on tips for your SaaS
pricing.

The right [pricing strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-
pricing-strategy) directly affects conversion rates, revenue, churn rate, and
NPS scores and has a massive impact on your company’s success. You want to
find the right balance between value and revenue - as both undercharging and
overcharging can harm your growth.

But the average SaaS company only spends 6 hours on their pricing strategy -
ever (not per week).

Let's start with a quick overview of the most common SaaS pricing models
before we dive into the 10 hands-on tips for your SaaS pricing.

Flate-rate pricing is a pretty simple pricing model (not saying that it's not
a great pricing model). You just offer one fixed fee for your product. This
fee can be paid monthly or yearly in advance.

Positive:

Negative:

The cost of the SaaS product is based on the usage of the customer - the more
they use the product the higher the fee. This model is also known as the Pay
As You Go model. Common usage-based metrics are #bookings #api requests
#minutes #emails sent.

Positive:

  * Revenue increases with usage

  * The aligned interest between you and the customer ('grow together')

  * Low entry barrier

  * Prevents users from unprofitable heavy usage

Negative:

With tiered pricing, you offer different pre-defined packages to your
customers. Mostly seen tiers are around included features or included
transactions (see usage-based pricing). Tiered pricing can be seen as a
combination of fixed-fee and usage-based pricing.

Positive:

  * Appealing to many different target personas

  * Therefore huge revenue potential

  * Upselling potential and churn prevention

  * Prevents users from unprofitable heavy usage

Negative:

This model is quite easy to understand and therefore used a lot. The customer
pays for every seat (or also known as user). So your SaaS is limited to #seats
per customer (e.g. 5€/month per user). When the customer grows (needs more
user accounts), your revenue increases with the number of seats.

Positive:

Negative:

Feature pricing can be seen as a sub-category to tiered pricing models. This
means you define the packages of the tiers based on the metric 'features
included'.

Positive:

Negative:

And now let's have a deeper look into 10 hands-on pricing tips for your SaaS
product.

Don't make it too complicated. Your potential customers need to understand
pricing when they are on your pricing page. If they don't get it, they won't
sign up for your product. Most of the time the easier the pricing the better.

Tip: Ask 10 random people to go on your pricing page and let them pitch your
pricing to you. If they can't easily pitch it to you, it's a clear sign that
your pricing is too complicated.

To keep it simple and easy to understand for your potential customer, limit
the number of options they can choose from. It's called the paradox of choice
- the more options they have to choose from the harder it's for them to make a
decision.

If you offer different pricing plans, let them only differ on one metric (e.g.
seats included, features included, #bookings, etc.). If you change more than
one metric, it will get way harder for them to compare between the plans.

First, identify what defines the value of your product. Secondly, think about
how you can charge for your SaaS, based on the value it drives for your
customer (value-based pricing). Ideally, you can scale your revenue with
increased value for the customer (e.g. charge based on #bookings or #emails
send or #revenue generated...).

If you decide on tiered pricing, offer preferably 3 tiers. Or in case you keep
it simple (fixed fee pricing) just offer one standard pricing (e.g. 1% of
revenue or 1€ per lead, email sent, booking...). If you offer 3 pricing tiers,
make sure you highlight the plan which you want most customers to sign up for
(see #6 Isolation Effect).

The conversion rate is the highest if you highlight one of your tiers.
Consumers tend to decide on products that are highlighted or in some way
'isolated' from the rest of the options. A great way to do this is to
highlight one tier with a badge (e.g. most popular), different color, or a
frame.

Pricing with odd numbers converts better. This is most probably because of the
[Left-Digit Effect](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-
games/201306/the-left-digit-effect-why-game-prices-end-in-99). So when
deciding on the exact pricing, keep odd numbers in mind.

Price anchoring is a concept, where you leverage the fact, that humans use
reference points to assess the price and value of something. Use smart pricing
(nudging) to nudge customers for your preferred tier. One powerful way is to
make your more expensive tier 'relatively' cheap compared to the cheaper
options, so your customers get the feeling that this is a 'great deal'.

Especially if you target consumers, prosumers and SMBs, make sure you offer
free trials of your product (if you offer enterprise software, I wouldn't
recommend a free trial). Make sure you have a great product onboarding in
place (e.g. step-by-step guide, product tours, product videos, email
onboarding automation...) and that your customers experience the value of your
product as fast as possible.

Offering yearly billing options is great for your cash flow and can help you
to reduce the churn rate. Make sure your customers pay the yearly (discounted)
fee upfront. I would recommend making the yearly plan 10% to 20% cheaper
compared to monthly billing.
