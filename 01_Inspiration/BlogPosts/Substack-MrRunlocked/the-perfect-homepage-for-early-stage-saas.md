Losing customers that took so much effort to acquire?
[Raaft](https://raaft.io/) helps SaaS companies save churning customers with 3
tactics:

  1. Know which users are likely to cancel soon

  2. Retain users on auto-pilot at the moment of cancellation with targeted offers depending on their churn reason

  3. Get great churn analytics so you can know how to improve your product.

Your homepage is the number one [customer-facing messaging
asset](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-
framework). Almost all your potential clients will visit your website and
decide if they continue the ‘buyer journey’ (aka. [Free
Trial](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/free-trials-fundamentals) or
[Book a demo](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-guide-
to-sales-product-demos)) or stop.

Keep in mind that your homepage should primarily speak to your potential
customers (aka. your ICP - [ideal customer
profile](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-
profile)) - and not to your employees, investors, media, or any other
stakeholders.

The goal of your homepage is to convert your visitors to the next stage of
your sales journey (mostly free trial or book a demo). This being said, your
homepage and messaging should focus on this primary objective.

What this also means is to focus on the important key elements - and not to
cover all your features, benefits, and in-detail questions your customers
could face along the way.

Your website should provide answers to the **6 key questions** of your
visitors:

  1. What is the product/service they offer?

  2. What problem does it solve for me?

  3. What can I do with the product?

  4. Who is it for? Is this product for me?

  5. What are the main benefits for me?

  6. Can I trust the company?

To get this right, you need to have:

  1. Solid understanding of your [ideal customers](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile)

  2. A first version of your [SaaS messaging](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-framework)

Bonus:

P.S. If you are pre-revenue and don’t have enough data about your ICP and
messaging, try to talk to at least 20+ potential customers and based on that
draft your version 1 of the ICP and messaging. Once you gather more info
(customer support, sales demos, trial data, etc.) you need to adapt both.

Now let’s have a look into the different sections for a powerful SaaS website.
We will go from top to bottom and cover each section.

[Get your SaaS Website Template](https://miro.com/miroverse/the-perfect-saas-

or simply use our [SaaS Homepage Figma
Template](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/how-to-high-converting-saas-homepage).

The navigation bar consists of:

  * your logo (top left)

  * the ‘actual’ navigation with the _product, pricing, resources,_ and _about us_ pages

  * your call to action(s) - primary and softer secondary CTA

On top of the navigation bar, you can embed a floating element to promote
things that you want to highlight right now, like your latest funding round,
an upcoming webinar, or new feature announcements.

Keep in mind that with the suggested site structure (navigation bar) you can
easily add more pages as you’re growing and have more resources to build more
specific pages (e.g. pages for each feature, use cases, newsletter,
integrations, etc.)

The hero section is the most important section of your website.

Most visitors only stay on the top part of your page and only start to scroll
down and skim through your page, if your above-the-fold section is powerful
and grabs their attention.

If not, you will see very low conversion rates and high bounce rates.

Both design and copy need to be on point. Nice design, but a bad copy, doesn’t
show any significant results.

The goal of this section is to grab the attention so that the visitor stays on
your page and continues to read.

The section needs to answer the core questions:

  * What is your product (aka. product category) and what can I do with the product (aka. capabilities)

  * What’s the value of the product (aka. benefits)

  * Is this product for me? (aka. ICP)

  * What does it look like? (aka. product image/animation/video)

  * Bonus:

    * proactively address most common objections (e.g. no credit card required; set-up in under 10 minutes, 100% GDPR compliant)

    * creating trust (e.g. Capterra badges, G2 reviews, etc.)

To answer these questions, you have the following elements of the hero
section:

  * Your Headline (H1)

  * The text below your H1 (e.g. H2 or description)

  * the text box below your CTA buttons

  * image/video to tease your product

So to get the copy write in this section, make use of (open your [Ultimate
SaaS messaging framework](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-
ultimate-saas-messaging-framework)):

  1. Product category

  2. Problem & desired outcome/dream state

  3. ICP (persona & company type)

  4. Capabilities

  5. Top Features

  6. Main Benefits

  7. Top objections

In terms of call-to-actions (CTA) I would recommend going for one primary CTA
([free trial for PLG companies & book a demo for sales-led
companies](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-
led-saas-growth)) and a softer secondary CTA (e.g. Join a Webinar, Download
Lead Magnet, Watch product demo, etc.)

After the hero section, it’s time to create trust. It’s called social proof.

The most common way is to showcase some of your customers (logos).

On top add a small tagline where you highlight again your ICP. This could
sound like the following:

  * 100+ leading tech startups trust XYZ

  * Trusted by 5000+ freelancers worldwide

  * 10k+ salespeople close deals faster with XYZ

But you can also use testimonials, case studies, third-party reviews (e.g.
Capterra, G2, Trustpilot, etc.), or press/ media coverage (e.g. featured in
X).

Depending on your design of the page, this section can even be visible already
in the ‘above the fold’.

The problem section is something that most SaaS companies forget about - I
believe this is a big mistake.

With this section, you set the context. You connect with the visitor and
present them with the ‘shitty’ status quo they are in right now - before you
introduce your product as the right solution.

This section mainly has 2 reasons for existing:

  * Tell the visitors about their ‘shitty’ status quo, so they know they have a problem (that’s worth fixing).

  * (dis)qualify visitors: if they do not resonate with this section, there’s a high chance that your product is NOT relevant to them.

If you ignore this section, you assume that your customers know about their
shitty status quo. And I doubt that everyone knows it.

If you use the [SaaS Messaging
Framework](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-
messaging-framework) the following elements are your friend:

Here are some great inspirations for _problem (before X)_ sections:

Now after your visitors are aware of the problem (of their current solution),
it’s time to introduce the hero (aka. your product). It’s the better/new way
(compared to the shitty current solution).

Most of the time, this is just a super small section that consists of 1-2
sentences. Ideally combine your product category, the main benefit it brings
to your ICP, and/or the main capability of your product.

It’s the headline for the upcoming capabilities section where you go into more
detail about what the product enables the user to do (which they can’t do
without using your tool).

Now once the visitors understand the problem you are going to solve for them
(problem section) + how you solve it (intro solution section), you can finally
present your product.

But keep in mind that it’s not a product tour, help center article, or set-up
instruction. It’s not about showing all your features in detail.

The best is to communicate:

  * The main 3 capabilities (what users can do with your product, they can’t do without)

  * The top features (that power the capabilities)

  * The main benefits your users get from this

  * Show the corresponding feature in your product (image, gif, animation, etc.)

**Here are some great inspirations for** _**capabilities**_**sections:**

Now after the capability sections, you can add 1 or 2 sections to address
specific needs or objections of your visitors.

There are different options for how you can use these 'special purpose'
sections:

  * Show all features (e.g. Wall, Feature Tabs)

  * How it works

  * Case Studies

  * Blog Section

  * Templates

  * Intro of different Usecase Pages

  * Intro of different Segmentation Pages (different persona / Company Type pages)

  * Highlighting relevant infos for ICP (e.g objections, GDPR, Integrations, Security)

**Here are some great inspirations for these** _**special
purpose**_**sections:**

So you see you have many options.

The bottom of your page should be a second social proof element and a final
CTA section.

For social proof, you can promote your case studies and embed customer
testimonials/quotes or third-party reviews/badges from sites like G2,
Capterra, OMR reviews, etc.

Don’t forget to add a final CTA at the end of your page. Focus on your primary
CTA and re-state your value proposition in 1-2 short sentences.

This section is the last one before the footer of your page.

**Here are some great inspirations for** _**main CTA**_**section:**

Keep in mind that there is not just ‘one way’ to do it - obviously, you can
tweak your version based on this template. But it gives you a very solid
baseline to get your SaaS website to perform.

Now you know the structure of the perfect homepage.

**Here are some more general tips for building your perfect homepage:**

  1. Have a CTA/button (in almost) every section

  2. Use powerful maximum 3 words CTA (like Get started, Free trial, Book a demo, Sign-up free, 14-day free trial, Request access, Join waitlist)

  3. Headline matters: 80% of the visitors only read the headlines

     1. aim for 6 words headlines over max. 2 lines

     2. the contrast of colors to make it easy to read

  4. Conversational tone + language of your ICP

  5. Talk directly to the visitor (speak to one person)

  6. Keep the copy short and easy to understand

With GTM, you have 3 to 18 months to win sufficient demand from your Beachhead
Segment - your minimum viable market segment.

When there is existing demand, always try to focus on demand capture first.
Similarly, you can initially capture demand from adjacent categories when
you're selling a solution that is novel and requires education. For both of
these activities, make sure you're prioritizing activities and channels that
require lower investments, give you a quick feedback loop, and have shorter
sales cycles. Definitely stay away from SEO until you have product-market fit.

Since only 5% of your market is in the buying mode at any given time, you can
quickly saturate your demand capture and then it's time to start working on a
long-term, more sustainable mechanism of demand generation. Think of organic &
paid social, community and brand building, virtual and in-person events.
