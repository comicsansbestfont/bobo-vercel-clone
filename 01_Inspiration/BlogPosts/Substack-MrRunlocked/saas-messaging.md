Today we want to cover how you can turn your SaaS messaging framework into
powerful sales & marketing assets (homepage, sales deck, cold emails, etc.)

The [Ultimate SaaS Messaging Framework](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-
ultimate-saas-messaging-framework) is used now by more than 300 SaaS
companies.

[SaaS Messaging Framework (Miro)](https://miro.com/miroverse/ultimate-saas-
messaging-framework-template/)

It’s the foundation for all your customer-facing communication.

But I frequently get the question:

**What should we do now with the Messaging framework???**

In the beginning, I was surprised.

Because I thought it was clear.

My answer was always something along the way:

**It’s the foundation for all your customer-facing communication ‘assets’.
Build your website, sales deck, emails, etc….**

Your messaging is the foundation to build your key assets like:

The ultimate goal is that it makes your GTM more efficient and consistent.

So you don’t need to start at zero every time you:

You will use a consistent narrative.

So let’s cover the steps you can do once you have your Messaging Framework.

I like to turn the messaging framework into a short version.

**It’s your sales story / POV (point of view).**

It’s your sales narrative. The way you look at the market.

Everyone in your company needs to know this.

We covered it in our [previous
newsletter](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/simple-value-proposition-canvas).

You can turn the value proposition canvas into 3 sentences.

It’s your elevator pitch.

With these core messaging assets in place, you’re well-equipped for your GTM
work.

Each element of your messaging finds its place on your homepage.

Your homepage is the visual part of your sales story.

[Here’s my Free Homepage template](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-perfect-
homepage-for-early-stage-saas).

Another crucial marketing/sales asset is your sales deck.

Again each part of the messaging framework finds its place.

deck-template)

We all face it. Objections.

Part of the messaging framework is to collect your most common objections.

You need to handle them.

In your:

To be prepared for this, use my [objection handling
template](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/how-to-handle-top-customer-
objections).

The list goes on. Because messaging is everywhere.

The point is. Each of these assets relies on a solid messaging framework.

Includes the status quo, competitive alternatives, problem, jobs to be done,
desired outcome, benefits, objections…

Includes market insights, assumed pains, 1-sentence value proposition…

Includes again the status quo, identified pain, solution (features,
capabilities & benefits), but maybe also answers to objections and your
positioning against competition.

You need to know what your ICP cares about (problem and status quo) to create
content that resonates.

I hope this makes it clear why every SaaS company needs a solid messaging
framework.

Marketing attribution has always been controversial as it's hard to measure
correctly with so many touchpoints.

Especially with dark social, multi-device usage, and privacy regulations.

But it’s crucial to know what channels work to optimize your campaigns.

And also to double down and invest more €€€.

The solution?

Keep it simple!

**Ask your customer.**

It’s called self-reported attribution.

You ask them:

“How did you hear about us?”

Depending on your sales motion, the information can be collected in multiple
ways:

1️⃣ Sign-up form / Book demo

2️⃣ Onboarding flow

3️⃣ On the sales call

You can combine these methods.

Make sure that you save this information in your CRM (custom field).
