A sales deck is a presentation that you and your sales team use to pitch your
product to potential customers (unlike a pitch deck that’s being used to pitch
to investors).

Most of the time the sales deck is being used during [product sales
demos](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-sales-
product-demos) \- but (a slightly modified version) can also be used for
prospecting and demo follow-ups (material that’s being provided to buyers
after the demo via email or uploaded to digital sales rooms like
[Simpliciter](https://simpliciter.io/)).

It’s a core sales material, being used throughout the buyer journey:

  1. Prospecting (e.g. Outreaching with the [TAPSA framework](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/cold-email-template))

  2. (Virtual and in-person) Product Demos (—> [Ultimate Sales Demo Guide](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-sales-product-demos))

  3. Follow-Up material

  4. or even for pre-recorded demos, webinars, or onboarding sessions (—> especially for [PLG companies](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-saas-growth))

Your sales deck lays the foundation for good storytelling and helps to get
your [messaging and positioning](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-
saas-messaging-framework) right.

**Why it matters**

A great sales deck:

  * guide your salespersons

  * is great for setting the context and selling with a story

  * helps the prospects to follow you (during the demo)

  * is a great way to sneak in social proof

  * is a great material for prospects to use internally after the demo

But now you ask yourself what’s included in a powerful sales deck? That’s why
I created a template for the perfect sales deck structure (see below).
* * *

The structure of your sales deck matters. It’s not about all your features,
it’s about telling a story.

I will share what content needs to be on each slide and what’s the goal of the
slide (how the prospect should feel and think at that moment).

📖 You can open the slides in full mode, you see an option to download the
slides.

> good'_

**Slide 10: Pricing**

How do you charge clients? What pricing plan is for whom?

> 🤔  _'Okay, I understand that plan X is right for us & it costs X€ + I see a
> realistic ROI'_

**Slide 11: FAQs/Objections**

Proactively share the most common objections and your answers to them (concern
handling).

> 🤔  _'Yes those were actually my concerns. But this sounds solid. They earn
> trust points.'_

**Slide 12: Next Steps / CTA**

What do you want them to do next? Provide guidance. (Free trial, Book demo,
etc.)

> 🤔  _'I exactly know what I need to do next. Will do this right now...'_

So now you know the secret structure of a powerful sales deck. 12 slides,
clear structure, powerful story.

> Stop procrastinating with equity grants promised to your team.

It’s a common mistake I see way too often: founders making equity promises to
new hires and postponing the actual grant process several months, sometimes
years, later.

There are 3 main reasons why you should avoid procrastinating with equity
compensation:

  1. **The value of your equity and your cap table will change when you don’t expect it and you’ll have to retro-engineer everything**

     1. If you communicate equity granted in $-value or in % of ownership (instead of a fixed number of shares/options) you might struggle to reconcile promises made to team members at different points in time

     2. We’ve seen clients at Easop who raised several rounds of financing (via SAFE notes with different caps or via priced rounds) and communicated a $-value to be granted to team members as they joined the company (which is a great way to make it tangible)

     3. If you communicate a % of ownership, be sure to know what was the fully diluted count at the moment of the offer otherwise you’ll have to retrace the full history of the company’s cap table

  2. **The exercise price cannot be defined based on the date of the promise, it will be based on the date of the actual grant so the more you wait, the less favorable it will be for your team members**

     1. The strike price or exercise price of options is generally based on the fair market value of the company at the moment of the grant, not at the moment of the promise

     2. You can generally make a vesting start at the moment of the promise but the exercise price will remain the same for the full batch of grants you make even if team members have joined earlier than others and would have benefited from a lower exercise price if their grants had been made when they joined.

  3. **If an employee leaves the company it is impossible to make a grant a posteriori**

     1. In general, one of the rules that the stock option plans state is that equity can only be granted to team members who are active employees or service providers

     2. If you postpone equity grants for too long and have people who, in theory, actually deserve an equity grant that has been promised but leave the company before it’s implemented, the company will struggle to honor its promise

[Easop](https://www.easop.com/) helps US companies stay compliant in 70+
countries, incentivizing employees, contractors, and advisors while
eliminating risks, costs, and data scarcity.

[Pitch](https://pitch.com/) is a powerful presentation builder and super easy
to use. Unlike Powerpoint or Google Slides, you can create beautiful
presentations in minutes - without being a designer.

It’s great for sales decks:

  * Easy to edit (for salespeople)

  * Can be shared with prospects via trackable links

  * Get insights on slides that are most viewed

I personally use it for my presentations and our sales team at
[Locaboo](https://www.locaboo.com/) as well.

Happy growth 🚀.
