Every year, I take the time between Christmas and New Year to reflect on my
year, the ups and downs, the learnings, and set new goals for the next year
(doing a [Life Review)](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/life-
review-for-more-clarity).

Reflecting on the year also means analyzing every single newsletter and
LinkedIn post of the year.

While I was doing this, I thought it was a nice idea to select the **TOP 10
Newsletters and Posts of the year** and share them with you.

2023 was also the year when I saw the first sign of real subscriber growth.

The year, when I finally found content-market fit.
