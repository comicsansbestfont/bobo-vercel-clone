Your sales deck is only as good as your GTM strategy.

❌ This means that if you lack a clear positioning and don’t know how to talk
about your product (aka messaging), your sales deck won’t work.

So before you create your sales deck, get your GTM foundations right:

1️⃣ [Ideal Customer Profile](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-
customer-profile)

2️⃣ [Positioning ](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-positioning-6-different-
ways)

3️⃣ [Messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-
framework)

👉 Each element of the SaaS messaging framework relates to 1 slide on your
sales deck.

**❌ A list of all your features.**  
Overloading with features dilutes the focus on solving the prospect's specific
pain points.

**❌ A presentation of your vision.**  
Prospects care about immediate solutions, not your 5-year roadmap.

**❌ A VC pitch deck.**  
Sales decks should focus on the customer, not investors.

**❌ A wall of text.**  
Slides overloaded with information. One slide = 1 message.

**❌ A technical manual.**  
Avoid diving deep into technical details. It’s not your documentation or help
center.

Instead, your sales deck is a structured way to share your POV.

It’s guiding your potential clients **from the shitty status quo to the
desired outcome.**

**In a nutshell, it’s about telling a story of:**

✅ how they currently do ‘usecase’

✅ what the problem and limitations of this are (why it matters)

✅ how they overcome the current situation using your product

✅ what they will achieve (results)

✅ that they can trust you and that they are not alone (social proof)

**A great sales deck:**

✅ guide you/your salesperson during a sales meeting

✅ helps you to share your POV and set the context

✅ makes it easier to sell with a story

✅ helps the prospects to follow you (during the demo)

✅ allows you to add social proof very naturally

✅ is a great material for prospects to use internally after the demo

So let’s go slide by slide to give you a great structure for your sales deck 👇

I will share:
* * *

Add your company name, company logo, and your 1-sentence description.

🤔 _'Sounds cool, the design looks also good...Let's get started...'_

Set the context. Share your insight about the market. What's changing and why
it matters?

🤔 _'Wow. That's shocking/interesting/awesome. Curious how/why this is
relevant...'_

What is the problem for them? Why it is a real pain?

🤔 _'Oh shit. I have this pain and it sucks...'_

Describe the (shitty) status quo of your ideal customers.

🤔 _'That's me. I know this situation...'_

High-Level Information about your Product

🤔 _'I get the context of WHAT you do. I'm interested in more details.'_

Highlighting the top 3 Capabilities & Features

🤔 ‘ _I now understand what I can do with the product (but not how - it's not a
training)'_

**(— > Now you switch to screen sharing your product)**

Now you switch to presenting your product (the actual 'product demo')

🤔 _'Focus on the main USECASES and how it solves the problem of the prospect'_

Explain what's in for them! Focus on max. 3-4 benefits.

🤔 _'That's cool (and believable and relevant).I want the same results.'_

Add Social Proof elements. Case Studies, Testimonials, Reviews, Badges, Logos.

🤔 _'Wow, they work with very similar companies to us. They need to be good'_

How do you charge clients? What pricing plan is for whom?

🤔 _'Okay, I understand that plan X is right for us & it costs X€ + I see a
realistic ROI'_

Emphasize why they need to act now. Remember, not making a decision (staying
with the status quo) is your number 1 lost reason.

🤔 _'We need to act now. Continue doing as it is painful/expensive'_

Proactively share the most common objections and your answers to them (concern
handling).

🤔 _'Yes those were my concerns. But this sounds solid. They earn trust
points.'_

What do you want them to do next? Provide guidance. (Free trial, Book demo,
etc.)

🤔 _'I exactly know what I need to do next. Will do this right now...'_
