PLG SaaS companies offer the product (or some part of it) for free and bet on
the fact that users will experience the value of the product and then make
their purchasing decision.

So the fundamental challenge you will face in PLG is that you can’t
communicate your product’s value proposition in a [1:1 sales
demo](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-sales-
product-demos) (as there is no salesperson involved) - new users need to
understand the value of your product in a self-service way.

Your primary goal: make sure that you effectively communicate the value
proposition, and remove the friction so new users can experience the value in
a short amount of time (time to value).

If you choose [product-led growth
(PLG)](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-
saas-growth) as your primary growth motion, you will ultimately think about
free trials.

Your first goal is to get website visitors to sign up for your product and
create an account.

The sign-up page is a page where lots of startups see a high bounce rate.

Use this page to re-emphasize why they should sign up for your product, and
what’s in for them.

The following aspects can/should be highlighted on the page:

Sign-Up Page - Main Capability

Asking new users couple of questions has multiple benefits. First, you will
gather a lot of insights about who they are (to sharpen your ICP) and about
their motivations and goals (what they want to achieve with your product).

This information helps you later on to convert them to paying customers (e.g.
with personalized onboarding emails or even in-product paths).

I would recommend asking the following:

Tracking lead sources is hard. One way to overcome (or at least get some good
insights) this is self-reported attribution. It basically means that you ask
new sign-ups how they hear about you.

Once you have them in your product, your job is to make it super easy (and
fast) for them to experience the value. A great way is to show/tell them what
they need to do.

Onboarding Checklist

There are 2 ways to do this:

Miro is doing this really awesome. Also Airtable is a great inspiration.

They literally have a whole learning center (that they also use for content
marketing).

Make it easy to upgrade. Your CTA should be always visible in the product. It
helps if you add the info when the trial ends.

Reverse free trial means that you give full access to all features for a
limited time (trial period). At the end of the trial period users have the
option to continue using the product (convert to paid plans) or downgrade to a
free plan with limited features.

Check out the [Guide to Reverse Trials by
Openviewpartners](https://openviewpartners.com/blog/your-guide-to-reverse-
trials/).

Now you know the 8 fundamentals of Free trials.

Make it super easy to get other users on board. Invite and sharing features
are super powerful here.

I work a lot with early-stage founders on their journey to hit €1 million
annual recurring revenue (ARR).

One of the things that we discuss most is the importance of a powerful [GTM
strategy](https://alexestner.gumroad.com/l/saas-growth-worksheet) and the
tactics and activities you are doing on a daily basis.

And honestly, both are equally important.

The best GTM strategy without the operational tactics doesn’t bring you
anywhere.

But also doing the daily activities without having a proper strategy will only
burn your cash and don’t drive any relevant revenue. You will attract 0
clients, your conversion rates will be very low and ultimately burn your
money. 🔥

[GTM strategy](https://alexestner.gumroad.com/l/saas-growth-worksheet) and
[growth tactics](https://alexestner.gumroad.com/l/database-growth-strategies-
saas) belong to each other. One only works in combination with the other.

You know that I’m helping early-stage B2B SaaS founders to grow from 0€ to 1M€

At the moment I do this in two ways: **Advisory/Sparring** & **Consulting.**

As many of you ask for it, I’m now launching a 3rd way 🎉.

A **12-week 1-on-1 SaaS GTM coaching program for early-stage B2B SaaS founders
and leaders on their way to €1 million ARR**.

Winning new paying customers can be a very long way. Knowing this can
negatively impact your motivation, but also your confidence in closing new
customers.

That’s why it’s better to break down the long journey into multiple small
steps. Each of the steps is way easier to achieve. I know it’s just a mindset
thing - but believe me, it will help you close more deals faster.

Here is how to do it:

  * Don't try to close in the first step (Sales is a marathon, not a sprint)

  * don’t think about '1 transaction', think about multiple small transactions.

Your job is to get the prospects to give you 1 small 'yes' after each other.

Signing the contract is just a small Yes at the end of the marathon.

In the end, it is not 1 BIG YES, but rather lots of small incremental 'Yeses'.

> There are no growth hacks that work forever (laser focus on what’s working).

We have realized that exploring new acquisition and distribution channels can
indeed be done relatively quickly. However, the true challenge lies in finding
the right features and **ROI positive** channels. We spent months developing
and refining them, only to find out that they didn't resonate with our target
audience. It made us realize that spending too much time and resources on
building features without validating their value can be detrimental to our
growth. Learning from this failure, we came up with a 3 step process to
evaluate demand and messaging.

**1\. SEO & Email Marketing (Lead Generation)**:

Before building out a feature. We write content around what our ICP is
searching for and provide valuable and helpful insights. If this doesn’t work
we know that there is not enough demand for them or that we need to do more
education. Both are very expensive to scale.

**2\. Personalized Journeys:**

We believe that every user and deal is different. Therefore we take the
inbound/outbound leads and start interacting with them on a personal level by
providing helpful insights and building rapport. In this phase, we can gauge
how big the impact and demand of our solution is for each lead.

**3\. Eat your own dog food:**

While our leads get to know meetergo they can interact directly with our
features like the resource hub and book a discovery call straight out of it.
In that way, they can see the value while also gaining trust in the solution
and company. We are our most critical customer.

At [meetergo](https://meetergo.com/) we strive to be as helpful as possible to
every visitor, lead, or customer. We offer free video courses on lead
generation and conversion tactics as well as advanced techniques in SEO or
E-Mail Marketing. If our clients can’t generate a positive ROI why would they
be paying for our tool?
