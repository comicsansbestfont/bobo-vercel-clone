As you might know, building the GTM foundation from €0 to 1€ million ARR is
very special to me. 🙌

It’s what I’ve been doing the past 3+ years.

So, before we jump right into it, I want you to be with me, so we have the
same understanding.

I want you to understand the following 3 things:

  1. **Make sure you read[part 1](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-gtm-foundation) of the GTM Foundation**

  2. **GTM foundation = What brings you to Product-Market Fit & 1€ million ARR**

The 0-1€ stage is at least 3 different stages:

👉 Hustle mode,

👉 Focus Mode, and

👉 then Expansion Mode.

You need to reach problem-solution fit, then GTM-fit, BEFORE you scale.

  3. **GTM Foundation consists of (at least) 10 fundamental elements**

When I talk about building a strong GTM foundation, I refer to these 10
elements:

  1. Ideal Customer Profile (✅ covered in **[part 1](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-gtm-foundation))**

  2. Positioning (✅ covered in **[part 1](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-gtm-foundation))**

  3. Messaging (✅ covered in **[part 1](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-gtm-foundation))**

  4. GTM Collaterals

  5. Channels

  6. Pricing

  7. Sales Motion

  8. CRM & Tracking

  9. Forecasting & Planning

  10. Internal Operating Systems

Feel free to use the **GTM checklist** to start working on your GTM 👇

Element 1,2 and 3 we covered already in [Part 1 of the GTM foundation
series](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-gtm-foundation). So let’s start
with element 4 - your GTM collaterals.

Of course, you can have lots of different collateral, but there are a few
**that 99% of you need:**

  1. Your Homepage

  2. Other website pages: Pricing page + Book a Demo page + How it works pages (feature / usecase pages) + Resource pages

  3. Sales Deck

  4. Case Studies

  5. LinkedIn profiles

So let’s have a look at these.

The goal of your homepage is to convert your visitors to the next stage of
your sales journey (mostly free trial or book a demo).

A [perfect SaaS homepage](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/how-to-high-
converting-saas-homepage) consists of 7 sections

The good thing: Every section of the [Messaging
Framework](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-
framework) (GTM Element 3) finds its place on the homepage. So we ‘simply’
turn the messaging framework into powerful homepage sections.

People who visit your pricing page usually have some sort of buying intention.

A few ways you can make your [pricing page
better](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/144327752/pricing-page-quick-fixes)

  * Add logos for social proof on the page

  * Maybe even add logos to tiers on the pricing table

  * Highlight the discount from the annual billing

  * Highlight the popular plan

  * Short tagline of who the plan is for

  * Adding a customer quote

These pages are pages with more detailed information on your product.

Feature pages contain information on the specific features of your product - 1
dedicated page per feature (+ an additional pillar page with a feature
overview).

If you solve multiple use cases, you can (and should) build dedicated pages
for each use case.

**Example: Livestorm Use Case Pages**

Additionally, if you target multiple different personas and/or industries, it
might be relevant to build dedicated pages for each of them.

These are pages where your content lives. Templates, Webinars, Newsletter,
Blog, Lead Magnets, Calculators, and much more.

Your sales deck (similar to your website) is a core GTM asset. You share them
with your potential customers (during a demo, and/or before/after a sales
conversation).

So you need to make sure your deck is a structured way to share your POV and
helps guide potential customers from their shitty status quo to desired
outcome.

Use this structure for a great sales deck

  * Slide 1: Cover slide

  * Slide 2: Market insight / macro trend

  * Slide 3: The problem

  * Slide 4: Status Quo (old way)

  * Slide 5: Solution (new way)

  * Slide 6: Solution

  * Slide 7: Product demo

  * Slide 8: Benefits

  * Slide 9: Trust / social proof

  * Slide 10: Pricing

  * Slide 11: Why now / cost of inaction

  * Slide 12: Objections / FAQs

  * Slide 13: CTA / Next steps

sales-deck)

People only trust what they see working and driving results. That’s where
[case studies and testimonials](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/guide-case-
studies) become your secret weapon.

If you don’t have a big customer base yet, look at these places to find your
first testimonials

These testimonials / case studies can be in various forms, like

  * Traditional written

  * Video testimonials

  * Wall of Love

Your case study needs to follow a clear structure to be effective:

✅ The Customer’s Story – who they are & what they do.

✅ The Challenge – what problem did they face before using your SaaS?

✅ The Solution – how your product helped solve that problem.

✅ The Results – quantifiable impact (metrics, revenue growth, time saved,
etc.).

✅ Quote & Image – a strong testimonial (quote + image)

✅ Call-to-Action – Clear next steps for readers.

[Case Study Guide](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/guide-case-studies)

Think of your LinkedIn profiles as a landing page. It’s where most of your
traffic will go once they engage with you.

So make sure it is on point:

1️⃣ Headline: This is one thing that will be visible when you comment or
engage with anyone on LinkedIn. Make sure it is crisp and talks about exactly
what you do.

2️⃣ Banner: Include the problem you solve and social proof

3️⃣ About Section: Talk about your journey, what you do, how you do it, and a
CTA.

4️⃣ Featured: Showcase your best work / resources that the audience can use.

💡If you want to learn how to leverage LinkedIn as a founder,
[this](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/founder-led-linkedin-guide) is the
perfect place to start.

For product-led growth, the product onboarding is part of the acquisition. For
this, I recommend checking out:

For sales-led, it’s more about creating SOPs & templates that you use once
sales close a new customer (welcome email, onboarding preparation, migration
service, activation calls…)

GTM Channels are the ‘bridge’ between your messaging and your target
customers.

You’re leveraging these channels to get in touch with them. To bring your
message to them.

In 20205, you have plenty of options to reach your ICP. But keep in mind that:

1️⃣ You can NOT run more than 3 (better 1-2) in parallel as an early-stage
startup

2️⃣ Not all channels are equally relevant for you (depends on your ICP, ACV,
own skills)

So in the following sections, I will focus on channels & tactics that I
usually recommend for founders at being early stage.

I will try to group them by primary channels (to start with) and secondary
channels (once you find a primary channel). Again, this is not a hard rule,
but rather a rule of thumb.

✅ Reach out to people in your network, ask your investors, advisors, friends,
etc for intros.

✅ Ask your first customers for intros. HOW you ask for them is also important.

This channel is often overlooked and executed very badly. Done right, you can
get warm intros from every customer touchpoint, and it becomes a ‘small
flywheel’.

💡Learn [how to ask for referrals the right
way](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/referral-sales).

💡 [3 Playbooks getting
referrals](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/159337165/bonus-section-referral-
playbooks-using-linkedin) with LinkedIn

##### Content Plan (Pillar Topics) & Stage of Awareness

You can use the[ 4 stages of awareness](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-
ultimate-content-marketing-guide) to plan your content.

These help you understand the level of awareness your customers have towards
the outcome they’re trying to achieve with your product.

##### Founder LinkedIn Posts (Evergreen + Long Form Repurposing)

Focus on [creating quality content](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/founder-led-
linkedin-guide) for your ICP.

These can be either organic posts that aim to answer the questions of your ICP
or posts that you can repurpose from your newsletter / website/ podcases.

[35+ LK Post Templates](https://alexestner.gumroad.com/l/linkedin-post-
templates)

##### BOFU Content Pages

Alternative & comparison pages (for existing product categories) and ‘best
product categories listicles’. Works great in rather crowded red-ocean markets
with existing demand.

💡[25+ Content Page Templates](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/147302979/content-
types-examples)

💡Competing in a crowded market? Think about ‘competitor hubs’ (e.g.
[Livestorm](https://livestorm.co/webinar-software-comparison),
[Breakcold](https://www.breakcold.com/alternatives),
[Senja](https://senja.io/compare))

##### Money Keywords (SEO)

These are [high-intent keywords](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-saas-seo-
guide) for your product. They focus on users who are already aware of the
product and are very much in the market.

##### Review Platforms

Review sites like G2, Capterra, and OMR are great platforms for capturing
existing demand.

Make sure to have a strong profile and be listed in the right product
category.

##### Auto Connect Campaigns with ICP

Use tools like [lemlist](https://www.lemlist.com/?r=0),
[lagrowthmachine](https://lagrowthmachine.com/) to connect to 100+ ICPs per
week.

Doing this for 1 year: 52 weeks * 100 contacts * 30% acceptance rate = 1560
ICPs in your network - on autopilot.

##### Value First Outreach

Share highly valuable content with your ICP via DMs, without any sales pitch.
Learn more about this [social selling
tactic](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/148840640/run-value-first-linkedin-dm-
campaigns).

##### Monitor Signals

Intent signals are a great way to find who is interested in your product.
Monitor [first, second, and third-party
signals](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/allbound-playbooks) to make relevant
and personalized outreach.

##### Value Commenting

Add valuable comments on posts from industry-relevant creators. Be the first
to get impressions and share the link to an additional asset.

💡Learn more about social selling
[here](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/9-linkedin-social-selling-tactics).

##### List Building with Sales Navigator

LinkedIn allows you to build lists of your ICP. We covered this in our [sales
navigator](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/linkedin-sales-navigator-guide)
guide.

##### Email Campaigns

Email still works. You need to send relevant and personalized messages. Not
generic mass emails.

Use the [TAPSA Cold Email
Framework](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/137259555/the-tapsa-cold-email-
framework)

> ##### LinkedIn Prospecting

If you want to run LinkedIn prospecting campaigns, have a look at the [TPPSSB
framework](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/linkedin-prospecting-sequencing).

##### Multi-Channel Prospecting (LinkedIn + Email + (Calls))

Combining different channels usually works better.

Check out my [Lemlist Multi-Channel
Campaign](https://app.lemlist.com/sequence/cam_CkWorEepMkdv6PymZ/seq_deo7aqMaTJo2ayatF)
and simply copy it for your approach. But Lemlist also offers a [library of
successful campaigns](https://www.lemlist.com/cold-email-templates).

##### Allbound Campaigns

Three key components of a solid [allbound
strategy](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/allbound-playbooks) include:

  * Demand generation activities that create signals

  * Signal filter, scoring, and enrichment engine

  * Relevant and personalized outreach

To get started, check out these 4 highly relevant playbooks:

We created a step-by-step guide on how to run these 4 highly relevant[
Allbound playbooks](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/160494234/highly-relevant-
allbound-playbooks-step-by-step) for your SaaS.

Bet on high-intent keywords on Google. [(Google Ads
Guide)](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/google-ads-guide)

We recommend 4 campaign types to get started.

Works great combined with the right content pages (e.g. comparison pages).

It’s about monitoring [online
conversations](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/social-listening-guide) about
your brand, product, and industry, usually via tracking certain keywords.

Focus on high-intent mentions, including:

✅ Brand names (yours + competitors)

✅ Product Categories

✅ Pain Point phrases

✅ Buying intent phrases (e.g. Best X tool; Alternative to Y)

✅ Industry terms

💡 It can be a very effective growth channel - we wrote a [full
guide](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/social-listening-guide) on how to do it
the right way.

Especially if you are building a tool ‘on top’ of an existing market leader,
marketplaces can be a very powerful channel for you.

Marketplaces like Chrome Extensions, Salesforce AppExchange, Hubspot
Ecosystem, Shopify Appstore, Zendesk Marketplace, Zapier App Directory, or
Zoom Marketplace are your friend.

Those were channels that are usually great for first channels.

Now we quickly touch on other channels that might work for you, as secondary
channels.

The following channels usually work better once you have found initial
channels that perform. They require you to have a solid message-market fit and
initial traction.

Referrals can be of two categories

Affiliates are the most common of these because they are

  * Cost-effective and scalable

  * Tap into a network of trusted affiliates bringing in credibility and targeted leads, and conversions

  * Have zero payback time and high ROI because they are on a performance basis

  * Enhance brand reach

💡To learn how to launch your affiliate referral campaign, check out our
[Ultimate Guide to Affiliate Referrals](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/your-
ultimate-guide-to-affiliate-referrals).

💡 Tools like [cello](https://hello.cello.so/TUetwM90eUF) (1000€ discount),
[reditus](https://www.getreditus.com/?red=alexanbeecd1) or
[partnerstack](https://try.partnerstack.com/o6gmd069g0jf) are helpful.

LinkedIn Ads work once:

✅ You have product-market fit (using LinkedIn ads as a research channel is
very expensive if you have not nailed your target audience, core offer, price
point, or value proposition yet)

✅Your target audience is active on LinkedIn (active is important since just
because you can target them, does not mean they actively use the network, and
thus see your ads)

✅ACV > $8.000 (LinkedIn ads can be quite expensive and sales cycles quite
long, so it is important that your pricing can support this investment)

✅A decent website or landing page that already converts

✅Minimum monthly budget of $3.000 over 3 months (CPCs are high, and exposing
your audience to different messages and impacting the buyer journey takes
time)

✅You have other marketing channels that are performing (SEA, SEO, Email,
Affiliates, Organic Social), and you use LinkedIn ads as part of your overall
marketing strategy, not as the sole driver

✅Your LinkedIn company page is well set up

💡 We covered [LinkedIn Ads step-by-step](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/how-to-
get-started-with-linkedin).

The goal is to use the influencer’s credibility and reach to promote your SaaS
product.

Depending on the influencer/creators’ audience, this might be promoted content
on Substack, YouTube, LinkedIn, X…

Be present at events where your ICP hangs out. Niche fairs and events can be a
great lead generation channel.

Building relationships with media, influencers, and bloggers to generate
awareness through earned media coverage, press releases, and thought
leadership.

Backlinks from high-value domains also boost your SEO.

Under partnerships, you can find 3 main sub-categories. All leverage third
parties to promote your business.

  * Strategic Partnerships: Collaborating with complementary software providers.

  * Integration marketing: Co-marketing with your integration partners.

  * Partner Programs: Includes referral and reseller programs.

Similar to paid channels, you use existing communities (where your ICP hangs
out) to get in touch with them.

P.S. Communities can/might be even a relevant primary GTM channel, especially
if you operate in a rather crowded established market.
