[Joel York](http://chaotic-flow.com/media/saas-growth-strategy.pdf) defines
the growth of a SaaS company in the following:

> **SaaS Growth = Acquisition Rate x Average Customer Lifetime Value**

That means you can influence/optimize your SaaS growth by optimizing at least
one of the following parts:

  1. **Net Growth New Customers:**

… Adding more new customers (new customer growth)

… Reduce churn of customers (churn rate)

  2. **Average Revenue per Account (ARPA)**

… Upselling & Cross-selling

… Pricing

  3. **Customer Lifetime (Churn Rate)**

… or simply said by **a) adding new customers** , **b) reducing the loose of
existing customers (churn)** , and **c) increasing the revenue per customer.**

When you’re launching your business, it’s recommended to start with the
**market** (knowing the problems), then define your **ideal customer profile**
(who has the problem) and decide on how you want to position yourself in the
market (**Positioning**). Based on the segment of the market (and your
positioning) you decide how you’re hunting the ICP (**Sales strategy**) and
how you solve the problem (**Product Strategy**) and what’s in for them
(**Value Proposition**). Based on that you decide what you actually say to
your audience (**Brand Message, Sales Messaging**). Last but not least you
test and master different ways to get in touch with your potential customers
(**Growth Channels**).

TK Kader describes in his [5-Point SaaS Growth Strategy
Guide](https://offers.tkkader.com/optin-440522311603658290622) the success of
SaaS companies is based on 3 core elements:

  1. the market strategy

  2. the product strategy

  3. the go-to-market strategy

Let’s use those 3 to give the worksheet a good structure and add Measuring
Success as part #4.

  1. What is happening/changing in the market (macro trend) right now? Why do your customers need to care (now) about your product? What is happening on a higher level in the market?

  2. What is the FIUU (frequent, important, urgent, underserved) problem you’re going to solve? Be specific!

  3. Market Segmentation & Positioning of your company:

3.1. What is the segment of the market you go after?

3.2. How do you position yourself in the (competitive) market?

3.3. What does the competitive landscape look like? Where do you position
yourself?

3.4. Is it a red ocean (existing market with demand & competition) or a blue
ocean (create demand in the market & little/no competition)?

  4. [Product Adoption Curve](https://userpilot.com/blog/product-adoption-curve-saas/)

4.1. Who are you selling to (within the market segment)? Which stage in the
Product Adoption Curve are you targeting (right now).

4.2. What is the overall awareness for your product (completely new vs.
existing market)?

4.3. How much do you need to educate the market?

  5. Who exactly has this problem? Who is your [ideal customer](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-powerful-ideal-customer) profile (ICP I)? Follow the steps below to get a better picture and come up with a clearly defined ICP.

5.1. Your ICP combines “Pain + Fit + Readiness”.

… What’s the pain your ICP feels?

5.5.2. Use the [Dream 100 Concept (by Russell
Brunson)](https://www.clickfunnels.com/blog/the-dream-100/) to identify where
your ICP hangs out? Write down…

… The top 30+ content they consume (podcasts, newsletters, blogs, Youtube

  6. Get specific and create your [Dream 100](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-powerful-ideal-customer) customers list (no fictional companies!). The Dream 100 List concept was originated by Chet Holmes – [The Ultimate Sales Machine](https://amzn.to/3LsNbtj).

  7. Who are the ones within your ideal customer profile you can win first? (relevant for launching your business)

in all your customer-facing communication (Sales Message). All of the content
in your ads, website, emails, sales calls, social media posts, etc. rely on
them.

  1. [Brand Message](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/go-to-market-strategy-8-steps-for?s=w): A great starting point for powerful brand messaging can be [the Golden Circle (WHY/HOW/WHAT) of Simon Sinek.](https://simonsinek.com/commit/the-golden-circle)

scale with your customers?
