In previous episodes, we’ve talked about:

However, Elvin & Machiel have worked with hundreds of founders and helped many
hire their first GTM talent (predominantly on the sales side). They’ve noticed
a few common mistakes most founders make in this process.

A topic that I also face a lot when working with founders building their GTM
foundation.

So we decided to join forces and write a guide on the 9 most common hiring
mistakes (for the first GTM hires).

Let’s understand what exactly happens when you set out to build your first GTM
org.

As a founder, you might be great at selling your solution, but transitioning
out of sales and creating a successful, replicable, scalable motion with a
team is often challenging.

This is the part where founders get many concepts wrong and make costly
mistakes due to inexperience in [GTM
strategy](https://alexestner.gumroad.com/l/saas-growth-worksheet), process
setting, and execution.

This is especially true for first-time and technical founders who have limited
prior GTM experience.

In the visual below, you see the 6 phases of Founder-Led Sales (by [Seth
DeHart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sethdehart/), creator of [the
founderledsales community](http://www.joinfounderledsales.com)), where you can
see that **hiring is a key aspect of it**.

So, to make sure you master founder-led sales, we want you to prevent the most
common hiring mistakes.

That’s why today, we will uncover the 9 most common mistakes that founders
should avoid when it comes to hiring the first GTM team for your SaaS startup.

Let’s dive right in!

Before we go into hiring the right salespeople, we need to make sure we have
the right internal methods in place for better execution.

Often, sales reps are hired to try and replicate the founders’ success,
however, this often fails. Sales Methods are introduced for a reason.

Your way of doing sales as a founder might seem structured to you, but it’s
hard to replicate. Many startups fail because they operate without a
structured sales methodology!

**Why does this happen?**

Your way of doing sales is hard to replicate

⇩

You miss a common framework

⇩

It’s harder to measure performance

⇩

You won’t have insights into what works and what doesn’t

⇩

Coaching is ineffective

⇩

Scaling becomes harder

**How can you fix it?**

You should choose a proven sales methodology that aligns with your business
model -

✅ High-velocity sales motions for SMBs can go for SPICED or SPIN selling,

✅ Complex sales motions selling to enterprises can go for MEDDPICC, Command of
The Message, and The Challenger Sale.

Once you have a sales method in place, you can take the following steps:

✅ Train all sales reps consistently on it to ensure alignment

✅ Implement it in your CRM to measure performance and understand conversions

✅ Integrate the methodology into onboarding and ongoing training.

After doing this, onboarding, training, and coaching become more effective, as
you can now teach sales reps HOW to do sales in your organization.
Additionally, the data on your process will now become a baseline for further
improvement areas in the sales process.

💡ProTip: Add sales call recording tools (e.g., TLDV, Fireflies, Gong, Chorus)
to analyze top-performance behaviors and implement this back into the sales
process to optimize it.

Once you have a process in place, you’ll start having repeatability and
predictability, but don’t let this trigger you into setting overambitious
quotas. When targets are too high, even great sales reps will feel discouraged
and leave you for more achievable opportunities..

**❌ Overambitious quotas have the opposite effect of a higher level of
revenue.**

Sales reps get stressed out, and prospects feel this pressure. Conversions
drop, and churn increases, resulting in lower commissions and unhappy sales
reps. Eventually, this leads to employee churn and leaves your company with
less revenue.

**How to fix your quota?**

✅ The general rule of thumb is to set targets that are 3-5x the OTE, (but this
is too simple to just state without understanding all aspects of your
organization that affect this)

✅ Base quota on past data, not investor expectations

✅ Balance stretch goals with achievable targets (modern benchmarks suggest 80%
of reps should hit quota)

✅ Provide a clear path to success, and equip your reps with the required
leads, tools, and coaching

This is better for team morale, which, again, is felt by prospects. The result
is a higher close rate, more revenue, and a great amount of time and money
saved by not having to replace your team.

💡Pro Tip: In the early stages, giving a flat % over closed revenue and not
setting targets can help create great momentum without unnecessary pressure.
This also allows you to create valuable data over time, on which you can
create more structure for goals and commission models.

Hiring the right first salesperson for your business can have a multiplier
effect, while hiring the wrong first salesperson creates the opposite effect.

Getting this first profile correct is fundamental and will save you.

**Let’s start with what** _**not**_**to look for in a pioneer or founding
AE:**  

❌ **1\. Profiles that come from big companies (e.g., Salesforce, Oracle, SAP,
Microsoft, Cisco)**

These AEs are used in structured environments and for great sales enablement.
They won’t find this in your organization and are typically not
entrepreneurial self-starters. They struggle in unstructured early-stage
environments and are often set in their way, trained on a specific playbook
that might not work in your sales motion

**Instead, you should look for an AE who -**

✅ Has **startup experience**.

Know what it means to work in an early-stage environment.

✅ Can **prospect from scratch (full sales cycle)** , not just close inbound
leads.

Does what it takes to close customers. It’s more about testing different
things and building early sales playbooks.

✅ Has a**strong track record** in building pipeline

You can’t invest in teaching them. So invest in someone who did it before.

✅ Is a **Challenger Seller**

Someone who can meet customers wherever they are in their buying journey and
educate them. Someone who can consult and evangelize your solution.

✅ Has **grit, adaptability** , and a strong work ethic (prioritize this over
**industry experience)**

Being early-stage is tough. Lots of Nos. Sometimes buggy products. No existing
brand power. Find someone who can push through.

✅ Has a **strong willingness to build** , test, and execute

You don’t know everything. Look for someone who wants to build first sales
playbook with you.

In case you have already hired one, **here are a few signs of the[wrong first
sales person](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/7-bad-signs-of-a-wrong-first-
sales):**

❌ **1\. Lack of product knowledge**

A lot of (senior) sales reps, if they start working in an early-stage start-
up, don't really understand the product. They do not take enough time to
understand the customer's perspective and challenges, nor to create a value-
selling strategy. Make sure your first sales rep spends enough time
understanding the product (& the customer).

❌ **2\. Not willing to become an industry expert**

This point is closely related to point 1. If your sales rep is not willing to
dive deep into the industry, gain know-how about the specifics, and become an
industry expert, that's a bad sign.

❌ **3\. Not keen on building an industry network**

Word of mouth, warm intros, high-touch relationships with customers, and
referral marketing are key growth strategies in the early stage. That's why it
is super important that your customer-facing employees (sales, customer
success, support & marketing) grow their industry-relevant network.

❌ **4\. Always sells with massive discounts**

Only being able to sell with massive discounts is a sign of a lack of sales
skills. Most sales reps use discounts because they have no other idea how to
close a deal or create urgency. Make sure your first sales rep knows about
value-based selling/solution selling, so they find other ways to convince the
customers.

❌ **5\. Competition focused**

The wrong sales reps spend too much time comparing with the competition and
blaming missing product features for unsuccessful sales performance. The best
salespeople know the competition well and can adapt their pitch to the
competition if needed. For good sales reps, competition is just part of the
game, and they want to beat them.

❌ **6\. Lacks accountability & blames others**

Wrong sales reps blame others, and they miss accountability for hitting their
goals. Mostly, they blame marketing, product, or support. Even if this is
usually true, it's a bad sign.

❌ **7\. Missing growth mindset**

Early-stage sales is a tough game. Mostly, you try to convince customers of an
early (buggy) MVP. You need to be creative, smart, and always find new ways.
Great salespeople have a growth mindset.

Sales reps who worked in start-ups or scale-ups are comfortable with ambiguity
and a lack of process. They can even help shape your sales strategy and
process (if they’ve been taught in previous experiences). They can lay the
groundwork for your repeatability and are fine with both executing and
building at the same time.  

Some examples of profiles that embody these characteristics and skills;

We’ve seen many founders hire a sales leader as their first GTM hire to have
someone build the strategy and the processes, and this often fails.

This is because there isn’t a repeatable process yet, and even a great Head or
VP of Sales will struggle without a clear product-market fit.  

Too often, sales leaders haven’t been hands-on for a while, they typically try
to hire AEs and build the strategy and process in parallel. This is a costly
approach.

What can you do instead?

✅ First, hire individual contributors (Account Executives) who can validate
the sales process.

✅ Once sales reps consistently hit quota, bring in a leader to scale the team.

✅ If needed, hire a fractional VP of Sales for guidance without a full-time
commitment first.

💡Pro Tip: A Pioneer AE can be well-equipped to help build the sales
process/motion and can be a great operating addition to a GTM advisor. Many
pioneer/founding AEs don’t look for a fancy leadership title. They love to get
stuck in deals and go the business-building way, which might naturally develop
them into future leaders of your business.

When you hire your first commercial leader, don’t hire someone too strategic.
You don’t need someone full of high-level ideas in your early stages. You need
a hands-on executor who can get things done.

In short, you don’t need a strategist, you need an executor**.** Why? Because
a strategy without execution slows down sales growth. CCOs or CRO’s don’t want
to get hired to operate sales themselves, regardless of how hands-on they are.

They come in once there’s an established repeatable process in place and a
solid product-market fit that can be scaled. They bring cross-functional
expertise and can align market, sales, and CS when they are working with more
mature teams.

In your early stages, a GTM advisor or fractional VP can have the same effect
without giving away the C-level position to a more permanent hire down the
line.

**Here’s what you should do:**

✅ Hire a Head of Sales or VP who can build, implement, test, and iterate.

✅ Make sure your early-stage Sales Leader is able to sell and scale before you
bring in a CRO.

✅ Look for candidates with execution-driven experience, not just high-level
strategy.

✅ Ask HOW questions -

  * How did you implement that strategy/process?

  * How did you pick that strategy/process?

  * How did you get it from 0 to 1 - 1-5M+?

  * How did you test, adjust, and scale it?

If their answers stay high-level or sound like something a mid-level manager
executed, you’ve got a strategist. If they can they walk you through the
specific steps they took? That’s your executor.

Companies often try to save money by hiring cheaper, less experienced
salespeople.  
The truth is, whether or not you think salespeople are overpaid, it’s
completely irrelevant.

In the end, you need to pay what the market is paying, or you won’t be able to
attract the right talent.  

This matters because the best salespeople deliver significantly better
results, making them worth the investment. Additionally, you don’t risk losing
your reps to better-paying offers out there.  

**What can you do about it?**

✅ Pay market-competitive salaries to attract top talent.

✅Avoid rigid salary structures that prevent hiring top talent - if a sales rep
can’t calculate their commission, your comp plan is too complex.

💡Pro-Tip: Use ROI calculations to justify higher pay (e.g., a top salesperson
can exceed targets by 20% on 600K and bring in 120K or more, which would mean
they bring in more money and can cost a bit more as well)

Speed in the hiring process matters more than you think**.**

You can be the best in terms of salary, product, growth rate, and internal
processes, but top candidates might still pick a different option over you
because _it takes you too long to hire, losing strong candidates to faster-
moving competitors._

The best candidates get multiple offers within weeks. Especially, SDRs with
good academia and sales acumen typically have several offers to entertain and
have the luxury to pick. The same goes for strong AE profiles, even more so
when they have the pioneering ability.  

This is the most common mistake, yet it’s the easiest to fix:

✅ Manage expectations - define a clear hiring process and communicate it.
Don’t exceed 5 steps in the process (3-4 steps are ideal)

✅ Simplify decision-making with a clear scoring system

✅ Balance thoroughness with urgency—move fast without skipping key evaluation
steps.

✅ Be fast and transparent in updating candidates on next steps - don’t let
them wait 1+ week for feedback

✅Use stakeholders (like recruiters) to keep candidates engaged if you need
more time to compare different candidates

💡Pro-Tip: When you feel like you’re speaking to a superstar after the first
interview, schedule all rounds immediately. This speeds up the process
tremendously. If the candidate does the next interview poorly, you can still
cancel the other interviews.

Founders are the best people to sell the vision, they are the ones to close
the first deals and build the first levels of repeatability in their sales
cycle. They keep the product team informed about customer feedback and provide
tons of value in exchange for revenue with customers. Yet, Founders often
assume they should stop selling after hiring their first sales reps, as for
many founders, sales might not come naturally and can be a frustrating
process.  

However, when things fall apart in sales, and the founders are not involved,
it is still their responsibility. They have to stay close to the sales team,
or they’d take too much risk when revenue starts to slip. You need to stay
involved and keep a pulse on the ever-evolving product-market fit.  

Tips to balance out your involvement in sales as a founder

✅ Founders should remain engaged in high-stakes deals and key partnerships.

✅ They must ensure product-market fit before handing off sales completely and
remain close to the customer to understand what changes.

✅ Develop a transition plan where sales leadership gradually takes over.

✅ Once you have success, have a sales leader in place - only then can you
start being less involved as a founder.

While the right skill sets and experience are super important, attributes like
cultural fit and passion are not less important. It's crucial to assess
candidates holistically to ensure they align with your company's values and
mission.
