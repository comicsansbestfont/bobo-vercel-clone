We all agree that prospecting to referred leads (aka. warm leads) is easier
and more effective than cold prospecting.

‘Warm’ leads have a higher trust in you and therefore show higher win rates.

A great opportunity to get these ‘warm intros’ are all your interactions with
your existing customers and also prospects (people you are selling to right
now) - **It’s called Referral sales.**

The goal of referral sales is getting your existing customers (and prospects)
to give you contact information (ideally including introductions) of other
relevant leads in their network, plus using their names when contacting the
new leads.

But if you are successful in getting referrals and intros to other relevant
leads depends a lot on HOW you ask them.

That’s why I’ve created some blurbs that you can use straight away.

Here are 3 ways how to get more intros/referrals:

> “ _Okay, thanks for the demo. I see that (your company name) is probably not
> a good fit for you. But now that you know who we work with
> (your[ICP](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/framework-ideal-
> customer-profile)) and what our product can do for them, who are 2-3 other
> companies/people you think can benefit from it?_”

…and then if they tell you some names, respond the following:

> “ _Thanks. Would you mind making an email intro for me? If you want, I can
> also send you an intro template to make it easier for you_ ”.

> “ _Okay, thanks for the demo. Great to see that (your company name) is a
> good fit for you. Now that you know who we work with
> (your[ICP](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/framework-ideal-
> customer-profile)) and what our product can do for companies like you, who
> are 2-3 other companies/people you think can benefit from it, too?_”

…and then if they tell you some names, respond the following:

> “ _Thanks. Would you mind making an email intro for me? If you want, I can
> also send you an intro template to make it easier for you_ ”.

> “ _Great to hear that you are happy with the product. Now that you know what
> impact (your company name) has on you, who are 2-3 other companies/people
> you think can benefit from it, too?_ ”

…and then if they tell you some names, respond with the following:

> “ _Thanks. Would you mind making an email intro for me? If you want, I can
> also send you an intro template to make it easier for you_ ”.

Bonus:

If you want to increase the chance that they refer you to other companies,
make it easy for them.

So instead of asking “… _who are 2-3 other companies/people you think can
benefit from it, too?”_ you can do your research upfront (e.g. LinkedIn
connections) and find leads that fit your ICP and are somehow connected to
them.

You could ask

> “ _…I saw that you are connected with X and Y. Based on my research, I
> believe they could benefit from our tool as well. Would you mind making an
> email intro for me?”._

It’s all about the mindset. Once you realize that you can turn every customer
interaction into an opportunity to get intros, you can explore the same
strategies for Cold Calls, Onboarding Meetings, Customer Support Calls,
Product Calls, etc. - it also works of course via email conversations.

Here is a quick summary of how to be successful with referral sales:

✅ Ask for referrals throughout your sales process

✅ Make referring easy

✅ Use blurbs to ask the right way

Being successful with Content Marketing consists of 5 steps:

  1. Content Research

  2. Content Planning

  3. Content Creation

  4. Content Distribution

  5. Content Optimization (for SEO)

Most early-stage founders know the importance of Content Marketing as one (or
primary) growth channel in the early days. Creating valuable content creates
trust and puts you and your company as a thought leader.

But here’s the thing: It’s not enough to ‘just’ create content, publish (the
long-form) content on your blog, and then hope for the best.

Distribution of the content is neglected by most founders. I would even say
that the distribution part is as important as the creation part.

So to be successful with content marketing you need to focus on all 5 (to
begin with the first 4) steps.

It all starts with getting to know your ICP (if you don’t know what this is,
check out my Ultimate ICP Guide). Jump on customer interviews and learn about
their status quo, challenges, pains, and desired outcomes.

Learn about your ICP by joining relevant communities or online platforms where
your audience hangs out.

Follow thought leaders on social media and learn from them.

your own Miro account). That’s why I published them on Miroverse.
