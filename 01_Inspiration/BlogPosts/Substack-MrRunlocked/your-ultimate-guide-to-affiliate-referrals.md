  5. Closing Thoughts

In the fast-moving world of B2B SaaS, affiliate referrals are quickly becoming
key to growth. With a market value exceeding $17 billion in 2023
([Google](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2015-01-01%202023-07-31&q=affiliate%20marketing)),
experts predict it could reach $40 billion by 2030
([Astuteanalytica](https://www.astuteanalytica.com/industry-report/affiliate-
marketing-platform-market)).

Not surprisingly, more than 81% of brands are already applying these growth
loops (Statista). What works incredibly well, especially in B2C e-com, remains
untapped for B2B SaaS.

This guide aims to demystify affiliate referrals, offering practical advice,
tested strategies, and innovative approaches designed specifically for high-
growth B2B SaaS companies.

Whether you're starting from scratch or looking to improve your existing
program, this guide will provide the answers you need:

  * Does an affiliate program make sense for me and my product?

  * What types of affiliate referrals exist, and what are the pros and cons?

  * How to launch an affiliate referral program?

  * How and where to identify affiliates?

  * How to promote an affiliate program?

  * How to scale and maintain it?

  * What are KPIs to look for?

We generally distinguish between user referrals and partner referrals.
Affiliate referrals are a subcategory of partner referrals.

Types of Referrals: Partner & User Referrals (Source: Cello)

If we take one step back and look at the theoretical foundation of growth
loops Casey Winter and Kevin Kwok defined affiliate referrals as a subtype of
Paid Growth Loops.

New user sign-ups generate revenue and are reinvested in ads or content
suppliers or partners distribute. The primary fuel of this loop is revenue.

different growth loops (Source: Cello)

Based on this theoretical foundation, we can define affiliate referrals as a
growth channel where businesses incentivize external partners (affiliates) to
promote their products or services to a broader audience.

These affiliates, from individuals to companies, earn a commission or other
rewards for each customer or sale they generate through their referral links.

Now that you understand what affiliate referrals are, let’s have a closer look
at what’s in it for you.

Affiliate referrals aim to leverage **cost-effective, scalable growth**.

This approach taps into the networks of trusted affiliates to **increase
product visibility** and **credibility** , driving **targeted leads** and
**conversions**.

With affiliates generally paid on a performance basis, it ensures **zero
payback time** and a **high ROI** by focusing expenditure on proven results.

Moreover, it **enhances brand reach within niche markets** through partners
with established audiences, facilitating efficient market penetration and
customer acquisition with minimal upfront costs.

Some stats in a nutshell:

  * As of May 19, 2023, affiliate programs drove 16% of all online orders in the United States ([Demandsage](https://www.demandsage.com/affiliate-marketing-statistics/))

  * A good 65% of retailers see up to a 20% increase in yearly revenue through affiliate marketing. Nearly 60% of merchants make $5 million, showing great revenue potential with good affiliate marketing strategies([Demandsage](https://www.demandsage.com/affiliate-marketing-statistics/))

  * More than 80% of brands use affiliate marketing programs, allocating around 10% of their marketing budget to it ([Forrester](https://docplayer.net/21537988-Networks-help-drive-affiliate-marketing-into-the-mainstream-advertisers-and-publishers-evolve-as-the-industry-shifts.html))

  * B2B affiliate programs account for 40.68% of all affiliate programs used by marketers, with SaaS products paying the highest commissions ([Authorityhacker](https://www.authorityhacker.com/affiliate-marketing-statistics/))

Before we try to understand if affiliate referrals are for you, let’s have a
deep dive into the most prominent types of affiliates and see which type of
company is most suited for them.

We generally see the following 2 emerging forms of affiliate referrals.

  1. **Affiliate content creators** : Online content creators who place affiliate links into their copy, visuals, or podcasts.

  2. **Affiliate hubs** : Specialized websites that provide access to affiliates or enable affiliate link listings.

The below overview compares various subcategories of these two affiliate forms
(the list is non-exhaustive) and indicates which one could work best for you.

Let’s move on and see whether an affiliate program is right for you.

Deciding if an affiliate referral program is right for your B2B SaaS company
hinges on the product's nature, complexity, and market fit.

**Low to Medium Friction Products** : These products are easily accessible
(freemium or free trial product access), making them ideal for affiliate
marketing. Affiliates can effectively communicate the product's benefits,
appealing to a broad audience.

**High-Friction Products or Narrow Audiences** : These products face
challenges due to their complexity or niche target market. Achieving success
through affiliate marketing requires more effort, including significant
upfront investment in affiliate education and a more time-consuming go-to-
market strategy, relying heavily on the affiliates' influence and expertise.
Choosing the right affiliate (s. Sourcing & Acquiring section) could still
result in program success.

**Trend-driven products:** It's noteworthy that affiliates typically see a
47.16% higher earning from selecting products based on trends rather than
commission rates or personal insights
([Authorityhacker](https://www.authorityhacker.com/affiliate-marketing-
statistics/)). This aligns with the initial point about the widespread appeal
of AI tools among today's affiliates.

**Natural limitation:** Be aware that growth and scalability through
affiliates might be naturally limited due to a shortage of suitable affiliates
for your product.

In essence, while affiliate programs can significantly boost growth, their
effectiveness varies based on product accessibility and audience specificity.

We’ve covered the theoretical foundation; let’s get more tactical and learn
how to set up an affiliate program in 6 steps.

of launching a successful affiliate program (Source: Cello)

_**Incentive structure:**_

  * **Pay-per-click** : The affiliate gets a reward for every successful unique click on a referral link

  * **Pay-per-lead** : The affiliates get a reward for an inbound lead or a specific event

  * **Pay-per-sales** : The affiliates get a percentage of the revenue generated by new paid customers

 _**Allocate the right budget:**_

Between 20% to 70% commission is typically paid to SaaS affiliates
(authorityhacker). The right budget depends on:

  1. Average [Customer Lifetime Value](https://cello.so/what-is-a-clv-customer-lifetime-value/) (CLV):

  2. Profit Margins

  3. Market Competition

  4. Program Management Costs

  5. Estimated Acquisition through Affiliates

  6. Trial and Error

 _**Other key variables to consider:**_

The landing page should include:

✅Benefits and structure of your program

✅Your reward model

✅Payout terms (e.g. referral-based, one-off, lifetime)

✅Sign up form

✅Provide an affiliate partner kit (great example
[tl;dv](https://tldv.notion.site/tl-dv-Media-
Kit-86d1ac575adc405d8fb2cf4393b8c54d))

ba63-c7f929092afc_1600x856.png)Include a clear value-proposition on the
product + trust elements (Source:
[Fellow](https://fellow.app/partners/ambassadors/))

A few recommended tactics are:

  * Announcements on your **social accounts** , **blog** , and **communities**

  * Embed website **top-of-the-page banner** highlighting your new partner program 

  * **Main navigation** and footer backlinks should lead to your partner page 

  * Encourage **existing partners to share** on their social about their program participation

  * Dedicated **newsletter** and/or inclusion in your nurture emails about the program 

  * Include the affiliate program on your employee’s profiles and email signature

Once your affiliate is live, you need to keep track of:

✅Affiliate partner communication & performance

✅Affiliate dashboard

✅Payouts

✅Legal, tax & compliance

Tracking input and output metrics allows you to decide if affiliate programs
are a good fit for your GTM strategy (--> [Free GTM

of important affiliate referral program KPIs (Source: Cello)

Affiliate referral programs have the potential to be a significant growth
channel.

A few criteria that define success::

  * Product complexity & market fit

  * Structure of the affiliate program

  * Availability of suited potential affiliates

  * Your ability to enable & engage your affiliates

  * Your ability to scale the program

Finally, don’t forget the synergies between user referrals and affiliate
referrals. Layer [user referrals](https://cello.so/complete-guide-to-
your-b2b-referral-program/) on top of affiliates once you have reached a
significant monthly active user base (e.g. >1,000 MAUs).
