You can market the exact same product in different ways. That’s what we call
Positioning.

It’s a fundamental element of your [GTM
strategy.](https://alexestner.gumroad.com/l/saas-growth-worksheet)

Rob Walling made a very actionable video on the different types of
positioning.

1️⃣ **Niche down**

Finding an (underserved) segment of the market and building the best tool for
them.

Most of the time it's vertical-specific tools.

Examples: Resource management software for the public sector
([locaboo.com](https://www.locaboo.com/)) or banking account for freelancers
([kontist.com](https://kontist.com/))

**2️⃣ Low-cost player**

Mostly in a more crowded market when market leaders increase their prices (a
lot), you have the chance to build a low-cost version of it.

Best for PLG products.

Examples: Cheaper alternatives to market leaders like Salesforce, Intercom,
Adobe

**3️⃣ Premium-player**

Serve clients that need more human touch (customer service, sales demos...).
You can position yourself as the premium player. Mostly more connected to the
enterprise segment.

**4️⃣ Unique benefit**

You have something very unique that no one else has.

This can be a specific feature or the fact that you serve a specific market
better (e.g. being GDPR compliant, if you sell to DACH market)

Examples: GDPR-compliant alternative to Mailchimp
([www.cleverreach.com](https://www.cleverreach.com/))

**5️⃣ Being the 'lite' version of something complex**

You serve a customer segment that doesn't need the heavy, complex market
leader (e.g. Salesforce or Adobe).

You're building a lightweight version.

Examples: [Pipedrive](https://www.pipedrive.com/) being the lite alternative
to Salesforce

**6️⃣ Mix of the above**

Of course, each of the elements can be mixed. Lite player, niche player and
low cost player and work quite well hand in hand. Also niching down and having
a unique benefit can be very powerful.

Knowing the pain points of your
[ICP](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-powerful-
ideal-customer) is crucial for a [powerful
messaging](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/hit-message-market-
fit-b2b-saas-startup). You should not only use these pieces of information in
your [sales demos](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-
guide-to-sales-product-demos), they should rather be a central element of all
your customer-facing communication - including your website.

[Encharge.io](https://encharge.io/use-cases/trial-conversion-for-saas-
startups/) made an outstanding job on its website, highlighting the

Two sections that make your website more compelling by showcasing the
transformation your product can bring to your customers' businesses.

Try the BEFORE and AFTER sections.

**1️⃣ BEFORE using your product (the shitty Status Quo):**

🔸 Frustration and dissatisfaction with their current solution

🔸 Inefficient and outdated processes

🔸 Loss of time and resources due to manual work

🔸 Limited growth and revenue due to poor performance

🔸 the list goes on, depending on your product

**2️⃣ AFTER switching to your solution (the dream outcome):**

🔸 Increased productivity and efficiency

🔸 Streamlined processes and workflows

🔸 Significant time and cost savings

🔸 Rapid growth and improved revenue

These two sections can help your website stand out and demonstrate the true
value of your product.

You are sending out 4-5 emails in a sequence and don’t get any responses?

A simple tip to get more email responses to your follow-up emails is adding
value to your follow-ups 🎉

**Here are a few examples of how this could look like 👇**

🔸 Provide some additional information (that was missing in your previous
emails, e.g. a video of how your product can help them)

🔸 Share some helpful resources that might be helpful to them (your latest blog
post, some youtube video, or Linkedin post)

🔸 Some specific tips about their business (e.g. how they can improve their
website copy or Linkedin posts)

🔸 Invitation to your upcoming webinar or event - as a guest or even speaker?

🔸 Sharing industry news

The list goes on.

It's not about "What' exactly you share.

As long as it's "valuable" to them.

P.S. The P.S. section is a great place to put your "value".
