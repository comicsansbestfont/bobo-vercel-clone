If you want your great product to be used by lots of customers and ultimately
grow your business, you need to know how to market your SaaS product.

In this blog, I’ve put together 22 powerful B2B SaaS Marketing tips that will
help you to get more leads (signups or MQL) and convert them to more paying
customers.

Make sure to also check out [22 powerful B2B SaaS Sales tips to win more
deals](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/b2b-saas-sales-tips).

If you really know who your ideal customer profile is, what they care about,
what their jobs to be done are, where they hang out, what they read, and what
they want to achieve, you will know what kind of product you need to build,
how to communicate the values, where to promote it, and how much you can
charge for it.

Get clear on your [ideal customer profile
(ICP](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-powerful-
ideal-customer)) and speak specifically to them. What it means is that your
copy shouldn’t speak to everyone, actually, it’s great if you exclude 99% of
the market. Being relevant to your ICP means that you should address their
pain points, challenges, goals as well as objections. Make use of the ‘Jobs to
be done’ (see tip #3), talk about how your product solves their pain points (=
your value proposition & results), and also speak/write in the language of
your customers (they need to understand you, otherwise they don’t signup for
your product).

This means all your [customer-facing
messaging](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-
framework) (e.g. website copy, emails, newsletter, whitepaper…) needs to speak
to your specific audience.

Write to one person when you are creating your
[content](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-content-marketing-guide).

Jobs to be done are what your customer is trying to achieve. And your product
(hopefully) helps them to accomplish the jobs (or at least makes it faster,
cheaper, better, easier…).

So the Jobs to be done framework consists of 2 parts - the current situation
and the desired outcome. Make sure to not only focus on the functional jobs
but also on the emotional and social aspects.

  * Emotional — how do your customers feel when the job is done

  * Functional — what do your customers actually do when they do the job (actions taken)

  * Social — how are your customers perceived when they do the job

Learn about what they are trying to achieve in their role. For what are
potential customers ‘hiring’ your product for? And what would a dream product
allow them to do?

Here are some examples:

  * CMO = Getting enough leads for the sales team

  * HR Director = Increase employee satisfaction and hire fast

  * VP Sales = Meet the sales targets and increase revenue

  * Customer Success = High customer satisfaction (NPS score)

In the early stage, it’s all about [testing different growth
channels](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-21-saas-gtm-channels) and
measuring what works and what does not. Stick to the best converting channels,
double down on them and stop with the others. Master one channel at a time
before you add more channels.

What are the platforms where your ICP hangs out? Which channels show the best
conversions? Not only track conversions but also measure the success of each
channel based on CACs and LTV (lifetime value). Maybe some channels are more
expensive than others but those customers decide on your premium product and
are happier and stay longer?

Most startups start with content marketing about topics/keywords with huge
traffic and are rather far away from making a decision (top of funnel).

If you are an early-stage startup, [start with content that is closer to
making a decision](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-content-
marketing-guide) (bottom of funnel) and outperforms your competition for this
traffic. Find keywords with rather low competition and high intent to buy.

Great examples are content around:

  * “[Competitor name] alternatives”

  * “[Software category] comparison“ (e.g. CRM tool for freelancer comparison)

  * “Best [Software category] tool“ (e.g. Best CRM for freelancer tool)

Also success stories, testimonials, and content about specific features are
great (e.g. How to automate your social media posts).

If you don’t fail, you probably didn’t try something new. Growth is about
trying new things, measuring, reflecting on them, and learning from them. It’s
about iterating and getting better every time.

What is valuable for your potential customers? Valuable content can be a great
source for lead magnets. Here are some inspirations:

With a strong lead magnet, you can grow your email list. Now it’s time to
nurture them and get them to test your product/book sales calls.

Be intentional about the call to action buttons on your website.

Normally if you’re following a [sales-led growth
strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-
saas-growth?s=w) you want potential customers to talk to your sales team
(’Talk to sales’ & ‘Book a call’). Following a [product-led
growth](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-
saas-growth?s=w), you want them to get started and test the product (“Free
trial” & “Signup for free”).

If you [target different segments of the
market](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile) (e.g.
prosumers and mid-market), segment the signups during the onboarding flow and
offer different customized experiences for them.

Some important things to remember for strong CTAs:

  * Make it clear what you want them to do and what they can expect doing so

  * Optimize the process ‘after’ the CTA (e.g. Calendly for Sales Demo Booking, Round Robin in CRM, Automated Email Follow-Up...)

  * Consistency in all your communication (Website, Email, Ads...) - of course, you should test different versions to see what’s working best

Also, remember to always add a clear CTA in all your outbound communication
(e.g. cold emails).

A frictionless signup process increases your conversion rates. It’s a lot
about great user experience and making it easy. If it’s complicated to get
started with your product, people drop out and barely come back. Things to
consider are:

  * Strong Call to Action on every page of your website

  * Collect only minimum data of information during signup (and collect contextual information later)

  * Split long signup forms into multiple steps (with the option to skip specific steps)

  * Add product tours & checklists to increase the activation rate

  * add social proof and a reminder of the value proposition on the signup page (to encourage them to really signup)

  * offer one-click signup via a third party (with Google or Microsoft account)

Have a lock at the signup process of successful SaaS companies like Hubspot,
Canva, Stripe, or Notion.

Add visual progress cues like progress bars, checklists, or even time
indicators to your onboarding flow. You will see that your activation rate
increases because new users want to know what they need to do next and how
much progress they already made.

Welcome email sequences are automated email marketing campaigns with the only
goal to get new signups to the next stage of your funnel (active users for
product-led or sales demos for sales-led growth), triggered automatically when
a new sign-up happens.

Draft the right emails based on your customer journey, but most successful
welcome email sequences are based on 5-10 emails. Keep the following in mind:

  * Personalize your welcome email (with information about the next steps, maybe even sent from the founder)

  * Always add a clear call-to-action to your emails

  * Compelling Subject Lines (no generic email subject lines)

  * Test simple plain email vs. fancy nice designed emails

  * Offer the option to reply to the email (or to make sure to also check them)

  * When writing the sequence, have a clear intention in mind for every email (based on your customer journey)

  * Think about the right triggers for the emails (what emails should be triggered based on user behavior (e.g. haven’t added specific information to the product after x days) vs. time-based (e.g. haven’t upgraded to paid plan 1 day before the end of free trial period).

  * Always restate your value proposition

If you are an early-stage startup, add some personalized emails sent by the
founder to your email sequences. The first email after signup (welcome email
#1), your trials expire (one of the last emails of your welcome email
sequence) and when someone churns, are great reasons why you as a founder
should reach out to your customers/prospects.

Some more inspirations:

  * Add a personal video message to your emails

  * Offer churned customers the option to give feedback about churn reasons (e.g. survey or even the option to book a feedback call with you)

  * Ask users that didn’t convert what’s missing/the reason for not converting

If you are selling to small and medium-sized businesses and have a rather
easy-to-understand product, think about a [product-led growth
strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-
saas-growth).

Make use of [the 4 types of viral features (network effects, value virality,
exposure virality, invites &
referrals](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/12-powerful-b2b-saas-
channels-for)) and [share your own thoughts about
it](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexander-estner_b2bsales-saasmarketing-
saas-
activity-6952639942116171776-7a4E?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web).

Great examples of viral features are:

  * Peer-to-peer payments (Paypal)

  * Scheduling (Calendly)

  * e-signature (Hellosign)

  * Emails (Mailchimp, Superhuman)

  * Education badges (Hubspot Academy)

  * Referral Codes (Uber, Dropbox)

Social proof is really powerful and great for trust-building. Show them how
successful they can get using your product (what results can they expect) and
underline them with social proof of existing customers. You can use
testimonials, e.g. quotes, testimonial videos, or success stories.

So make sure to add them at the relevant steps in the customer journey.
Examples where to add them:

P.S. Giving early customers a discount in exchange for a testimonial and case
study is super valuable for your growth.

Use easy language and the language of your customers to sell your product.
Avoid too technical terms and complicated acronyms, unless your ICP speaks
this language.

You don’t need to become an expert in the industry/field of your customers,
even though it for sure doesn’t hurt :) But at least you need to speak their
language, understand the basics, and know their terminology. Being aware of
industry-specific terminology increases your credibility.

All your content (e.g. website copy, help center articles, emails…) should be
written in the language your customers speak and should be easy to understand.

A conversational tone means you try to write the way you would normally talk
to your customer. You’re not trying to impress your customers with your
vocabulary (not too technical or industry jargon). Talk directly to the
visitor of your landing page, speak to one person and ask questions. Make sure
the language you choose fits your [target customer
persona](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile). A
conversational tone works better for products targeting consumers, prosumers,
and SMBs, not perfect for enterprise customers.

Once you defined a strong value proposition and key sales messaging, make sure
your communication on every channel is consistent. It’s so much more
convincing if the communication in your marketing ad, your sales demo, your
product onboarding video, etc. are all aligned and sell the same outcomes and
results (functional results vs. social results vs. emotional results).

80% of the visitors only read the headlines, and only 20% read the rest of
your landing page. So make sure you nailed your headlines. The headline
captures the attention of the visitors.

Here are some tips for headlines:

  * aim for 6 words headlines - keep them short

  * use dark (contrast) colors to make them easy to read

  * include strong words and adjectives

  * include (odd) numbers (e.g. 105% increase of revenue)

  * use action headlines (e.g. Get Free Access today)

  * add pain points and jobs to be done in the headline (your ICP will relate to it)

The advantage of referrals is, that it’s cheaper (lower CACs) and more
effective than acquiring new customers (higher conversion rates). Why? Because
happy customers refer others to you (for free or for a small referral bonus)
and they mostly refer peers to you (which is more likely your ICP).

But of course, you need to frequently ask your customers for referrals (plus
incentivize them to do so) to get the most out of this growth channel. Asking
for referrals works best:

  * if you ask your customers in a moment when they are positive about your product (e.g. high NPS score; positive customer success call; release of high requested feature…)

  * at the end of a (successful) sales call (but even if the product is not right for them, ask for referrals that would fit your product)

Important about a referral marketing program are customer segmentation, timing
& frequency, referral incentive, communication & messaging, and technical
implementation & tools. Learn more about effective referral marketing programs

channels-for?s=w).

Together both teams are responsible for the growth of the company - they just
focus on different parts of the funnel. But they rely on each other, so make
sure that they have a bigger, shared, and aligned objective that they work
towards together.

Otherwise, you will end up will lots of MQLs, but low conversion to SQLs and
Sales blaming marketing for unqualified leads and Marketing blaming Sales for
being bad in closing deals.

If you’re competing in a red ocean, you’re fighting to exploit existing demand
and be better than your competitors. It’s all about beating the competition
and harvesting the demand.

In a blue ocean, you’re creating demand. That means that you need to educate
the market first in order to create awareness and ultimately demand your
solution.

In B2B SaaS Tomasz Tunguz [says](https://tomtunguz.com/three-value-
propositions/)

> _“There are three kinds of software value propositions. Software
> that**increases revenue** , software that **reduces cost** , and software
> that promises **improved productivity**.”_

A strong sales message is when you add on top of the main value proposition
the results your product delivers. There are 3 types of results:

**Functional results.** Things or task your products make easier, faster, and
better (nice designs, better reporting, more leads, faster copywriting…).

**Emotional results.** How do your customers feel as a result of the
functional result (feeling professional, feeling smart, feeling well informed,
feeling relaxed…).

**Social results**. How your customers are perceived by others or how they see
themself compared to others (professional, smart, relevant…).
