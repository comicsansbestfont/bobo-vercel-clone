Quite frequently my friends, colleagues, mentees, and customers are asking me
the same one question: 'What digital tools and software solutions do you
highly recommend for running an online business, a digital start-up, or being
a digital creator.' And most of the time I've recommended the same tools to
them.

That's the reason why I have now summarized the best digital tools for
launching and running your (software) start-up in one easy-to-read table.

Please be aware that the definition of 'best tools' is obviously my subjective
opinion based on my experiences using them or implementing them for customers.

In the table below I've included tools for CRM, Marketing Automation, Website
Builder, Domain Hosting, Project Management, To-Do-Lists, Social Media
Management, Design, Online Course, Webinar, E-commerce, Scheduling,
Automation, Outsourcing/Freelancer, Surveys, File Storage and Password
Management. You can easily filter the table based on those categories.

For some of the categories, you will find more than one tool recommendation.
This means that I can highly recommend all of them and you should decide based
on your individual budget, specific feature requests, and personal preferences
for different user experiences.

[1 Password](https://1password.grsm.io/notionblogpost) makes it easy to manage
all your passwords in one secure place. I'm using 1Password privately and also
at work. It's easy to share passwords within the company with other employees.
With 1Password it's super easy to create and use passwords that are secure.
And all your passwords are synced between all your devices - mobile App (iOS
App & Android), Browser Extension, and Desktop App.

[Calendly](https://calendly.grsm.io/notion) makes scheduling meetings hassle-
free and eliminates back-and-forth emails to find a suitable date. Perfect for
scheduling product demo meetings with potential customers (Sales Demo), job
interviews with applicants, or just managing internal meetings. I personally
also like their automation features like meeting reminder emails and auto-
follow-up emails.

[Canva](http://partner.canva.com/alexnotion) lets you easily create nicely
designed social media posts, business cards, flyers, youtube thumbnails, and
more using professionally designed templates. For everyone who wants nice
designs for their website and social media, I can highly recommend Canva. With
Canva also non-designers can create beautiful designs (e.g. Instagram Posts or
Youtube Thumbnails), and it is super easy to learn.
