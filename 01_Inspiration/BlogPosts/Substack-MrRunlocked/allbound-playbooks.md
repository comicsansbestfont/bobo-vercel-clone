Before we deep-dive, let’s quickly talk about what Allbound is & why it’s
important, so we all have a common understanding.

Traditional pipeline generation, as companies have been doing for years, has
been changing, and two things are fueling this:

✅ **Trust** **has become important** for buyers when making a purchase
decision. Being a trusted expert in your field is a must-have.

✅ You must have heard this one quite a bit, but **“spray and pray”** **does
not work anymore**. You need to change your approach to outbound to make it
more relevant & personal than ever.

So, B2B SaaS companies face the following **challenges with traditional
Pipeline Generation tactics** :

❌ Not leveraging **personal brands** and **intent signals** systematically

❌ Inefficient manual list building instead of **evergreen campaigns**

❌**Poor lead quality** and targeting, causing low engagement rates

❌ Generic automated outreach lacking **personalization & relevance**

❌ Not leveraging **existing relationships** systematically

‘Allbound’ is an approach that tries to combine ‘Inbound’ and ‘Outbound’ into
one integrated approach to fix these challenges.

  1. Allbound combines both inbound and outbound sales approaches into one integrated system, instead of keeping these as separate channels with different teams. (marketing versus sales) fighting for attribution.

  2. Allbound marries typical top-of-funnel marketing activities (1-to-many communication) with mid-funnel activities typically handled by SDRs (1-to-1 communication).

  3. Allbound is leveraging AI and automation, ensuring SDRs can focus on the RIGHT leads while automating the bulk of their manual workload.

The three key components of a solid Allbound strategy are:

1️⃣ **Demand generation** initiatives that create real intent signals
(inbound)

2️⃣ **Signal** filter, scoring, and enrichment engine.

3️⃣ Relevant & personalized **outreach** (outbound)

To make this easy to understand, here is a simple example:

  1. The founder is posting on LinkedIn

  2. Person from target audience engages with the post (= low intent signal) and visits multiple website pages afterwards (= mid intent signal)

  3. These signals are tracked, and the founder is reaching out to this person with a personalized and relevant LinkedIn message based on the viewed website pages.

Allbound pipeline generation must always be tailored to your specific GTM
motion.

If you get this wrong, you can quickly burn through your Total Addressable
Market and close doors instead of opening them.

So let’s have a look at 3 Allbound fundamentals.

When you read B2B pipeline advice on LinkedIn, you'll find polar-opposed
opinions:

> _"Just closed 200k**through my network**. Shocking that human connections
> still work in 2025!"_

vs.

> _"My AI outbound system built 450k in pipeline**on autopilot**. Networks are
> overrated."_

The missing piece? GTM context.

Both approaches can work, but for entirely different GTM motions.

Different target customers and different ACVs require different engines (aka.
GTM tactics).

**The size of your deals (ACV) dictates how you approach your market.**

For small deals, you cannot afford to run a high-touch motion, whereas for
large deals, you often can and have to run a high-touch motion.

This is very important when you fine-tune and customize your allbound engine.

For example:

  * **In a low-touch allbound engine** : Website visitors are automatically approached with an automated email (after the AI qualifies them), whereas 

  * **In a high-touch allbound engine:** Website visitors are qualified by the AI, but typically only a task is created (supplemented with account research by AI agent) for the Account Executive to follow up and reach out very individually.

Similarly, if you create a lead magnet for your GTM motion, this is maybe an
ebook for a medium touch motion, but rather a very high-end, exclusive round
table with relevant executives for high touch motion (e.g. CTO in B2B SaaS
with engineering teams of +20 people in Germany).

Always look at pipeline generation advice through your very specific GTM-lens!

A second very important fundamental is that only a fraction of your Total
Addressable Market (TAM) is “in-market” (aka. actively looking for a solution
right now) today.

Picture a city of 100 potential prospects. On any given day, 95 of them are
not ready to buy because:

  * _"Our current setup works fine"_

  * _"Never heard of this solution"_

  * _"Just signed with someone else"_

  * _"Don't see this as a priority"_

The 5% buying today remember the brands they noticed BEFORE they were in-
market -Brand Awareness!

Why is this important?

**You want to stay top of mind with the 95% out-of-market buyer and leverage
(intent) signals to know when they go from “out of market” to “in market”.**

So (intent) signals are the best proxies to know when your target audience is
ready to buy.

Yes, the reality is a bit more complex. The gist remains the same: keep top of
mind for the 95% that are not buying today and understand when they start
actively researching solutions.

The traditional SDR model: cold calling, emailing, list-building, and
qualifying prospects, is outdated and leads to several inefficiencies:

  * **Time waste:** Up to 70% of an SDR’s time goes to non-revenue tasks like manual research and admin work.

  * **Scalability issues:** Scaling pipeline requires a direct increase in SDR headcount, making growth costly and unpredictable.

  * **Qualification challenges:** Without proper signals, SDRs often chase unqualified prospects, reducing efficiency.

**The Core Issue: Misaligned Skillsets**

Learn more about the [role of the GTM engineer in the guide published by
Matteo](https://playbooks.hypergrowthpartners.com/p/the-rise-of-the-gtm-
engineer).

The SDRs perform two fundamentally different jobs requiring distinct
expertise:

  * **Technical/automation tasks** : Managing the latest tools, data enrichment, and workflow optimization.

  * **Human engagement** : Building relationships, understanding buying intent, and strategic outreach.

Instead of relying on traditional SDRs, a hybrid approach improves efficiency:

  * **GTM Engineers** handle automation, optimize prospecting workflows, and integrate AI-driven signals.

  * **SDRs** shift focus to high-value conversations, engaging only when intent is clear.

**Results:**

  * **SDR time** spent on actual prospect conversations.

  * **Scalable growth** without direct headcount expansion.

  * **Higher conversion rates** by engaging based on buying signals.

By modernizing the SDR function, you can reduce headcount while increasing
pipeline efficiency, which directly improves CAC.

Now, let's jump into the 5 components of an Allbound Engine and look at some
practical examples.

Allbound pipeline generation has 5 key components.

  1. **Go-To-Market Strategy & Sales Collateral**: The foundation of your pipeline generation efforts, ensuring your messaging resonates with your ICP.

  2. **Demand Generation** : Creating awareness and interest in your solution through various channels like content, paid ads.

  3. **Intent Signals & AI Automation**: Identifying and acting on prospect signals that indicate buying intent through systematic processes.

  4. **Tools & Playbooks**: Knowing the right tools and how to integrate them properly for the different allbound playbooks.

  5. **Outreach** : The tactical execution of personalized communication based on intent signals.

In this guide, we will mostly focus on **intent signals & AI Automation,** and
the **tools & playbooks** building on that component.

The other components have been covered well by [previous newsletter
episodes](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/) and
[SalesPlaybook](https://de.thesalesplaybook.com/), and we will link to
relevant resources.

The key factor that we’d like to stress again is that having your **Go-To-
Market strategy & sales collateral** in place is imperative to make the most
of your allbound strategy.

It is beyond the scope of this article, but luckily, some previous mrrunlocked
guides can help you with this:

People buy what they know.

Two key stats to help you understand the importance of this component:

  1. 80-90% of buyers have a predefined set of vendors in mind before researching. This is what we call a ‘consideration set’ that buyers create before starting their search.

  2. 90% ultimately chose from this initial list.

Consider your purchasing behavior - you rarely buy from unknown brands without
research, and B2B customers follow the same pattern.

This is why direct outreach alone rarely generates meaningful conversions.
This is where demand generation comes in.

You need to execute marketing tactics that "generate" signals (aka. demand
generation) to make sure you get on the ‘initial list’ of your buyers (be on
the ‘consideration set’).

Here’s a list of key demand generation activities to get on the ‘consideration
set’:

  * **LinkedIn ICP Expansion** : Send 20-30 connection requests daily to your target buyer persona. No selling, just connect, say hello, and build visibility ([LinkedIn auto-connect campaigns](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/148840640/run-auto-connect-campaigns))

  * **LinkedIn Content:** Publish 2-3 high-value posts per week to “warm-up” your network/market. Create a strong [content strategy](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-content-marketing-guide) to make sure you attract the right audience.

  * **Paid Search Ads:** Create [paid ads](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/google-ads-guide) focused on building brand awareness and nurturing future buyers who aren’t yet looking for a solution.

  * **Paid Social (LinkedIn Ads)** : Turn valuable organic content into thought leadership [LinkedIn ads](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/how-to-get-started-with-linkedin)

  * **Webinars** : Run monthly webinars or quarterly summits with relevant topics that extend your company’s network reach. 

  *   * **Value first Outreach** : Cold outreach for demand generation means reaching out to people who haven’t heard of you yet with educational or problem-focused resources, not pushing them to book a call, so they’ll remember you when they’re ready to buy. Use [value-first LK campaigns](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/148840640/run-value-first-linkedin-dm-campaigns), [cold outbound guide](https://thesalesplaybook.com/outbound), and [high-value offer-based campaigns](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ZIQ3U3GPh8iuqxzPrCOryPMHBUf0D9f_m80qDXG4HA/edit?usp=sharing) to learn more about it.

Once you have your demand generation motion in place, you need to know how to
leverage the signals generated through demand generation.

The spectrum of signals is huge.

The comprehensive overview below gives you a better understanding of what's
possible, but you can also get easily lost.

To avoid this, you must find the signals that are most relevant to your GTM
motion, your specific product, and your stage of the company.

Not all signals are equal. They range from meaningless noise to highly
actionable data.

Let’s have a look at some highly relevant signals for early-stage SaaS
operators.

First-party intent data comes from direct interactions with your company's
assets and channels. These signals are the most reliable indicators of
interest.

  1. **Content engagement**

Signals created by people engaging with your LinkedIn content.

  2. **Pricing Page Activity**

Frequent visits to the pricing page often indicate buying interest.

  3. **Booked a Call & Discovery Quiz Completed**

Strong intent signals prospects are actively engaged, exploring solutions, and
ready for a conversation, but are they worth a qualification call?

  4. **New free trial signup**

New signup for your product.

Being early-stage? The founder should consider connecting with a prospect on
LinkedIn + send (personalized) DM/email. We talked about this on the [Founder
LinkedIn Guide](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/155327506/tactic-connecting-on-
linkedin-with-new-signups-and-demo-booker).

Second-party data comes from trusted partners and tools.

LinkedIn, the world's largest professional network with more than 1 billion
members, is the primary source for most of this data, including the signals
we'll discuss below.

However, we need specialized tools to extract data from LinkedIn so we can
automate workflows. While a [LinkedIn Sales
Navigator](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/linkedin-sales-navigator-guide)
license is powerful, it doesn't support many of the automations we'll cover.

Signals:

  1. **Monitor Job Changes**

Understand when a champion changes their company or department.

  2. **Monitor Promotion**

Understand when a champion is promoted.

  3. **New Hires**

Monitor new hires of your ICP.

  4. **Competitor Engagement**

Target LinkedIn profiles that engage with your competitors on LinkedIn.

  5. **Industry Thought Leader Audience**

Target the audience of influential voices in your space.

Market-wide signals that often allow us to infer intent or qualify prospects.

Signals

  1. **Technology Stack (Change)**

Reveal technical environments. Often used for enrichment & segmenting. But you
can also infer intent.

  2. **Review Websites**

Use customer reviews on platforms like G2 or Trustpilot to quickly identify
common complaints, issues, and bugs in a prospect's product. Or use Negative
reviews of your competitors' products as a relevant signal for your outreach.

  3. **News-Based Signals**

**Compliance Updates:** New regulations can drive demand for solutions that
ensure compliance.

**Funding Rounds:** A business receiving new investments often has budget
flexibility and growth initiatives that require external solutions. Tip: The
optimal moment for outreach isn't always immediately after a funding round,
but you can infer when the next round should take place.

**Market Expansion:** Firms entering new markets or geographies often face new
challenges and seek relevant solutions.
