Most early-stage startups use outreach to connect with prospects.

But getting replies and meetings booked is not easy. Only a few see response
rates of 20%+ and 5%+ meeting booked rates.

⛔ The main reason: The emails are seller-centric and do not follow a clear
structure.

✅ Follow the TAPSA framework and learn how to write consistently good emails
that get replies.

TAPSA is an acronym for Trigger, Assume Pain, Solution, Action.

**Good emails always consists of 4 (+ 1 bonus) section:**

**1️⃣ 𝗧𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗴𝗲𝗿**

Section 1 is the opener = setting the context.

It’s the ‘WHY you reach out’. The reason needs to be buyer-centric.

💡 ‘I’m reaching out to you because WE are the market leader in XYZ’ …doesn’t
work.

Because it’s seller-centric and your potential customer doesn’t care about
you.

Make use of trigger events as a reason to reach out.

See the list of trigger events below…

**2️⃣ 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝘂𝗺𝗲 𝗣𝗮𝗶𝗻**

Make the email relevant as you introduce a problem they (might) have - related
to the trigger.

Refer to similar companies/personas that faced similar challenges after such a
trigger event.

If you assume the pain and your prospect faces the same pain, the following
will happen:

Doing so makes your email relevant to them.

**3️⃣ 𝗣𝗶𝘁𝗰𝗵 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻**

Introduce (briefly, at a high-level) your solution to the problem. Add 1/2
benefits and social proof.

Mention how you can help to solve the (assumed) problem for them.

Your [1-sentence value proposition](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexander-
estner_b2bsaas-valueproposition-saasmarketing-
activity-6960488872795373568-mQdY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
is super powerful for this.

The goal is to create interest and curiosity in your service/product, not to
close the deal.

**4️⃣ 𝗖𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻**

Make it easy to move forward.

Do you want them to reply, click a link, book a meeting, or watch a video?

Interest-based soft CTAs work best (more details below).

**𝗕𝗼𝗻𝘂𝘀: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣.𝗦.** Most people read the P.S. - use this extra section to add
value (more details below).

or like this:

  1. Cut the fluff & remove unnecessary words

Avoid phrases that add no value or info like “I hope you’re doing well”

  2. Get right to the point

     * the first opener sentence is key (set the context, use trigger events)

     * be short and clear structure (+ highlight important words)

     * limit the max. length to 4-5 sections, each max. 2 sentences

  3. Use the words your clients are using

Industry-specific jargon is fine - as long as it’s the jargon of them (not
yours)

  4. Make it about them, not you

     * focus on their trigger, on their problem, on their benefit using your solution.

     * Reduce “I” “We” “Our” to the absolute minimum

  5. If you prospect in English as a non-native, use tools like Grammarly or [Lavender.ai](http://lavender.ai/) if you want to get better at copywriting

Be creative with your subject lines.

If people don’t open your email, your actual email content is irrelevant.

by Alan Ruchtein.

Without a clear call-to-action, you will see a low reply rate. Just because
your prospect isn’t clear what’s expected from them as a next step.

Make it easy and clear to move forward.

Basically, there are 3 different types of CTAs for emails:

  1. **Specific CTA:** Asks for a meeting using a  _**specific day and time**_

Example: Are you available to meet on Tuesday at 4pm?

  2. **Open-ended CTA:** Asks for a meeting, but it’s  _**open-ended**_

Example: Do you have time next week to meet?

  3. **Interest-based CTA:** Asks for  _**interest**_ , not a meeting

Example: Are you interested in learning more about X?

[Gong](https://www.gong.io/de/resources/labs/this-surprising-cold-email-cta-
will-help-you-book-a-lot-more-meetings/) found out that for cold outreach
(prospecting), interest-based CTAs show the best result.

The P.S. is the section ‘after’ the actual email. Use this section to share
some extra info.

I believe you can use this section for 3 different usecases:

  1. share additional material (e.g. a case study or a video you’ve created)

  2. share some more ‘personal’ information.

  3. get directions to the right person

Trigger events tell you that a prospect might be interested in your product,
it’s a proxy that they belong to your ICP and that they are ready to buy
(right timing).

Triggers are great for the first sentence of your email (= email opener). It’s
about context setting. A clear reason why you reach out to them. To make the
email relevant for them.

Your job is to find the best-fit triggers that are (with a high likelihood)
connected to a massive problem that you're going to solve for them.

> 📌 **“If** _**TRIGGER EVENT**_**happens, then (most
> probably)**_**PROBLEM**_**happens. “**

Here’s a list of Trigger events that you can use:

  1. Change in team

  2. Headcount changes (growth or decline) over a period of time

  3. Open job postings/ads (on career page or job platforms)

  4. Revenue growth (or decline)

  5. Funding events

  6. M&A activity (Mergers & Acquisitions)

  7. Press, media & news about the company (e.g. Google alerts)

  8. Bad/good reviews:

     * about the company (company review sites like Kununu, Glassdoor)

     * about the product (Capterra, Trustpilot, Google…)

  9. New Product/Feature launched (e.g. on Producthunt, Company Blog, Helpcenter…)

  10. Technographic data

     * software/tools they are using or implemented recently (e.g. identify with tools like builtwith)

     * technology used

     * offered integrations (e.g. Zapier, Salesforce, Notion, etc.)

  11. Listed/launched on marketplaces like Salesforce, Hubspot, Shopify, Zoom etc.

  12. Relevant specific information (e.g. remote-first, bootstrapped) that’s relevant to your solution

  13. Market/industry relevant facts that affect the company/person

     * new laws & regulations

     * competition

     * new reports

     * trends

  1. Personal info about the prospect

     * Experience & Skills

     * Mutual connections

     * New in job/ promotion

  2. Registered for events

     * for your own events

     * for other public events (e.g. LinkedIn events)

     * upcoming conferences/events (e.g. participants, speakers, etc.)

  3. Social media activity

     * posts on their profile or LinkedIn company page

     * people they follow

     * comments made by prospects

     * Linkedin event participants (e.g export via phantombuster)

  4. Activity in (public) communities (e.g. Quora, Reddit, Slack Channels, Facebook Groups etc.)

Depending on the type of trigger events, there are different tools to monitor
and track these events. Check out the following tools:

  * Sales Navigator (for hr-related triggers)

  * Crunchbase (for funding-related triggers)

  * Google alert (press, news)

  * Builtwith (software-related triggers)

**So based on those trigger events, your email opener could look like this:**

  * _“…you also joined (x event)”_

  *  _“…3 new sales reps in your team. Seems like your team is growing…”_

  *  _“…your team is using (tool X) to (usecase)”_

  *  _“…congrats on the launch of your new feature X…”_

  *  _“…a new regulation XYZ will be released on (date)…”_

  *  _“…getting promoted is exciting, but also comes with…”_

Now you know how to use triggers in your cold outreach using the TAPSA
framework.

> **Tip: Focusing on What's Holding You Back**

Running a business, especially in the fast SaaS world, can be a real
rollercoaster. With so much going on, it's easy to get all over the place,
trying to fix everything at once. Here's a tip that I've learned through trial
and error over the years: "Find the bottleneck." That basically means figuring
out the biggest problem that's stopping your business from growing right now.
Out of all the issues, find that one big challenge and put all your effort
into fixing it.

If you've read "The Goal" by Eliyahu M. Goldratt, you'll get where I'm coming
from. Goldratt talks about how focusing on and managing the things that slow
you down can really boost how well your organization works. Even though he
talks about factories, his ideas totally apply to SaaS.

To find this bottleneck, you need to look at yourself, check out data, and get
feedback. Don't just rely on tools and numbers; talk to your team and
customers too. They can show you problems that are obvious and not-so-obvious.

When you find that main bottleneck, put all your energy into fixing it. This
one thing will start a chain reaction, making other parts of your business
better too.

To really succeed in the busy SaaS world, try out this idea of "finding the
bottleneck". And you can get even more smart advice from books like "The
Goal". This way of doing things will help you focus and make a big difference.
