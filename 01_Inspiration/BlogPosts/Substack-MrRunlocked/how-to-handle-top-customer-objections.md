Every SaaS founder and sales professional working in B2B SaaS, will face a lot
of objections and concerns from potential clients. Being prepared for the most
common concerns help you to better handle them and ultimately close more
deals.

That’s why I highly recommend creating your own [Concern Handling
Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YnHpZnao-
xoADNs0tVpXJTkXATBCiU2bei7kRRyrwB8/edit?usp=sharing) .

A concern-handling document can be a very basic document with 3-4 columns:

  1. The objection/concern

  2. How to handle it

  3. Additional resources

  4. (Segmented by buyer journey/ stage in the sales process)

If you target different personas and [ideal customer
profiles](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile), it
makes sense to have versions for each target group.

Here is an easy-to-follow step-by-step guide on how to create your own
version.

**Step 1:** Download my free [Concern Handling
Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YnHpZnao-
xoADNs0tVpXJTkXATBCiU2bei7kRRyrwB8/edit?usp=sharing) (or create your own
version)

[Free Concern Handling
Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YnHpZnao-
xoADNs0tVpXJTkXATBCiU2bei7kRRyrwB8/edit?usp=sharing)

**Step 2:** Gather the **top 5 objections/concerns** for each step of the
sales process:

**Step 3:** Once you know the concern, learn how to best handle them.

When it comes to handling objections, try the following fundamental key
principles:

  * listen actively - really listen. Don’t prepare already for your response.

  * don’t interrupt - let them tell you what they want to tell you.

  * don’t say it’s not true - show understanding of their situation.

  * don’t ignore - acknowledge the fact they have concerns.

  * show understanding, and be open for a conversation - be on the ‘same’ side to discuss openly the real issues.

  * work together with the client, not against them - Focus on helping and guiding them.

  * be interested and uncover the true concerns - ask good questions (Why, How, Who, etc.)

Of course, a good understanding of your product, the competition landscape,
and industry insights help you as well here.

**Step 4:** Add ready-to-use responses and additional resources (for the true
concerns).

The document needs to be a living document (frequently updated) to which all
customer-facing teams (especially salespeople) need access. Once you added
responses for each concern, the document can be a real assistant for you and
your sales team (e.g. open it during cold calling and demos). I would
recommend training your team on objection handling (e.g. during onboarding of
new team members).

Social proof (case studies & testimonials) is a powerful tool to convince
potential customers that your solution is effective and trustworthy. People
like the fact that others (that are similar to them) do/use/trust the same.

Having great case studies and testimonials will increase your conversion
rates. But creating them is not easy. That’s why I will share with you how to
create powerful strong case studies.

**Step 1: Analyze existing clients**

First, you need to prioritize what kind of case study/testimonial you need.
What segment/customer type/use case do you need? Filter your existing clients
based on that.

Then only search for customers which:

**Step 2: Outreach via Email/Phone**

If you’re early-stage getting first testimonials is so important. So be fine
with giving something in return (if needed). This could be a free upgrade,
discount on the first year, free training, etc.

If you are >€ 1 million ARR, instead of giving discounts, sell the benefits of
being one of your testimonials (it’s free marketing exposure for them).

**Step 3: Interview the client (30min+) and prepare questions upfront**

Create a document with 5+ questions and share it with the client upfront.

Questions can include:

  * What challenges did you face before working with X?

  * Why did you decide to search for a solution? Have you tried other solutions before X?

  * How did you find X?

  * What was your experience with X?

  * What changed since you implemented X in your company?

  * What do you want to achieve with X in the future?

  * Would you recommend X to others? If yes, why and to whom?

If possible, ask for permission to record the interview.

**Step 4: Create different types of social proof from the interview**

Ideally, you can create multiple assets from the interview. This could be a
(short and long-form) video testimonial, a written case study, and quotes.

For the (written) Case Study - Follow the [Case Study Template
Structure](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/4-actionable-tips-to-
grow-your-saas-product)

  1. State the PROBLEM of the customer

  2. Solution

  3. The Results (The After)

     1. Include ‘new capabilities’

     2. and also Bottom Line Impact Metrics (e.g. x% cost reduction, y% more revenue)

  4. Personal Quotes, Images, etc.

  5. Call To Action

Product-Market Fit is one of [3 scale-readiness
indicators](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-3-indicators-that-
your-saas-business) and tries to quantify the following:

✅ How satisfied are your customers with the product?

✅ Are they raving about your product?

✅ Do they tell others to use it?

Product-Market fit can be measured by logo [churn rate, product retention
rate, (NPS score](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-3-indicators-
that-your-saas-business)), or with the Sean Ellis Test.

**Here’s how to do it:**

You literally ask your existing users in a quick survey how they would feel if
they could no longer use the product.

> How would you feel if you could no longer use the product?

And you offer them 3 options: “very disappointed” / “somewhat disappointed” /
“not disappointed”

If 40% or more say they would be “very disappointed” if they could no longer
use your product, you achieved product-market fit.

**What you should do if it’s below 40%?**

First of all, it basically means that you have NOT found product-market fit
yet.

This means that you are serving the wrong target audience for your product

—> Revamp your ideal customer profile

or

your product is nice to have but does not really fix an important problem

—> Understand the needs/problems better and find better ways to fix the
problem; Revamp product.

> Create domain expertise in your GTM unit with a radical focus rather than a
> little bit of everything.

It almost sounds like a cool trend to be able to say: "We have customers from
all segments and tens of countries". Unfortunately, that doesn't show that you
can or will scale - rather the opposite.

Instead, focus exclusively on one customer vertical. Win in it, dominate it,
and then expand into the next logical, obvious one.

Ask your team, both in Marketing, Sales, and Customer Success - if you could
decide to work with one customer, every day. Which one would it be?

Based on these insights (+ data-based insights) generate twin companies (that
are very similar to them) and approach them via an "account-based selling"
approach.
