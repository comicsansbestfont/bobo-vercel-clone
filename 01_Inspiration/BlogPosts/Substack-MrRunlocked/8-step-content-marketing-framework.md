[Content Marketing](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-content-
marketing-guide) is one of [16 powerful growth
channels](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/12-powerful-b2b-saas-
channels-for).

If you are an early-stage B2B SaaS startup, content marketing & outbound sales
should be your main growth channels (followed by referral programs and paid
search).

**With content marketing you will:**

✔️ Build trust (—> being seen as an industry expert)

✔️ Drive inbound leads sustainably (vs. paid traffic that goes to 0 if you
stop spending money on ads)

✔️ Increase conversion rates along the customer journey

Invest in content marketing and do it as early as possible❗

You will see how your SaaS will grow 3x faster 🚀

Content marketing is easier than you think.

Here is a **simple 8-step guide**. 👇

1️⃣ Identify the main problems of your [ideal customer
profile](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile)

2️⃣ Learn what they are interested in and what’s valuable for them

3️⃣ Identify 1-2 channels (e.g. Linkedin and Youtube) where they hang out

4️⃣ Create 1-2 highly valuable assets (e.g. e-book, course, templates) and a
nurturing campaign

5️⃣ Have weekly/bi-weekly content themes and create content around this topic

6️⃣ Distribute the ‘same’ content on different channels (e.g., a youtube
video, 3 LinkedIn posts, 1 newsletter, etc.)

7️⃣ Repurpose your content every 3 month

8️⃣ Rewrite the same message in many different ways (no need to write
something new every day)

Bonus tip: Create content for each stage in the funnel, not only for the Top
of the funnel.

👉 To learn more about how to say 1 thing in 1000 ways and frequently repurpose
your content, check out [Justin Welsh’s Content
playbook](https://www.justinwelsh.me/blog/6112022).

P.S. More and more founders build a [personal
brand](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/founder-led-linkedin-guide), create a
large following and establish themself as industry experts. They use their
personal accounts and publish relevant content for their [ideal customer
profile](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-powerful-
ideal-customer). Especially for Linkedin and Twitter, content marketing works
better with personal accounts than with company accounts.

You are a founder or sales leader and feel uncomfortable doing the classic
sales calls?

You are not alone!

Prospects also don’t like seller-centric pitches.

It doesn’t have to be like that. Sales calls can get really smooth.

A great way to sell without actually 'selling' is called storytelling!

And it's so powerful 💪.

**5-steps to sell with a story** 👇

1️⃣ X had a problem (Introduce problem)

2️⃣ X couldn’t fix it (Highlight pain points)

3️⃣ X tried many things (Discard alternative solutions)

4️⃣ Then X tried your product (Present your solution)

5️⃣ Now X is happy (Sell them the outcome)

You are ‘selling’ without actually selling.

You are telling a transformation story.

You can use storytelling in all your customer-facing communication:

✔️ Blog posts and newsletter

✔️ Customer success stories / Case studies

✔️ Sales calls and demos

✔️ Welcome email sequences

✔️ Email Nurturing

✔️ Webinars, Podcasts...

Tomasz Tunguz [says](https://tomtunguz.com/three-value-propositions/) there
are 3 reasons **why companies buy your product**.

1️⃣ Increased revenue

2️⃣ Reduced costs

3️⃣ Improved productivity

So people don’t buy services.

They buy results. They buy outcomes. They buy transformation.

You need to solve their pain! Then they buy!

Of course, for the single user and buyer persona this could mean:

4️⃣ You make them feel good

5️⃣ You make their life easier

Here are **3 examples of how to sell outcomes** (and not features).

1️⃣ If your product is an email marketing software, you sell an engaging
growing audience.

2️⃣ If your product is a booking software for restaurants, you sell more
revenue and higher utilization.

3️⃣ If your product is a sales CRM, you sell a full pipeline and higher
conversions (ultimately more revenue).

You basically shift the attention from inputs (e.g. your features) to outcomes
and results.

Your getting lots of leads but seeing a low conversion to demo (for sales-led)
or a low conversion to active leads (for product-led)?

It’s time for you to analyze and get answers!

Early-stage SaaS startups should ask every non-converting signup for feedback.

You will collect lots of valuable feedback.

That lets you optimize your product, your messaging, your pricing, etc.

Here is an **easy 4-step approach:** 👇

1️⃣ Get a list of all non-converting leads & trigger an email sequence (e.g.
founder is reaching out to learn what’s missing for them to convert) - don’t
do this once, rather set up an automation (e.g. X days after the signup date).

2️⃣ Create a super simple survey with non-converting reasons (multi-select or
dropdown) + open text field for more information (+ synch the feedback in your
CRM)

3️⃣ Even consider to outreach via phone (if you are sales-led) to qualified
leads

4️⃣ Based on the reason you can proactively offer a solution for that, e.g.:

✔️ Product was too complex —> offer a free training session

✔️ Too expensive —> restate your value proposition and offer a discount

✔️ Trial was too short —> Extend the free trial for 14 days

Bonus tip: Do the same for churns.

Have a churn customer email automation (asking for churn reason) + reach out
to them via phone.

Tip: Even if you think you have a good gut feeling, you should start tracking
your financials & KPIs properly from the beginning. At the latest when you
talk to potential investors/buyers, you'll appreciate how much stronger your
position is if you have the numbers at hand.

Failure: Before I joined [saas.group](https://saas.group/), I always thought
that you need a groundbreaking idea / top resume / relevant experience / VC
funding to build a successful (SaaS) startup.

Learning: Conversations with hundreds of founders have shown me that, in the
end, you don't need all that. If you have something you'd like to pursue, just
do it and learn along the way (Google is your best friend). Also, you can
define what "successful" means to you - not everyone needs to build a unicorn.

P.S. Definitely check out [saas.group](https://saas.group/) if you consider
selling your (Micro) SaaS business. Dirk is happy to jump on a call with you.

I can highly recommend [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to draft your content
(e.g. newsletter, Linkedin posts).

It’s super simple to get started, great to collaborate with team members, and
also suitable to become your internal content library.

Happy growth 🚀.
