Today's blog will share an overview of 16 organic B2B growth channels that can
generate traction for your startup.

Paid marketing channels (e.g. Google Ads, Facebook Ads..) rely on spending
money to reach and engage with your potential customer. Organic marketing
channels focus on generating traffic to your site over time without any
marketing spending.

Paid marketing is great for driving immediate growth for your startup. Paid
ads can give you a quick and powerful boost in traffic volume and conversions
(e.g. sign-ups).

But it has also some problems and disadvantages:

  1. costs for ads (CPC) are getting more expensive (because of higher competition & saturation)

  2. your growth relies on always adding more marketing spend (once you stop paying for ads your growth will stop (no new sign-ups or demos).

  3. if your growth only relies on paid advertising it’s rather easy to copy

Organic (non-paid) marketing channels normally take longer to show first
results, but the advantage is that you do not rely on constantly increasing
your marketing spending and can build a growth engine that is hard to copy (&
compete against).

For every (early-stage) startup it’s important to start testing and
experimenting with new traction channels and hopefully find new sources of
customers. You have to spend your energy and resources only on the marketing
channels that impact traction for your business (and stop the ones that don‘t)
and those will vary for every startup.

But how do you find the right marketing channels and balance your resources
and budget?

The answer is testing new strategies and channels fast and only with a small
amount of money or time allocated. The goal is to quickly find out if those
channels could return good results for your business. Based on that test
either invest more in those channels or move on. Make sure you are tracking
the results of each of those tests.

Take the time to think about creative ways how you could test the following 16
organic B2B growth marketing channels for your business.

Inbound marketing means that potential customers get in touch with you (and
not that you’re outreaching to them). They discover your product or content
(that is valuable for them) and want to get in touch with you. Depending on
your growth strategy ([product-led vs. sales-led vs. hybrid
growth](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-
saas-growth?s=w)), they either sign up for your free trial or book a demo with
your sales team.

If you’re building a B2B SaaS product you should definitely consider posting
content on LinkedIn. Sharing relevant information for your target audience on
LinkedIn helps you to:

  * build authority and trust

  * be seen as an industry expert

  * increase brand awareness

  * engage with your ideal customers

  * drive demand for your product

It’s important that you share content that is relevant to your [ideal customer
profile](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-powerful-
ideal-customer?s=w) (ICP). Don’t just post about how great your product is and
what amazing features you offer, rather talk about problems, challenges, and
opportunities of your ICP and share interesting facts, strategies, or news for
them. So think about the following content types for Linkedin:

Similar to LinkedIn, Twitter can work really well to drive demand for your
product. Don't spam your followers, be selective on the content you share, and
always aim for high-value content. If your published content is valuable to
your potential customers, they are more willing to click your CTA, get in
touch with you and try your product and even share your content with others.

As a CEO and founder of your startup, you should consider building your own
audience on Linkedin and Twitter (in parallel to the company’s account) and
leveraging it to drive growth for your business.

Facebook is probably not the first channel you should consider when you run a
B2B SaaS venture, but there are pretty interesting and niche groups on
Facebook. Especially if you target the prosumer and SMB market, it’s worth
checking out.

The beautiful part about those groups is that it’s easier for you to target
your ideal customer profile.

There are 2 ways to leverage Facebook groups, either start your own Facebook
group (if there aren’t high-quality groups) and join existing ones. Here are
some examples of how to use Facebook groups:

  * You’re building CRM Software for Youtube Creators? —> Join/Create a Facebook group for youtube creators and share relevant content with them (e.g. How to create high-quality thumbnails)

  * You’re helping software companies to hire remote talents? —> Join/Create a Facebook group for HR managers in software companies

Starting your own podcast takes a bit more effort. But if you know how to do
it, it really helps you to build a high level of authority (and differentiate
yourself from potential competitors). A great way for startups to launch a
podcast is by inviting customers and industry experts as podcast guests. In
the podcast, don't be too sales-driven and only talk about your product.
Instead, talk about big topics, challenges, or problems of your customers. The
content needs to be highly valuable for them.

Tip: Ask your podcast guests to share the podcast also with their audience
(cross-promotion).

Also, start to outreach to other Podcast hosts that your ICP is listening to.
Ask them to invite you for a guest podcast episode.

Youtube is the second largest search engine in the world (after Google).
Youtube is mostly used for search queries around things you don't know (e.g.
How to build a website, How to get more inbounds...). That's a great
opportunity for you to start a channel and create content that educates/helps
your ideal customers with their problems/challenges/questions.

Medium is a great platform to publish your content and grow your audience. It
has over 60 million active users. It’s an open platform where readers find
articles and can follow authors. Similar to the other platforms, focus on your
target audience (your niche) and share relevant content with them. (Follow me
on [Medium](https://medium.com/@StartupBusinesstips))

Starting your own newsletter and #8 (your own blog) often comes hand in hand.
Whenever you publish a new article on your blog, send out a newsletter to your
subscribers to check out the new piece.

Of course, you can also run different newsletters at the same time (e.g.
Weekly tips vs. Monthly In-depth analysis)

Compared to the other inbound marketing channels SEO takes way longer to show
results (mostly 12 to 18 months). But in the long run, SEO can be really
beneficial for your marketing growth (e.g. ranking on search page one on
Google for relevant keywords).

Think about platforms and existing communities where your ideal target
customer already hangs out. Especially if you target prosumer and SMB
businesses, building a community (or sharing relevant content) on Product
Hunt, Reddit or Indiehackers can work quite well.

Start early with building a community and sharing relevant content. I see more
and more startups building a community first, and then building the product
for this specific community.

For all content-related marketing channels, I would suggest you repurpose your
content (Check out Hubspot's article on [Repurposing
Content](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/examples-repurposing-content)).
This means that you are covering a specific topic (e.g. every week or
biweekly) and producing different kinds of content formats for it. For
instance, you can write a blog post on your website (for SEO reasons) and
repurpose the content for other inbound marketing channels like LinkedIn and
Twitter. On top of that, you could create a new Youtube Video and Podcast
talking about the information you’ve covered in the blog post. Vice versa can
also work, e.g. repurpose your Youtube and podcast content for your blog
articles.

A referral program is a super powerful growth channel. Not asking your
existing customers for referrals is [one of the most common mistakes in B2B
SaaS Growth](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/8-common-go-to-market-
mistakes-3x?s=w). This is especially bad because growing with referrals is
cheaper and more effective than acquiring completely new customers. When your
existing customers refer others to you (for free or for a small referral
bonus) they mostly refer peers to you, which means they fit your [ideal
customer profile](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-
powerful-ideal-customer?s=w). Referred leads normally have a higher trust in
your business, belong to your ICP, and therefore also show higher conversion
rates.

So make sure you frequently ask your customers for referrals and even
incentivize them to do so.

What’s important about a referral marketing program:

  * customer segmentation: Track your customers’ NPS score and product usage and only target your happy customers

  * timing & frequency: ask your customers for referrals at the right time (not straight after the signup, give them some time to experience your product and become a happy customers). Think about triggers in your customer journey where customers are happy with your product and willing to refer your product.

  * referral incentive: What is the referral bonus (cash vs. free product usage vs. other perks) and who gets the bonus when? Make sure it’s transparent and use a two-sided referral program and incentivize both parties (the referrer and referred) - [check out some referral program examples](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/referral-program-incentives/) or [Cello’s referral examples](https://cello.so/b2b-referral-program-examples/). 

  * communication & messaging: Figure out the right messaging and best channels (in-product, email, phone...) to ask for referrals; create rules on when (triggers) and how often you ask for referrals

  * technical implementation & tools: referral tracking and referral bonus payout

Compared to Inbound marketing, Outbound marketing means that you’re
outreaching your potential customer. It can be highly efficient for B2B
companies. The higher your ACL (average contract value) the more important it
is. Especially if you’re following a [traditional sales-led growth
strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-
saas-growth?s=w), outbound channels are key for your growth.

Yes, cold emails still work. Make sure that you personalize your email and
don't spam your prospects. There are [great
tools](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/best-tools-for-start-ups-
and-digital) that help you to write personalized cold emails and even automate
the process later on (Email marketing automation). If you don't have the email
addresses of your potential customers, think about purchasing emails, hire a
freelancer on [Fiverr](https://go.fiverr.com/visit/?bta=281592&brand=fb) or
[Upwork](https://upwork.pxf.io/P0VR4j) to scrap leads for you, or use lead
scraper tools like [Phantombuster.](https://phantombuster.com/)

If you are selling products with a high ACV (average contract value), sending
personalized letters can work. The advantages of physical _old school_ letters
are:

  * most companies don't use them (so you are special)

  * they have an almost 100% open rate

  * you can be creative and design nice envelopes

Similar to cold email, cold calling still works. Especially if it's hard for
you to target your ideal customer online, phone calls can be a very powerful
strategy.

As for most strategies, make sure you have a great sales pitch in place. This
means, engaging with your customer, asking questions, talking about pain
points, and presenting values (and not features). It makes sense to do some
training for cold calling.

With Walk-ins I mean to visit a potential client in their office or store.
This is not a strategy for everyone, but it can work quite well for specific
industries and target audiences. If you know who your target customer is (e.g.
hairdresser, restaurant, or gyms) it is easy for you to find their address and
just do a walk-in without an appointment. I saw this strategy works really
well in the POS Software market for restaurants, online booking software for
hairdressers, or business management software for sports venues.

Another great way to grow your startup is to leverage existing large
marketplaces, where your ideal customers already are. Think about other
marketplaces for your specific industry.

**Marketplaces**

If you're building a SaaS product, the chances are high that integrations and
APIs to other market-dominant players can help you with your own growth. Even
if your core product would not require integrations to Salesforce, Hubspot,
Shopify, or Zoom, or an extension for Google Chrome, it still could make sense
to build it (or create a simple chrome extension), leverage the power of their
marketplaces to generate sign ups, and later upsell your core product.

Have a look at other new and upcoming marketplaces in your industry? Who are
the dominant players in your space and do they offer any kind of integrations
of marketplaces? How can you leverage them for your own growth?

More and more software companies launching their own marketplaces and APIs -
e.g. [Personio’s marketplace](https://marketplace.personio.de/), [Miro’s
marketplace](https://miro.com/marketplace/), or [Mailchimp’s
marketplace](https://mailchimp.com/marketplace/apps/)

**Software Review Sites**

Being present on popular Software review sites like G2 Crowd, Capterra, Getapp
helps you to increase traffic. Potential customers use software review sites
to find the best-rated tools for their specific use case. Make sure to get
reviews as this is key to being successful on those review sites.

Find a potential partner who is targeting the same ideal customer (just with
another product). You can do co-promotions and help each other to grow. E.g.
if you're selling email marketing software for digital freelancers, partner up
with a company that sells accounting software for digital freelancers or a job
platform for freelancers. You can co-promote each other in newsletters, run a
co-hosted webinar, or be guest speakers in each other's podcasts.

If you are selling software, make sure that you still control most of the
customer journey and only outsource the distribution part to the reseller.

I saw this strategy works quite well for employee benefits software (resellers
are accounting companies who already work with lots of companies, that are the
ICP of the employee benefits software) and also for sports booking software
(resellers are sports brands who already worked together with sports venues).
