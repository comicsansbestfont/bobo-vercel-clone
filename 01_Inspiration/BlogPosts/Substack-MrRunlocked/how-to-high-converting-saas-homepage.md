  * Your product is more complex than quantum physics

  * You've tried every "conversion optimization" trick in the book and failed

  * Your current homepage looks like it was designed by a committee of drunk monkeys

  * You think your product is "too complicated" to explain simply

Your homepage is the number one customer-facing messaging asset.

It's often the first point of contact between your potential customers and
your product. A well-crafted homepage can be the difference between a visitor
bouncing and a visitor starting their buyer journey (e.g., signing up for a
free trial or booking a demo).

Your homepage should primarily speak to your potential customers ([your Ideal
Customer Profile or ICP](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-
customer-profile)) - not to your employees, investors, media, or other
stakeholders. Its primary goal is to convert visitors to the next stage of
your sales journey.

**A good homepage should answer these 6 key questions for your visitors:**

  1. What is the product/service they offer?

  2. What problem does it solve for me?

  3. What can I do with the product?

  4. Who is it for? Is this product for me?

  5. What are the main benefits for me?

  6. Can I trust the company?

Now, let's dive into the 8-step process to help you create a homepage that
answers these questions and converts visitors into leads and customers.

Before you build your new SaaS homepage, invest time to have strong
fundamentals (aka. product marketing). Use our templates for that:

👉 [The Ultimate Framework to build your Ideal Customer Profile for SaaS
startups](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile)

👉 [The Ultimate SaaS Messaging Framework for early-stage
Startups](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-framework)

This step involves setting the market and minimum viable positioning and
identifying the high-level problem your product solves.

**Example (sipgate trunking):**

  * **Market insight** : The rise of remote work and multi-location teams is increasing the need for flexible, scalable communication solutions

  * **High-level problem** : Existing phone systems are often rigid, costly, and difficult to manage across multiple locations

This step is crucial for understanding who's most affected by the problem
you're solving.

**Example (sipgate trunking):**

  * **Primary ICP** : IT Admins & Teams in fast-growing SMBs, especially those with high volumes of outgoing calls

  * They're trying to optimize their telephone costs and find a scalable and flexible solution

Understand what customers are currently doing to solve their problems (status
quo).

  * List different alternatives

  * Build clusters of alternatives

  * Add limitations for each cluster

**Example (sipgate trunking):**

  * Current Solution: Using separate phone systems at different locations

  * Limitations: Fragmented communication, high administrative effort

This is where you finally talk about your solution.

  * Define your product category

  * Identify key capabilities (what customers can do with your product that they can't without it)

  * List the top features that enable these capabilities

**Example (sipgate trunking):**

  * Product Category: SIP Trunking Solution

  * Key Capability: Scale your phone system easily on demand

  * Top Feature: Seamless integration into existing VoIP systems

Connect all elements to create compelling value propositions.

  * Identify the results (what your product is increasing or decreasing)

  * Distinguish between functional, social, and emotional benefits

  * Add social proof and objection-handling elements

Each value proposition consists of:

  1. **Use Case:** Identify the primary job your customer is trying to do.

  2. **Current Way:** How are they currently solving this problem?

  3. **Problem:** What's wrong with the current solution?

  4. **Capability:** What can your product do to solve this?

  5. **Feature:** What specific feature enables this capability?

  6. **Benefit:** What's the result for the customer?

Example: Let's say you're Calendly (scheduling software):

  * **Use Case:** Scheduling meetings with clients

  * **Current Way:** Back-and-forth emails to find a suitable time

  * **Problem:** Time-consuming, inefficient, prone to double-booking

  * **Capability:** Automate scheduling process

  * **Feature:** Shareable booking link with real-time availability

  * **Benefit:** Save time and eliminate scheduling headaches

Now we'll structure our homepage according to "**The B2B SaaS Performance
Design Homepage Framework** " template, using your messaging to create
compelling copy for each section.

The perfect SaaS Homepage comes with 10 sections:

**1\. The (Sticky) Navigation Bar Section**

  * Include your logo, main navigation items (section links for a landing page), and Main CTA

  * Consider making it sticky to have the Main CTA always visible in the viewport

**Example (Perspective):**

**2\. The Hero Section (Above the Fold)**

This is the most important section of your website. It should grab attention
and answer core questions about your product.

Elements to include:

  * Headline (H1)

  * Subheadline or description

  * Primary and secondary CTAs

  * Product image/animation/video

  * Objection-handlers and Trust Elements

**Example (Spherecast):**

**Example (sipgate trunking):**

Build trust immediately after the hero section.

  * Showcase customer logos, ideally of known companies

  * Add a tagline highlighting your ICP company type (optional)

  * Consider using testimonials, case studies, or third-party reviews

**Example (fyno):**

**Example (clay):**

Connect with visitors by acknowledging their pain points.

  * Use elements from your [Messaging Framework](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-saas-messaging-framework): Problem, Primary current solution (Status Quo), Competitive alternatives & limitations

  * I recommend using this section when your customer is not that aware yet, so some companies we work with tend to keep this optional or use this section in a modified way, e.g. with a comparison table (Old world (Status Quo) vs. New world (with your solution))

**Example (ZenAdmin):**

**Example (Spherecast):**

**Example (Encharge):**

Bridge the gap between the problem and your detailed solution.

Present your core value propositions, showing how you solve the customer's
problems.

**Example (Spherecast):**

**Example (sipgate trunking):**

**This value proposition section addresses the key elements:**

  1. It leads with the capability

  2. It emphasizes the problem

  3. It highlights the key feature

  4. It clearly states the main benefit

  5. It explains what you can do with it

  6. It shows the transformation from the current way to the new solution

Address specific needs or objections of your visitors. Options include:

**Feature Wall Example (LeadTable):**

**Feature Wall Example (Dealforward):**

**Integrations Section Example (Close CRM and Clay):**

**Pricing Section Example (sipgate trunking):**

**Security Section Example (Calendly):**

Reinforce trust near the bottom of your page.

**Example (Senja):**

**Example (sipgate trunking):**

**Example (Coana.tech)**

Handle potential questions related to objections.

**Example (clay):**

Make your final pitch and guide visitors to take action.

**Example (sipgate trunking):**

**Example (Livestorm)**

No rocket science here. You can include an alternative CTA depending on your
target audience and provide some legal information.

**Example (sipgate trunking):**

Bring your strategy to life with a design that enhances your message, and
doesn't distract from it.

**Key design principles include:**

  1. Use whitespace effectively to guide the eye

  2. Ensure your design is mobile-responsive

  3. Use contrasting colors for your CTA buttons

  4. Incorporate high-quality, relevant images or animations

  5. Maintain consistency with your brand guidelines

Continuously gather data, test variations, and refine your approach based on
user behavior. Here's how:

  1. Set up heat mapping and scroll depth tracking

  2. Implement A/B testing for key elements (headlines, CTAs, images)

  3. Monitor your core metrics (bounce rate, time on page, conversion rate)

  4. Gather qualitative feedback through user testing and surveys

  5. Iterate based on your findings, focusing on the elements that move the needle most
* * *

  1. Include a CTA/button in almost every section

  2. Use powerful, concise CTAs (max 3 words) like "Get started", "Free trial", "Book a demo"

  3. Focus on headlines - 80% of visitors only read these

  4. Use a conversational tone and your ICP's language

  5. Address the visitor directly (speak to one person)

  6. Keep copy short and easy to understand

The reason is simple: Your homepage isn't about you. It's about **THEM**.

**Your ideal customer. Their problems. Their desires. Their language.**

Most B2B SaaS companies get this dead wrong. They start with features, with
their "revolutionary technology," with what THEY think is important.

Focusing on the customer first creates a message that resonates deeply, making
your solution feel like the obvious choice. Combining this with a crystal-
clear design will skyrocket your conversions.

  1. Most B2B SaaS companies start with their product features. Big mistake. Your customers don't care about your features. They care about their problems.

  2. Generic "best practices" are BS. What works for one company might tank conversions for another. You need a tailored approach based on your unique customers and value proposition.

  3. Clarity trumps cleverness every damn time. Your homepage isn't the place to show off your witty wordplay. It's the place to communicate your value so clearly that a drunk monkey could understand it.

  4. Design without strategy is just pretty garbage. Sure, your site might win some design awards, but if it's not converting, who cares?

  5. Most companies give up too soon. They try one or two things, don't see immediate results, and throw in the towel. This is a process. It takes time, testing, and refinement.

The good news? You don't have to do this alone.
