Imagine this: you’ve built an incredible SaaS product. You know it works. Your
first (beta) users love it.

But when you launch...

❌ No sales.

❌ No sign-ups.

Because people don’t trust what they don’t see working.

That’s where case studies and testimonials become your secret weapon. Before
someone buys, they need proof that your product works (aka. social proof).

And there’s no better proof than real customers saying,

**“This SaaS changed my business.” - Customer X**

That’s why case studies are one of your most crucial GTM assets.

You can (and should) use case studies:

✅ on your [website](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/how-to-high-converting-saas-
homepage)

✅ in your [sales deck](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/high-converting-sales-
deck)

✅ on your blog articles & landing pages

✅ on social (e.g. LinkedIn posts)

✅ in your sales prospecting

✅ for fundraising

But when we work with SaaS founders, we usually hear the same **3 challenges**
:

**1️⃣ How do we get that proof when you’re just starting?**

**2️⃣ What type of case studies & testimonials work the best?**

**3️⃣ How do we write a good case study? What is a good case study
structure?**

So we decided to join forces and write a guide to answer these questions.

**By the end of this guide, you’ll know:**

✅ Where and how to get your first testimonials - even if you don’t have
customers yet.

✅ How to find testimonials everywhere - sometimes they’re already out there,
you just need to collect them.

✅ Case study trends you should know - from traditional written case studies to
Walls of Love, video testimonials, and quote libraries.

✅ How to structure and distribute case studies for maximum impact, ensuring
they reach the right audience.

✅ Case Study Interview Questions

✅ SaaS Case Study Page template you can steal :)

So let’s dive into it.

When you don’t have a big customer base yet, getting testimonials can feel
impossible. But here’s the good news: you don’t need hundreds of customers to
start building credibility.

Here’s how to get testimonials early:

  * **Pilot Customers & Beta Testers** – offer free or discounted access in exchange for honest feedback.

  * **Happy (Early) Customers** – [identify power users](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/157540641/how-to-find-your-icp-a-step-by-step-process) who are already engaging with your product and ask for their experiences.

  * **Customer Support Conversations** – ever had a user say, “This is amazing”? That’s a testimonial waiting to be captured.

  * **Review Platforms & Social Proof** – if someone mentions your product on LinkedIn or Twitter, screenshot it and use it (with permission).

But remember, your approach to collecting testimonials depends on the type of
clients you serve.

The approach that works for PLG SaaS, where users try the product before
committing, will be different from that of an SLG SaaS.

Let’s explore which strategy is better suited for each.

For [PLG SaaS](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-saas-
growth), testimonials should be casual, fast, and frictionless. Users may not
want to craft something formal, nor would they want to spend a lot of time on
it. So make it super easy for them.
* * *

**Email Template**

 _Hi [Client’s Name],  
I noticed you’ve been getting great results with [Product]!_

_Would you be open to sharing a quick testimonial? If it helps, here’s a
simple framework:_

_✅ What problem were you facing before?  
✅ How did our product help?  
✅ What impact have you seen?_

_You can just reply here, and I’ll tweak it into a short quote if needed!_

_Best,  
[Your Name]_
* * *

This format works because it is casual, quick, and low-effort - ideal for
self-serve users.

📌 **Bonus Tip:** If users are busy (or lazy), write the testimonial for them
based on their feedback and ask for approval. Works like a charm 😉

For [SLG SaaS](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-saas-
growth), you will mostly deal with fewer clients and higher ACVs. Sales cycles
are longer, and usually, multiple stakeholders are involved.

So you can try to get 2-3 case studies early on. We recommend that you build a
small portfolio of case studies that you can then strategically use for sales:

_✅ a case study for each use case (in case your product covers more)_

_✅ a case study for different industries/customer types_

 _✅ a case study for different benefits  
(example: One on x% time saving; the other one on y% increase in revenue)_

We suggest you hand-select the [best-fit
customers](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/analyze-your-icp) and proactively
reach out to them.

Calling them might be the best channel.

But if you prefer email, use the template below:
* * *

**Email Template**

 _Hi [Client’s Name],_

_Hope you're doing well! We’re thrilled to see [Company Name] making the most
of [Product Name]._

_Over the last [timeframe] you used [product feature/capability 1] over [usage
number of product feature/capability 1] and [product feature/capability 2]
over [usage number of product feature/capability 2] - resulting in
[benefit/results 1] and [benefit/results 2]._

_We’d love to highlight your success and share your story with others in
[industry]._

_Would you be open to a quick 15-minute chat where we capture your experience?
We can also draft a short testimonial based on your feedback for you to
approve._

_Let me know what works best for you!_

_Best,  
[Your Name]_
* * *

This format works because it is more structured and aligns with enterprise
buyers who prefer process-driven interactions.

**Takeaway:** Tailor your testimonial request strategy based on your SaaS
model to increase your chances of getting powerful social proof!

Most SaaS founders think testimonials have to be formal quotes collected via
surveys or emails. But in reality, testimonials are happening all around you.

Here’s where to look 👇

People talk about products they love, even when you’re not asking them to.
Scan for mentions:

  * Social media (LinkedIn, X, Reddit, YouTube)

  * Community discussions (Slack, Discord, Product Hunt)

  * Emails, LinkedIn DM & Slack messages from happy users

That’s all social proof. Capture it!

You can turn these into:

**👇 Example** : YouTube comment comparing Notion vs. SmartSuite

**👇 Example** : LinkedIn discussion about ClickUp vs. SmartSuite

**☝️ Yes, these are testimonials in the wild. Capture them!**

**👇 Example** : Email & LinkedIn DMs

**👇 Example** : WhatsApp Feedback message

Yes, even a WhatsApp message from a customer watching a webinar = authentic
feedback.

If you’re listed on G2, Capterra, Trustpilot, Provenexpert**,** or AppSumo,
start collecting positive reviews and featuring them on your site.
