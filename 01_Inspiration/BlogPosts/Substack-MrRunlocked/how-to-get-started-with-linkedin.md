The guide to getting started with LinkedIn Ads for early-stage SaaS startups
covers:

  1. 10-point checklist if LinkedIn ads are the right channel for you

  2. How long does it take to see results?

  3. Step-by-step guide to creating your LinkedIn campaigns

  4. 3 mistakes to avoid with your campaigns

In the early days of a SaaS startup, it is all about getting traction while
working with a lean budget. And if you are a B2B startup, it won’t be long
until “LinkedIn ads” will occupy one of the
[channel](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/12-powerful-b2b-saas-channels-for)
slots in your [GTM strategy](https://alexestner.gumroad.com/l/saas-growth-
worksheet). And that is for good reason:

  * B2B SaaS companies spent more than 45% of their paid media budget on LinkedIn Ads ([Hockeystack](https://hockeystack.com/lab-blog-posts/linkedin-ads-benchmarks-2023))

  * To perform successful lead generation, almost 96% of business marketers rely on LinkedIn ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/business/marketing/blog/linkedin-ads/why-you-should-be-marketing-on-linkedin-right-now))

  * LinkedIn ads have the best targeting when it comes to reaching decision-makers in organizations with over 65 million decision-makers on their platform ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/important-linkedin-statistics-data-trends-oleksii-bondar-pqlie/))

  * 75% of paid social media marketers choose LinkedIn to launch paid campaigns ([Content Marketing Institut](https://de.slideshare.net/slideshow/12th-annual-b2b-content-marketing-benchmarks-budgets-and-trends-insights-for-2022/250420634#1))

But running ads on LinkedIn is quite different than running ads on Google or
Facebook. The main differences are:

  * LinkedIn ads do not have a sophisticated algorithm that handles the targeting for you

  * You will have a harder time proof ROI

  * Campaign setups tend to be more complex

  *   * LinkedIn ads are not a demand capture (transactional) channel, it is an awareness generation channel (similar to SEO)

This guide aims to help you understand if LinkedIn ads are the right channel
for you and if it is, what the optimal setup looks like to get started - even
on a lean and mean budget.

Whether you're starting your first campaigns or you already have campaigns
running and want to get more performance out of your budget, this guide will
provide the answers you need:

  * Do LinkedIn ads make sense for my business?

  * How long does it take to see results with LinkedIn ads?

  * What mistakes should I avoid?

  * Which campaigns should I launch?

  * What type of creatives work best?

  * What are KPIs to look for?

Let’s move on and see whether LinkedIn ads are the right channel for you.

To find out if LinkedIn ads make sense for you, you first need to check the
following boxes.

**Minimum:**

  1. You have product-market fit (using LinkedIn ads as a research channel is very expensive if you have not nailed your target audience, core offer, price point, or value proposition yet)

  2. Your target audience is active on LinkedIn (active is important since just because you can target them, does not mean they actively use the network - and thus see your ads)

  3. ACV > $8.000 (LinkedIn ads can be quite expensive and sales cycles quite long, so it is important that your pricing can support this investment)

  4. A decent website or landing page that already converts

  5. Minimum monthly budget of $3.000 over 3 months (CPCs are high and exposing your audience to different messages and impacting the buyer journey takes time)

  6. You have other marketing channels that are performing (SEA, SEO, Email, Affiliates, Organic Social) and you use LinkedIn ads as part of your overall marketing strategy - not as the sole driver

  7. Your LinkedIn company page is well set up (posts, information, 1.000+ followers)

  8. You have a CRM

Once you have established that you fit the minimum requirements, you can check
if you fulfill the bonus points which improves the chance of success for your
campaigns.

**Bonus points:**

  9. One or more people at your company are already actively posting on LinkedIn

  10. You have a highly visual product

Now that you know what to consider before setting up your campaigns you are
probably wondering how long it takes until you can see the effort pay off.

You should be seeing conversions within the first 30 days of launching. If you
don’t it is most likely that:

  * your offer is either not relevant enough,

  * your budget is not big enough to reach your audience often enough, or

  * you reach the wrong audience.

To be able to tell if LinkedIn ads are the right fit for you it takes at least
3-6 months until you should start seeing substantial conversions and pipeline.

But as always “it depends” because a lot of the “time to result” depends on

Just take a look at a recent study done by HockeyStack. They found out that it
took a total of 222 touchpoints and 2.627 LinkedIn impressions for a person to
go from first impression to a closed won deal
([Hockeystack](https://hockeystack.com/lab-blog-posts/what-does-it-take-to-
close-a-deal)) across an average sales cycle of 69 days
([Hockeystack](https://hockeystack.com/lab-blog-posts/recap-2023)).
Considering this it becomes evident as to why it takes time until LinkedIn ads
results show.

Advertisers new to LinkedIn can easily be overwhelmed by the different
campaign types on LinkedIn.

There are 10 different ad formats for 7 campaign objectives (excluding
recruiting-related objectives).

Not every ad format is compatible with every campaign type. Because of this,
we created this overview so you know which campaign types you need to use to
use a certain ad format.

  * Description: Single image ads include an image that directly appears in the LinkedIn feed

  * Use Case: Bread and butter ad format that can be used very versatile to deliver in-feed content as well as drive people to your website through different content types.

  * Description: Carousel ads are multiple, clickable images in succession in a single, carousel-style ad format.

  * Use Case: Best suited to show testimonials, reviews, and different product features, or tease a whitepaper.

  * Description: Video ads include a video that directly appears in the LinkedIn feed

  * Use Case: Second bread and butter ad format that is also quite versatile and is especially useful in creating a remarketing audience since you can remarket users based on video views (which is easier to get than single image clicks).

  * Description: Text ads consist of a headline, brief text, and an image and can appear at the top of the page or in the right column of a desktop view.

  * Use Case: A cost-effective way to generate a lot of impressions for very little cost. With clever copywriting they can also drive traffic - but that is secondary.

  * Description: Spotlight ads are desktop-only and appear in the right column. They are dynamic ads and are tailored to each member based on their own LinkedIn profile data, like profile photo, company name, or job title.

  * Use Case: They are similar to text ads except that they cover a bigger space and are more visually appealing due to the option of a background image and more personalization.

  * Description: (Click to) message ads consist of two parts: a single image ad that appears in the feed and a conversation in their LinkedIn inbox that appears once the user clicks on the CTA.

  * Use Case: A great way to send direct messages from a personal account which is particularly useful in remarketing when you already know that the person engaged with your company.

  * Description: Conversation ads appear in the LinkedIn inbox and are similar to a website chat as they can have multiple CTA buttons that link to different places. Conversation ad campaigns can’t target members based in the EU

  * Use Case: Similar to conversation ads except that they go directly to the LinkedIn inbox and offer more than just one CTA which can be used to give the user different options to engage with you (e.g. book a demo, learn more, download whitepaper).

  * Description: Event ads directly appear in the LinkedIn feed and require an event that is set up on LinkedIn.

  * Use Case: Best used in connection with a LinkedIn event that requires the person to fill out a registration form on the event page. However, they are usually quite expensive in generating registrations.

  * Description: Document ads promote documents directly in the LinkedIn feed and allow members to read and download the document content without leaving LinkedIn.

  * Use Case: Useful to drive in-feed content consumption (e.g. case study) as well as to generate leads by letting users “unlock” the full document in exchange for their email.

  * Description: Follower ads are desktop-only ads and appear in the right column. They are dynamic ads and are tailored to each member based on their profile photo next to your company’s logo, plus their first name and your company name.

  * Use Case: They fit in the same category as text and spotlight ads and help you cover as much digital LinkedIn “real estate” as possible.

To avoid burning through your budget too fast without seeing any positive ROI,
make sure to avoid the following mistakes.

When advertisers hear LinkedIn ads most of them think of running lead gen
forms on a cold audience to do one of the following:

  1. Promote gated ebooks, case studies, or webinars to capture email addresses which they then nurture in their CRM or hand over to sales

  2. Promote a free trial or demo call

While this might have worked 10 years ago, it rarely works nowadays. In a
recent study, [Hockeystack](https://hockeystack.com/lab-blog-posts/the-final-
verdict-demand-gen-vs-lead-gen) showed that companies with a demand gen motion
closed $57M in revenue, while companies with a lead generation motion only
closed $14.9M in revenue.

When running new campaigns I would recommend to:

  1. turn off LAN (LinkedIn audience network) since those placements are usually poor-quality

  2. turn off audience expansion since this disregards any of the targetings you previously set up

  3. switch from maximum delivery to manual CPC (take the floor bid and reduce it by 10%) since this will help you get more clicks for your budget

  4. being aware of “AND” and “OR” targeting

  5. choosing “recent” instead of “permanent” location

Most of the time campaigns were doomed to fail from the beginning because of
unrealistic expectations.

Example: Campaigns with audience sizes of 200.000, daily budgets of $20, and a
total campaign duration of 14 days.

LinkedIn ads are not a slot machine and you need to have a realistic test
scenario with a sufficient budget, creatives for different audience stages,
detailed targeting criteria, and a long enough time frame to create a
worthwhile test scenario.

Now that we have covered the things you should avoid when it comes to campaign
setup, let’s look at how to do it right.

Here are the tactical steps you need to take when setting up your first
campaign on LinkedIn

The very first thing you need to decide on is whether you want to use the
native LinkedIn targeting functions or a company upload list.

We prefer to work with company lists because this aligns your LinkedIn ads
with your sales team and it usually also gives you a smaller audience size to
work with which helps you with increasing frequency. You can do this by
uploading a CSV directly to LinkedIn or through a CRM integration.

However, if you don’t have a (good) company list and the native targeting
options on LinkedIn suffice, it is perfectly fine to go with that and define
the targeting criteria based on your ICP:

  1. Location

  2. Company size

  3. Industries

  4. Job titles OR Job function + Job seniority (you need to work with either or)

LinkedIn likes to recommend a minimum audience size of 50.000 but I have seen
campaigns work very well even with an audience size of 3.000. The size is less
important than how targeted you are. In some cases, you might even want to
create separate campaigns based on their role in the buying journey (e.g.
decision maker + users).

When setting up your audience, negative target audiences are just as important
to minimize wasted ad spend. There are three main categories:

  1. List of existing customers

  2. List of competitors

  3. Irrelevant company sizes, industries, job titles, functions, and seniorities

To accurately analyze the performance of your campaigns you need to track two
main conversion event types:

  1. Hard conversions: Measure the bottom line impact of your ads (trial signup/demo booked, deals)

  2. Soft conversions: Measure conversions that happen before hard conversions (pricing page visit, CTA click, interactive demo viewed, ebook download)

When you set up the conversion actions, I recommend setting each hard
conversion up twice. Once as the last touch - last campaign and last touch -
each campaign.

The reason for this is that a campaign might have an impact on generating
awareness (each campaign) but a different campaign was responsible for the
user to pull the trigger (last campaign).

In terms of conversion windows, we recommend to go with

  1. Hard conversions: 90-day clicks - 7-days view

  2. Soft conversions: 7-day clicks - 1-day view

When it comes to the technical setup of your conversion tracking, your best
options are:

Youur landing pages need to follow the same CRO principles that any page that
you send traffic to should follow. In a nutshell, this means you need to:

  * Position your product in people’s minds

  * Address the pain point of your audience

  * Introduce your product as a solution to that problem

  * Show functional proof that you can solve this through product features

  * Show social proof through customers, testimonials and awards

  * Provide an offer

Here are some example landing pages: [Example
1](https://www.webinargeek.com/try/german-webinar-platform), [Example
2](https://www.wordtune.com/lp), [Example 3](https://www.zoominfo.com/)

The only difference with LinkedIn ads is if you segment your campaigns by
different target audiences (e.g. decision-makers vs. users) and you want to
showcase different value propositions to different audiences.

Don’t forget that your ads run on a social network that people use to
procrastinate, edutain (educate + entertain) themselves, and connect - and all
that mainly on their phones. This is important to consider when you think
about how your ads should look like.

This means that:

  * Your ads need to stand out in the feed and stop the scroll

  * If you have posts that perform well organically you can use them as single image or video ads (also known as thought leader ads)

  * A portion of your ads should be intended to be consumed in-feed

  * The design should be optimized for mobile

  * For images 4:5, for videos 1:1 

  * Allow yourself to use humor, emotions, and raw content

You can find a great collection of example ads from
[Adfolio](https://www.adfolio.design/). Or you can use the [LinkedIn ad
library](https://www.linkedin.com/ad-library) and check on what other brands
might be doing.

When you create your first campaign structure, I usually recommend a 3
campaign group setup. To calculate the budget you can [use my Custom
GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-4zhCYU9YP-budget-calculator-for-li-ads) which
uses your CPM (you can find out an average in the campaign preview), your
audience size, a target frequency (I usually go with 7 in 30 days) and the %
of audience you reach (this is usually between 40%-50%.

  * Audience stage of awareness: Unaware - your audience doesn’t know that they have a problem

  * Goal: Make your target audience aware of your existence and their pain.

  * Target audience: Company list with LinkedIn filters on top

  *   * Content types:

    * Memes

    * Before/after images

    * Screenshots of results

    * Organic statement posts

    * 60-second product demos

    * Change in the world that creates FOMO

    * Subject matter expert talking head videos

    * In-feed value (how to's, templates, examples)

  * Audience stage of awareness: Problem/solution aware - your audience knows about their problem but they are either unaware of a solution or they know the solution but no specific product

  * Goal: Make your target audience consider you for solving their problem.

  * Target audience: 90-day remarketing audiences (website visitor, company page visitor, video viewer)

  *   * Content types:

    * Customer quotes (image/video)

    * Boosted organic customer posts

    * Cooperations with established companies

    * Podcast/live event/magazine appearances

    * Trusted 3rd party opinions (G2, Capterra, other awards)

  * Audience stage of awareness: Product aware - your audience knows that your product exists but they are not convinced of you yet

  * Goal: Make your target audience understand what's in it for them.

  * Target audience: 30-day remarketing audience (website visitor, company page visitor, video viewer)

  *   * Content types:

    * Promised land (what they could have by now)

    * Time-limited offers (e.g. extended trials)

    * Number-backed impact of doing nothing (e.g. $ saved, % better results)

    * First-touch offers (on-demand demo, product tour, trial, call)

Once you have your campaigns up and running you should check if your campaigns
hit the following benchmarks:

  * Single image: 

  * Video: 

    * View rate > 30%

    * Completion rate > 10%

    * Dwell time > 3

If you have at least 3.000€ budget per month, here are the 4 things that we
would recommend the most:

  1. Focus 100% of the budget on remarketing. If you don’t have a big enough remarketing audience (300+ people) use a very narrow company list that is ideally already in touch with you (e.g. SDR reached out)

  2.   3. Make sure that you have assets for every bucket in the user journey - awareness, engagement, and conversion.

  4. Have patience and stick with your strategy. Too often I have seen accounts being turned off after 2 weeks because they did not see any demo request come in. But when they checked the 5 weeks later they saw a new demo come in that had the first touch point LinkedIn ads.

If you have more money to spend on LinkedIn and want to expand the audience
you reach beyond remarketing, here is an example of this exact setup used by
one of my clients for a monthly budget of $12,500.
