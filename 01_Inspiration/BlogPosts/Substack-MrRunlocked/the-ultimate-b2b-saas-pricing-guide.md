A lot of early-stage SaaS founders ask me frequently.

> 💡 "What is the right pricing for my SaaS product?"

The following Ultimate guide for early-stage B2B SaaS pricing will help you
create powerful SaaS pricing for your product.

Coming up with your pricing is not easy. But also don’t make the mistake to
overcomplicate in the beginning.

If you follow:

✅ The 5 steps to get started, and

✅ The SaaS pricing fundamentals (part 2)

you’re doing great (and probably better than 90% of other startups).

It all starts with understanding your [ideal customer
profile](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-powerful-
ideal-customer?s=w) and their main pain points (you are going to solve with
your product).

Try to quantify the pain in € or hours. Doing so gives you a better
understanding of how ‘big’ the problem is for them. The bigger the problem,
the higher the value of a product that removes the pain.

Don’t make the mistake to go for cost-plus pricing or competitor-based
pricing.

Cost-plus pricing would mean you calculate your costs for offering the service
and add a margin on top (that’s what you mostly see in service businesses).

The big problem with cost-plus pricing is that your customers don’t care about
your costs, they care about the value of your product. But of course, knowing
how much it costs you to serve one additional customer (knowing your unit
economics), helps you to figure out what’s the lowest price you can offer (and
still be profitable).

Competitor pricing can be a great benchmark for your own pricing. It depends a
bit on your [SaaS
positioning](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-
positioning-6-different-ways), and how much you should care about them.

My recommendation is to go for your own pricing, follow a value-based pricing
strategy, and only check the competitors’ pricing for benchmarks if you’re in
a crowded market. If you are in a relatively crowded market (red-ocean market)
your price point needs to be competitive with your direct competition and
can’t be completely off.

**Value-based pricing**

> It basically means you’re charging your customers for the value they receive
> using your product.

A value metric is “something that a customer or prospect associates value
with” ([Chris Hopf](https://productled.com/blog/how-to-identify-your-value-
metrics-using-the-pricing-metric-decision-guide/)).

It’s basically what you charge your customers for.

Typical value metrics in B2B SaaS are:

✅ per user/seat

✅ per bookings

✅ per revenue

✅ per subscriber

✅ per contact

✅ per views

✅ and per storage (GB)

✅ Industry-specific metrics (e.g. zaps for Zapier, resources for
[Locaboo](https://www.locaboo.com/))

✅ Feature-gating as a specific type of value metric

Examples of value metrics:

  * Payment providers —> € Revenue generated / € Transaction volume

  * Email Newsletter Tool —> # of subscribers / # emails sent

  * Video hosting platform —> # videos uploaded / video storage (GB)

**The right value metric:**

  * allows you to scale with your customers (with more usage)

  * prevent users to churn (if they reduce usage) and rather naturally downgrade

  * allows you to be appealing to multiple customer segments (as you charge accordingly and not a flat fee)

So you are basically aligning your interest (grow revenue) with your
customers’ interest (getting more value).

Pricing expert [Patrick Campbell](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/saas-
pricing-strategy?s=r) says

> “a value metric however allows you to have essentially infinite price points
> — maximizing your revenue potential”.

Campbell](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/saas-pricing-strategy?s=r)
(Pricing your SaaS product); guest post in Lenny Rachitsky newsletter

How do you choose the right metric?

A powerful value metric combines the following 3 characteristics:

✅ Easy to understand

Keep it simple. Prospects need to understand it (fast) - on your pricing page
and during the sales [product
demo](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-sales-
product-demos). If it takes them too much thinking, you will lose potential
customers.

They need to see the pricing and know which pricing package is the one for
them (as they know how much of the value metric they will use in your
product).

Example: HR knows how many employees they have (e.g. per seat pricing), and
Restaurants know how many table bookings they get (e.g. per booking pricing).

✅ aligned with the customers’ value of using your product

It’s best if your interest is aligned with the customer's interest. If you
know that your customers want more bookings, charge per booking (e.g. hotel,
restaurants, sports venues, etc.). Doing so prevents you and your customers
have different interests. Being aligned helps a lot here.

✅ Scalable and grows with customers’ usage of your product

The higher the usage of the product, the more of the value metric is used, and
the higher the value of your product for the customers, which leads to a
higher willingness to pay. This means your revenue scales with the usage of
the product.

Email validation tool [Zerobounce](https://www.zerobounce.net/email-
validation-pricing/) is a great example here (value metric = email
validations).

Or webinar software [livestorm](https://livestorm.co/pricing) (charging per
contact joining webinars).

✅ (ideally) Start with only 1 value metric

✅ Only choose seats if each seat provides additional value

**Start with 1 value metric**

If you check the big successful SaaS companies nowadays, you will mostly find
pricing that’s based on a combination of 2 value metrics.

Obviously, that’s top-notch, but also very hard to execute well. It requires a
lot of testing, a lot of customer insights, and a lot of resources.

And mostly that’s what is missing most early-stage SaaS startups. So make your
job easier, keep things simple, and start with 1 value metric.

✅ Seat-based is great, but only if it works

Using users (e.g. employees) as your value metric is great. But only if each
new seat provides additional value. If not, you will see that customers share
user accounts and this will block you from adding expansion revenue. If each
user sees different things in the product, user-based pricing can work. Some
examples:

  * Time tracking tool for employees (each user need to track their specific working hours)

  * CRM for salespeople (each sales person need their own deal pipeline)

  * Project management tool (everyone needs their own task list)

If you are just starting your business the exact price point isn’t as
important as it is for later-stage companies. As [Patrick
Campbell](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/saas-pricing-strategy?s=r) said:

> “In the beginning, the actual number you're charging isn't that important.
> There are some exceptions, but for the most part, you should first be
> figuring out the range you're in: a $10 product, $100 product, $1k product,
> etc. Don't waste time debating $500 vs. $505, because this doesn't matter as
> much until you have a stronger foundation beneath you.”

In order to know if you charge the right price point, you need to measure the
value and quantify it (if possible). In case that’s possible for you (e.g.
Revenue generated like Stripe), pick this as your value metric.

In most cases, it’s rather hard to quantify. So you need to find the best
proxy for the value that your product delivers (in 99% you will find a great
proxy for the value). The best proxy for the value is your value metric.

Check out the [10x rule and the Van Westendorp
model](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-pricing-strategy) to
get into details on how to do it.

Using them allows you to find the price point(s) for your product.

Packaging means that you need to decide on the pricing tiers (how many do you
offer), what’s included in each of the tiers, and also what’s not included in
any of them (e.g. add-ons).

In case you want to package your plans around specific features (feature-
gating), that’s the time to do so. Are there specific features that are only
relevant to a specific customer type? What are the core features that need to
be part of every pricing tier?

**Limit to max. 5 plans (paradox of choice)**

Limit the number of options customers can choose from. It's called the paradox
of choice - the more options they have to choose from the harder it's for them
to make a decision.

It’s highly recommended to offer a maximum of 5 pricing tiers, better 3 to 4
different ones. Each of the pricing tiers targets a different customer
segment.

**Add a short description of what this plan is and who is it for**

This is another great way to make it clear to prospects what plan is right for
them and what costs they can expect.

**Here are some notes on packaging:**

  * Exclude features from your pricing tiers and offer them as add-ons in case they are only relevant for a few customers (and are not fundamentally important for the core product)

  * Keep the differences between the plans simple to make it easy to compare them. The mode metrics/features change between the plans, and the harder it is to get for prospects.

  * Don’t make an extensive list of features, rather highlight the most important ones

If you are already more advanced, check out Jonas Rieke's article on [data-
driven framework for SaaS packaging](https://medium.com/inside-
personio/developing-a-data-driven-packaging-for-your-saas-
product-703a67648dc4).

The last step is deciding on pricing policies including cancellation policy,
renewals, billing options, discounts, and how to handle price changes.

Let’s take a look at each of them.

What options do you have in terms of contract duration?

✅ Do you offer yearly or even 2,3,4 year contract options?

If yes, do you have the right to increase prices during that time? The more
you serve enterprise clients, the more common long-term contracts (with agreed
terms on if/how to increase prices).

You need to decide how your customers can cancel their subscriptions.

✅ for monthly paid plans: it’s common to offer monthly cancellation options.

✅ for yearly paid plans: it’s common to offer cancellation to the next billing
cycle

And as well as how customers can upgrade and downgrade during their contract.

✅ for yearly plans: most common is that customers can upgrade anytime, while
downgrading is only possible to the next billing date. For monthly plans, it’s
easier.

Make sure that contracts are automatically renewed if customers do not
actively cancel their contracts. It’s common for SaaS. Make sure that
customers know their timelines if they want to cancel.

What kind of billing options do you offer? For SaaS, the most common are
monthly payments or yearly upfront payments.

✅ Unless there is a specific reason to offer quarterly (or any other billing
cycle) stick monthly or yearly payments. It makes your and your customer’s
life easier.

Check out subscription billing tools like
[Chargebee](https://www.chargebee.com/saas-billing/),
[Stripe](https://stripe.com/de-pt) or [Paddle](https://www.paddle.com/).

Every startup gives discounts. That’s totally fair. But make sure to create a
framework on when, how, and why you give discounts. Especially if you are
following a [sales-led growth
strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-
saas-growth), how flexible is your sales team with discounts?

Here are some recommendations to start with:

✅ offer up to a maximum of 20% discount (better 10-15%) for yearly upfront
payments (vs. monthly payments)

✅ (for enterprise deals), you can also offer discounts on long-term contracts
(e.g. 3 or 5-year contracts). Of course, there are a couple of things to
consider:

  * Can we use upfront payment (cash flow and liquidity) to invest in further growth?

  * What is our annual churn rate right now, so how much is it ‘worth’ for us to lock in customers for 3 or 5 years?

Your discount policy also depends on the stage of your company (early-stage
trying to find product-market fit vs. scaling your business with 2-3x growth
per year). In both cases, it’s recommended to get something in exchange for
the discount.

In early-stage this could be:

For later-stage companies, you can offer a discount in exchange for:

Almost every startup will change its pricing over time. This means you will
get confronted with the question of how to increase prices for existing
customers.

> 💡 Do you keep existing customers on their existing plan (called
> grandfathering) or do you upgrade them to the new pricing?

Grandfathering means that your existing customers remain in your old pricing,
while only for new customers the new pricing is applied.

If you grandfather or update existing customers is a case-by-case decision.
But here are some thoughts on how to decide:

✅ If you grandfather, always offer your existing customers to switch to a new
pricing plan - especially if you restructure your plans. This makes it easier
to maintain for you over time.

✅ Communicate price changes early enough (3 months before) and focus the
communication on how the product evolved since they joined and what this means
in value for them.

✅ Combine the communication about the new pricing with releasing/communicating
new highly valuable features (doing so links the new pricing to increased
value).

✅ Send different emails to the different types of customers - existing
customers vs. trial users vs. your MQLs/SQLs - doing so can actually boost
your sales (as you say prices will increase, so now it’s a good time to get
started with the old pricing)

✅ Be aware that upgrading existing customers will result in churn. Make a
calculation on the potential upside (additional revenue) vs. the downside
(churned revenue). If you see a chance to increase revenue by 15-20% or more,
do it. If the potential upside is lower, I would rather recommend not touching
existing customers now (not worth the hustle).

Now you know how to get started with your SaaS pricing and what’s most
important for early-stage SaaS startups.

Highlighting one pricing tier (Isolation Effect) will increase your pricing
page conversion rate as humans tend to decide on products that are highlighted
or in some way 'isolated' from the rest of the options.

You can do so by highlighting with a plan with a badge (e.g. most popular),
different color, or a frame.

Make use of the fact, that humans use reference points to assess the price and
value of something. Leverage this fact and nudge customers to your preferred
tier. You achieve this expensive tier 'relatively' cheap compared to the
cheaper options, so your customers get the feeling that this is a 'great
deal'.

Offer yearly discounts (10-20% discounted) compared to monthly plans.

✅ Offer discounts for long-term contracts (e.g. yearly upfront payments)

✅ For your annual discounts, you can offer up to a 20% discount (don’t offer
more than that).

✅ Communicate the monthly price, even paid annually.

Most startups undercharge their product. There are multiple reasons for this:

❌ They don’t know the value of their product (never quantified the value; see
above)

❌ They believe being cheap helps them to win more clients (the opposite can be
true)

❌ They never strategically thought about the right price, once implemented it
never gets touched again

In order to effectively optimize your pricing, you need to collect feedback
from the market. Good sources are churn reasons (do customers churn because of
pricing?) and lost reasons (what % of deals are lost because of costs).

Responsibility for pricing is for most early-stage companies not clearly
defined.

CEO, product, sales & marketing mostly share the responsibility. Shared
responsibility means no one really feels accountable and cares about it. This
leads to almost no optimization and iteration of your pricing. Don’t make the
same mistake:

✅ Decide who is accountable for pricing in your company

✅ Establish a routine to work at least twice a year work on your pricing
strategy

Jason Lemkin recently said that you need [50 million active users for freemium
to actually work](https://www.saastr.com/you-need-50-million-users-for-
freemium-to-actually-work/).

✅ Freemium is great for later-stage startups that target a huge market.

✅ Freemium only works if you have a super large TAM (total addressable market)
and is better for well-established players (e.g. Zoom, Dropbox, Slack,
Calendly…).

If you are early stage and offer a freemium plan, you will not know if your
customer really values your product (and later on are willing to upgrade to a
paid plan).

So it’s better to go with free trials and paid plans.

Don’t hide your pricing and have a transparent pricing page.

Unless you are selling SaaS to really large customers (Enterprise market)
there is absolutely no reason to hide your pricing.

pricing.

> Productivity alone will never make your startup succeed (only Learning Speed
> will)

I am a true productivity-freak: I rigorously plan my working weeks, mostly
stick to my schedule and (almost) never miss a deadline. And I am proud of my
productivity.

Given this background, it was hard to learn that “productivity” is not what
makes a startup successful.

The success of a startup depends on its ability to find a solid product-market
fit. The key factor for achieving this is not productivity, but learning
speed—the rate at which critical hypotheses are validated. Here’s how to
optimize learning speed:

  1. **Question everything:** Actively explore the potential flaws in your startup’s most crucial assumptions. Too often founders convince themselves of something to be true that isn’t. Wishful thinking sets you up for failure.

  2. **Test leaner:** Testing assumptions often don’t even require launching an MVP. Instead: Check if there is a search volume, if people click on ads, and [experiment if they sign up](https://webflow.com/blog/validate-startup-ideas) on a landing page.

  3. **Iterate your ways of working:** Avoid long-term planning and focus on identifying and testing the most crucial assumptions. Work in short sprint cycles and use retrospectives to continuously improve your ways of working and remove barriers that hinder quick learning.

At [Echometer](https://echometerapp.com/en/), we run more than three
experiments per week, which drives our growth and informs our decision-making.
