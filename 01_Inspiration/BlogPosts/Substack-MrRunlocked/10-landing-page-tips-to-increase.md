In this article, I will share with you 10 hands-on tips for your (SaaS)
landing page.

For every early-stage startup having a great landing page is crucial. After
talking to potential customers and identifying the main problem, it's one of
the early steps to validate your idea before you work on the product ([How to
validate your product before building your product, wasting money and
time](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-validate-your-idea-
before?s=w)).

Why a great sales landing page is important for early-stage startups
(especially for SaaS):

  * great way to collect sign-ups and grow a community and

  * hopefully, convert them to free trials and [first paying customers](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/8-tips-how-to-get-your-first-10-paid)

  * storefront and first impression for potential investors and first employees

  * a key part of your performance marketing campaigns

  * branding and SEO relevance

But most of all it forces you to get specific on [who you’re targeting (your
ICP](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-powerful-
ideal-customer?s=w)), what’s your value proposition, what’s your [sales
strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-
saas-growth?s=w), and [your pricing
strategy](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/10-hands-on-tips-for-
saas-pricing?s=w).

The following 10 hands-on tips are marketing & sales specific. I am not
writing about any design or technical tips. For landing page design tips I can
highly recommend [Steve
Schoger](https://twitter.com/i/events/994601867987619840) or
[Distillery](https://distillery.com/blog/common-design-mistakes/).

Make sure you have a sticky CTA (e.g. Free Trial) in the scrolling navigation.
This will increase the visibility of your primary Call to Action and drive
conversion. Preferably only your CTA button is sticky (and not the rest of the
menu).

A great landing page consists of [different
sections](https://webflow.com/blog/high-converting-landing-page), including a
[hero](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/how-to-high-converting-saas-homepage)
section, problem section, solution section, How it works, Social Proof,
[Pricing](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/10-hands-on-tips-for-
saas-pricing), and FAQs. Make sure that you have a CTA button in every section
of your landing page.

Think about a powerful Call To Action button. Maximum 3 words. The more
powerful the message of your CTA, the higher the conversion. Here are some
powerful CTAs:

  * Get started

  * Free trial

  * Book a demo

  * Sign up free

  * 14-day free trial

  * Request access

  * Join waitlist

Align your sales strategy with your CTA - [talk to sales for sales-led growth
and free trial for product-led
growth.](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-
saas-growth?s=w)

Social proof is great to become trustworthy. It's especially important for
young startups without strong branding. Provide testimonials from first
customers who have benefited from your product. Share their unique story and
how they benefit from your solution. The goal is that your visitors relate to
your testimonials. Test the following social proofs:

  * testimonials of your customers (Testimonial videos, quotes, and images)

  * share number of happy customers (e.g. Join 100+ happy customers)

  * pr coverage (e.g. featured in Forbes, Huffington Post, ProductHunt, Techcrunch..)

80% of the visitors only read the headlines, and only 20% read the rest of
your landing page. So make sure you nailed your headlines. The headline
captures the attention of the visitors.

Here are some tips for headlines:

  * aim for 6 words headlines - keep them short

  * use a dark color to make them easy to read (contrast of colors)

  * include strong words and adjectives

  * include (odd) numbers (e.g. 105% increase of revenue)

  * use action headlines (e.g. Get Free Access today)

A [conversational tone](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-homepage-
copywriting-guide) means you try to write the way you would normally talk to
your customer. You’re not trying to impress them with your vocabulary (not too
technical or industry jargon). Talk directly to the visitor of your landing
page, speak to one person and ask questions. Make sure the language you choose
fits your [target customer persona](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-
ideal-customer-profile). Conversational tone works better for products
targeting consumers, prosumers, and SMBs, not perfect for enterprise
customers.

Keep the copy short and simple. A good rule of thumb is that every section
should not have more than 3-5 lines of text. Make sure that you speak the
language of your target customer. A common mistake is having too many details
or too technical text, not optimized to convert visitors to leads. Your
landing page is basically a sales page with the goal to convert sign-ups.

It can make sense to add exit pop-ups to your landing page. They stop visitors
before they leave your page with the goal to collect their email addresses.
Popular exit pop-up call-to-action are free e-books, webinar invites, special
discounts, or gifts. Be creative and add value to your visitor.

Another interesting strategy for collecting email addresses (and converting
them later to product sign-ups) is using engaging elements like revenue
calculators, lead quizzes, or videos. The goal is to engage visitors with your
content on your page and send them the result via email (e.g. revenue
potential) in exchange for their email. Make sure you have good email
marketing automation/follow-up emails in place.

Visitors love product demo videos. It's an easy and engaging way to check out
your product. If you are early-stage it's fine if your product demo is
produced on a low budget (a great tool to do screen recordings for product
demo videos is [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) \- check out the [best digital
tools for startups](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/best-tools-for-
start-ups-and-digital)). Here are some tips for a good product video:

  * keep it short (under 2 minutes)

  * use some background music or talk to the viewer

  * if it's a personal screen recording, then show your face to make it more personal

  * don't explain features, talk about values and benefits

In the solution section of your landing page, focus on selling the benefits of
your product and don't just explain the features. The only reason why your
product has those features is that they are (hopefully) beneficial for your
customers. You need to sell values, not features. For example: if you are
building a _[marketing automation
tool](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/best-tools-for-start-ups-and-
digital)_ and offer a feature called _automated follow-ups_ , the benefits of
this feature are for instance:

  * higher response rate

  * increased retention rate

  * higher engagement

  * happy customers

  * more sales

People love to see what the product looks like. Use high-quality product
images - and try to barely use any stock images. And keep in mind that the
images need to correspond to the text of this section.
