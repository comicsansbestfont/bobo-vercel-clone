As a founder you always ask yourself:

“When is the right time to scale the business?”

Knowing when it’s the right time to spend more money on acquisition and adding
more people to the team.

You often hear about 2 types of founders.

**1️⃣ Invest too early**

Some startups/founders, especially if they raised their first investment,
invest too early. They hire a lot of people and spend €€€ on paid channels. If
you do this before product-market fit, you will burn a lot of money (without
growing your business).

**2️⃣ Invest too late (or never)**

Quite the opposite of the first type of founders. They have great metrics and
strong signals that they are ready to scale, but still don’t do it. They
always feel…

> “there is one more thing to do and then we can double down”

So finding the right timing is not easy. But here are 3 indicators that make
it easier to hit the right timing.

The 3 scale-readiness indicators are:

  1. Product Market Fit

  2. Repeatable Growth

  3. Internal Readiness

Let’s dive into each of them.

Product-market fit is what all early-stage founders want to achieve.

It’s an approach to measure if customers are satisfied with your product and
tell others about it.

✅ How satisfied are your customers with the product?

✅ Are they raving about your product?

✅ Do they tell others to use it?

If you want to measure product market fit, choose one of the following
metrics.

1️⃣ **(logo) churn rate**

Do customers stick to your product? Measure the % of your paying customers
that churn every month (or year). Compare your churn rate with industry and
customer segment (SMB vs. enterprise clients) benchmarks. Good churn rates can
vary between 1-3% up to 10% or more per month.

2️⃣ **(usage) retention rate**

If you’re early stage and sell lots of yearly contracts, logo churn rate on a
monthly base can give you wrong signals. So instead of waiting till the end of
the contract period and hoping for the best, track the product usage retention
of your customers.

If clients reduce/stop using your product, it’s an early indicator of future
churn.

Ideally, you see the opposite, so they get more active every month.

3️⃣ **Sean Ellis test**

This test is simple but very powerful. You run a survey and ask your customers
how they would feel if they could no longer use the product.

> How would you feel if you could no longer use the product?

You give them 3 options to choose:

☑️“very disappointed”

☑️ “somewhat disappointed”

☑️“not disappointed”

You hit product-market fit if 40% and more choose “very disappointed”.

To scale, you need repeatable and predictable growth.

Repeatable means:

  * one or more channels, that you know consistently brings in news leads

  * messaging that resonates with your [ICP](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile) and converts them to paying clients

In short: Channel-Market fit and Message-Market.

Predictable means:

  * you know how it costs you to acquire a new customer (aka. customer acquisition costs)

  * you know how much revenue you make with a new customer (aka. customer lifetime value)

  * and how much it costs you to keep the client 

In short: Good unit economics

Repeatable and predictable growth allows you to scale.

Even if you hit product-market fit and find repeatable and predictable growth,
you need to prepare internally for scaling.

And internal readiness is what most founders forget about.

You and your team need to be ready to add new team members and spend more
money on marketing and sales.

Here are some things to consider:

✅ Playbooks (e.g. Sales Playbooks)

✅ Onboarding plans

✅ Org Chat & team structure

✅ Reportings & Meeting formats

✅ Compensation plans (e.g. for your sales team)

✅ Tools & Tech stack (ready to use for more users)

👉 You’re ready to scale your SaaS, if you can say yes to **Product Market
Fit** , **Repeatable and predictable Growth** , and **Internal Readiness**.

The problem section is a key section on your SaaS homepage.

👉 Get the [perfect SaaS Homepage Template](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-
perfect-homepage-for-early-stage-saas)

With this section, you set the context.

You connect with the visitor and present them with their ‘shitty’ status quo.

All before you introduce your product as the right solution.

This section mainly has 2 reasons for existing:

1️⃣ Tell the visitors about their ‘shitty’ status quo, so they know they have
a problem (that’s worth fixing).

2️⃣ (dis)qualify visitors: if they do not resonate with this section, there’s
a high chance that your product is NOT relevant to them.

If you ignore this section, you assume that your customers know about their
shitty status quo.

One great way to design the problem section is a comparison of

**The 'old way'**

**vs.**

**The 'new way'**

Here are some great examples of old vs. new way.

People who visit your pricing page have usually some sort of buying intention.
Today I want to share with you some hands-on quick fixes for your pricing
page.

3 things that I like about their pricing page

1️⃣ Adding logos for social proof

2️⃣ Highlight 20% discount for yearly plan

3️⃣ Highlighting 'popular' plan

And 2 things that would make it even better (IMO):

1️⃣ Adding 1-sentence below each plan (who is this for)

2️⃣ Isolating the 'popular' plan a bit more (e.g. different color)

1️⃣ Adding a ROI focused quote --> Customer quote on the value surfe brings
compared to the cost

2️⃣ short tagline who the plan is for --> Describes (indirectly) the target
audience for each plan

3️⃣ Highlighting the savings for yearly plan --> Make the yearly plan more
attractive

4️⃣ Isolating the most popular plan --> Nudge people to their preferred plan

1️⃣ Add customer logos to your pricing tiers

Logos are a great way to add social proof.

You can add on each pricing plan:

🔸 2-3 logos/names that use this plan

🔸add 'used by' or 'Helps companies like...'

Doing so will help your visitors to know which plan is right for them.

Because either they know that they are similar to the ones mentioned, or that
they want to be like them.**
