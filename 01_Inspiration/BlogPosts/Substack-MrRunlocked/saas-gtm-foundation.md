Building the GTM foundation with founders on their way to product-market fit
is what I’ve been doing for 3+ years now.

But I’ve realized that all the content we’ve covered so far on MRRunlocked (90
episodes so far) has been about specific parts of GTM from €0 to €1 million
ARR.

Some episodes have been deep dives into specific channels (e.g., [Google
Ads](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/google-ads-guide),
[Allbound](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/allbound-playbooks), [Founder-Led
LinkedIn](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/founder-led-linkedin-guide)), while
others touched parts of the GTM strategy (e.g., Messaging or Pricing).

But what has been missing so far is a piece that puts it all together, so you
exactly know what it takes to grow from €0 to €1 million.

**Your GTM foundation**.

Without a strong foundation, your GTM org will come crumbling down.

**I call it a powerful GTM foundation.**

But before we deep-dive into how to build your GTM foundation, let’s have a
quick refresh on the [10 most common GTM
myths](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-gtm-myths). 👇

Now that we have the myths out of our way, let’s look at the 3 stages that
founders need to cross to go from €0 to €1 million ARR.

A lot of times, you read about the 0 to 1 stage. I rather believe the 0-1
stage consists of at least 3 (sub) stages.

But once you have achieved stage 3, you hit product-market fit. Congrats 🎉

**Product Market Fit = Problem Solution Fit (Stage 1) + GTM Fit (Stage 2)**

So when I talk about GTM Foundation, this combines GTM experimentation (Stage
1) & GTM Playbook V1 (Stage 2).

**GTM Foundation = GTM Experimentation (Stage 1) + GTM Playbook V1 (Stage 2)**

So let’s take a closer look.

Your goal is to find the first 10 / 100 customers (depending on your ACV).

You will run different tests. You want to validate your hypothesis, so you do
any and everything to land that first set of customers.

**I call this GTM Experimentation.**

❌ But you will most likely end up with different customer types and different
use cases in this process. This is very hard to grow and scale.

✅ So you need to focus on your [best-fit
customers](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/analyze-your-icp) and, for the time
being, niche down to one segment and use-case.

This is how you reach stage 2.

The goal is to go beyond 10 / 100 customers.

But you can’t do this while serving multiple segments and multiple channels
because each of them requires different strategies and resources to work.

So, how do you do this?

[Analyze your early customers (Early Customer Profile) to find your best-fit
customers (Ideal Customer Profile)](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/analyze-
your-icp) and focus on them till you scale to €1 million ARR.

Signs of best-fit customers are

✅ Higher product usage,

✅ Lower churn,

✅ Faster sales cycles,

✅ Higher win rates,

✅ Higher ACVs.

Focus on one channel, one use-case, and one ICP. If you are at this stage and
want to learn more, check [this](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/analyze-your-
icp) out.

**I call this GTM Playbook V1.**

Once you have achieved that, congrats. You hit product market fit.

Here, your goal is to go beyond 1 million ARR. You can do this in three ways -

1️⃣ **Vertically** \- Same target audience (aka. ICP), but new use cases

2️⃣ **Horizontally** \- Same use case, but new target audiences

or

3️⃣ Simply continue what you already do if there is a big enough market.
**Double-down/scale.**

So now we know the 3 stages from 0€ to 1€ million ARR and beyond.

To get there, you need to build your GTM foundations.

**The GTM foundation spread over: GTM Experimentation + GTM Playbook V1**

Now, it’s time to get in the trenches and build your GTM foundations.

Building the GTM foundations for SaaS founders on their journey from 0 to €1
million ARR is exactly what I do in my [1-on-1 GTM
advisory](https://www.alexestner.com/services/gtm-advisory).

The following sections should act as your guide in navigating through the
challenges of building your GTM foundation.

So we don’t go into details, rather link to relevant materials. But at the
end, you know exactly what you need to create/master to have a strong GTM
foundation.

**The 10 elements of a strong GTM foundation:**

  1. Ideal Customer Profile

  2. Positioning

  3. Messaging

  4. GTM Collaterals

  5. Channels

  6. Pricing

  7. Sales Motion

  8. CRM & Tracking

  9. Forecasting & Planning

  10. Internal Operating Systems

Let’s start with what your ICP is.

Your ICP is NOT your Total Addressable Market (TAM).

> **Your TAM = The big market you sell to your investors**
>
> **Your ICP = The part of the market that you target today with your
> product**
>
> **Your ECP = A sub-segment of your ICP, that is easier to win early on.**

It’s important to understand that your ICP will change over time.

The 'ideal' customers in the 0 to 100k € is different than your 'ideal'
customers from 1€ million to 5€ million etc.

So live with the fact that your ICPs will change over time.

Think about it this way: Your ICP today brings you to your next milestone.

Once you hit the next milestone, you can revisit your ICP.

These are your first 10-100 customers. You usually find them via your
[network, referrals, and capturing high
intent](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/155000783/tactics-that-i-would-test-in-
to-get-the-first-customers), as part of your “Hustle Mode”.

And they might be different from your ICP, in that they are:

  * Solution aware

  * In the market

  * Experimental

Whereas your ICP might be:

  * not yet solution aware

  * harder to reach

  * Require proof of work

> Again, in your hustle phase, you will most likely end up with different
> customer types and multiple use cases. Not ideal to grow.

To do this, use a step-by-step process where you

1️⃣ Define your ‘better fit’ indicators

2️⃣ Collect data on your customers

3️⃣ Break down your base into segments

4️⃣ Analyze them against metrics that are indicators or ‘better fit’

Once you have identified your ‘better-fit’ customers, write down their
characteristics. Get specific.

A powerful ICP consists of two parts:

**1️⃣ Ideal Company**

**2️⃣ Ideal Persona (User + Buyer)**

  * Who are these people

  * What are their JTBD, challenges, responsibilities, KPIs, metrics

  * What they consume, where they hang out, and what their day-to-day looks like

  * Trigger events and buying signals

But to keep things also ‘handable’, I recommend having:

  * the ICP framework above (with lots of information on your ICP), but also

  * a short ICP based on 4-5 criteria. These are the ones that you use in your day-to-day operations (e.g. [building lists in LinkedIn Sales Navigator](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/linkedin-sales-navigator-guide)).

You can use my [ICP framework in
Miro](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile) to build
your ICP version.

It’s super powerful to be specific about who you do NOT want to serve.

This is sometimes easier done than your ICP.

**Here’s my Anti ICP**

Understand who you DO NOT WANT as your customers.

To find them, ask yourself questions like, what type of companies have

  * long sales cycles and low win rates

  * low contract value

  * high churn rates

  * high support volume

  * low engagement and satisfaction

  * You don’t enjoy working with

Once you know the criteria of your ICP, make sure to track the information on
your CRM.

Only if you consistently collect the info can you analyze data and fine-tune
your ICP over time.

So let’s start with what positioning is.

**So, in a nutshell, positioning means having clarity on:**

1️⃣ **Who** benefits from your product = _Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)  
_ 2️⃣ **What** your product does = _Product Category and/or Primary Use Case  
_ 3️⃣ **Why** it’s better than the default option = _Limitations of Status Quo
+ Your Key Benefits  
_ 4️⃣ **How** it’s different from other alternatives = _Unique Differentiator
/ Positioning Angle_

…and being able to **clearly communicate this** across your product,
marketing, and sales touchpoints.

To answer these core questions, you need to ask yourself:

  * Who is your direct & indirect competition?

  * What is your primary competitor (aka. status Quo)?

  * What sets you apart from the status quo (aka. limitations and benefits)?

  * How are you different from your direct competitors (aka. unique differentiator)?

So to help you get tactical on this, let’s have a look at some frameworks.

One of the best ways to answer “What is your product? For what do I use the
product?” is to know your:

  * Product Category and/or

  * Usecase

There is a great visual by Fletch for this.

So, you need to take a positioning decision:

**Use Case Positioning vs. Product Category Positioning**

In a nutshell, do this:

✅ **Product Category positioning** : if you’re building a product in an
established market

→ Good indicator: you will find a category on G2, Capterra, etc., and there’s
existing search demand on Google & co.

✅ **Use case positioning** : if you’re building a product in a rather new
market (blue ocean); no established product category has been built yet.

→ Good indicator: No product category on G2, Capterra, etc.

This is step 1. Next, you need to add how you are different.

Unique differentiator = Something that you have that your competition does
not.

This can be a specific feature or the fact that you serve a specific market
better (e.g. being GDPR compliant, if you sell to the DACH market).

To find your differentiator, have a look at 6 established positioning angles.

There are [6 different angles](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/saas-
positioning-6-different-ways) you can use to position your product

  1. Niche down

  2. Low-cost player

  3. Premium player

  4. Unique benefit

  5. Being the ‘lite’ player of something complex

  6. Mix of the above

We also covered [positioning in the Founder-Led LinkedIn
Guide](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/155327506/step-positioning-and-messaging-
differentiation-in-the-market).

It helps to create a visualisation where you are compared to your [direct &
indirect competition](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/i/135824254/the-types-of-
competitors-for-your-saas).

Messaging is what you say/communicate in all your customer-facing
communication. It is how you ‘turn your positioning’ into something tangible.

Your messaging is built on [5 parts](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-
ultimate-saas-messaging-framework), including

  * Market

  * ICP

  * Competitive alternatives

  * Product

  * Value proposition

We won’t go into details today. But if you need to work on your messaging,
check out this [Miro Template ](https://miro.com/miroverse/ultimate-saas-
messaging-framework-template/)(used by 4000+ startups)

[Get Free Messaging Framework](https://miro.com/miroverse/ultimate-saas-
messaging-framework-template/)

Based on the above messaging framework, create a short version.

Something that you use in the elevator :) And if you don’t use it in the
elevator, it’s powerful for your LinkedIn profile, Homepage hero section,
Email campaigns, Google Ads, LinkedIn posts, and so much more.

Create your version of the 1-sentence value proposition and then use it as
often as possible and iterate on it.

Every conversation with potential clients is a chance to train. This is how
you’ll be able to best convey what your SaaS does and pitch it naturally.

Every SaaS founder will come across
[objections](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/how-to-handle-top-customer-
objections) in the early days.

It’s best to know how to handle them. Use my concern-handling[
template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YnHpZnao-
xoADNs0tVpXJTkXATBCiU2bei7kRRyrwB8/edit?usp=sharing) to make this process more
efficient.

Another powerful tactic is to create a “Customer Language Swipe File” - a
place where you collect words/phrases from sales calls & interviews with your
customers. A goldmine for copywriting.

Once we have covered Steps 1 to 3, we can turn these insights into our GTM
collaterals.
