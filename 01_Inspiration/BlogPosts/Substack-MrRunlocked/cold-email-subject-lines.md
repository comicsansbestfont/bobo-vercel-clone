The subject line is key for your open rates.

If no one opens your email, your best email copy is useless.

So don’t ignore the importance of your subject lines.

✅ Solution for your {pain point}

Sales demos are key to the success of your business.

If you get leads to book a sales demo with you, you need to perform.

Otherwise, they will move on to your competition.

Below you find 9 actionable sales demo tips that you can apply today.

A sales demo is more than just presenting your features.

The demo meeting consists of:

One of the most common mistakes I see over and over is to skip step 2 and step
4.

No pain points?

No product demo!

Only if you do a great sales discovery, you can rock your product demo.

Because a demo is not just 'showing features'. It's about selling values.

You are 'showing' features (e.g via screen sharing), BUT you are 'talking'
values.

Better discovery leads to higher win rates.

From weak intentions to unfolding true pain points.

Find out what really drives the client.

It's actually easier than you think:

1️⃣ Ask open questions

2️⃣ Ask a lot of 'W' questions

3️⃣ Ask 'Why is that?" at least 5xtimes

4️⃣ Don't jump from one question to the other. Dig deeper and try to really
understand the situation of the client.

5️⃣ Repeat what you understood. Ask them if you understood them correctly.

Questions.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexander-estner_b2bsales-

You will unfold the pain points of your customers.

It's important that you don't just assume them.

Let your customers confirm their pain.

𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝟯 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗼 𝗱𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁:👇

1️⃣ You: _"Did I understand correctly, that you are having XYZ problem, which
leads to (negative result 1) and (negative result 2)?"_

2️⃣ You: _"So what you said is that you already tried (alternative solution 1)
and (alternative solution 2), but it didn't solve the problem because of XYZ.
Is that correct?"_

3️⃣ You: _"So, what I've noted down, is that it's the top priority for you to
solve problem X, because if you can't solve it, it will have (negative
implication 1) and (negative implication 2). Correct?"_

Don't pitch all you have. Only what's needed.

It's not that the more the better.

Most of the time, it's the opposite.

Focus on the core features of your product. On the ones that relate to the
customers' pain points.

Show them how these features solve their problem.

This means that you share your screen and show them your features.

But don’t say what you’re doing.

Don't say things like:

_‘If you click here, then XYZ happens.”_

 _"This feature is also great, you just click here, and then x happens and
then you just click here and then Y happens"._

Those are all things you are showing, but not saying.

Instead, tell them why this feature is beneficial for them.

After you showed them a feature, ask for their feedback.

Get a conversation going.

Because it shouldn’t be a monologue or presentation.

You need to make sure that they keep following you and most importantly if
what you are showing them really solves their pain (or if they understood
how/if your product could solve their pain).

**So here are a few ways to do this: 👇**

  *  _“Would this (what I’ve shown you) solve the problem about X (what you’ve mentioned and confirmed earlier)?_ “

  *  _“Do you see how that solves your challenge with X”?_

  * _“What impact would this have on your job?”_

  *  _“Can you see yourself/your team using this in your organization?”_

One thing that I see a lot of times with junior salespeople or non-sales
founders, is that they think talking more and using buzzwords help them win
customers.

It's actually the opposite.

Better do this:

1️⃣ LISTENING MORE

2️⃣ USE SIMPLE WORDS

3️⃣ GUIDE BY ASKING QUESTIONS

Your goal should be to understand the customers' problems.

The best salespeople listen more than 50% of the time.

They lead the conversation by asking the right questions.

At the end of your sales demo, you should summarize the pain points and how
you solve them (on a high-level).

Agree on concrete next steps (e.g. decision call on date X or Q&A Session next
XYZ).

Plus, always follow up after the sales demo.

A great sales demo follow-up email helps you to decrease your sales cycle and
win more deals.

If you’re doing cold calls, the chances are high that you frequently face
‘gatekeepers’.

Gatekeepers are real and so hard to overcome.

But if you handle them right, you will get more decision-maker calls.

**Here are 3 ways to overcome them 👇**

𝟭\. 𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗯𝗲𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀

In your call opener, relate to something that happened recently (=trigger
event).

This could be for instance: the decision maker joining an event, social media
post, press article, engagement with your product (e.g. signup), or
communication (opened an email today).

This could sound the following:

You: _"Hey, this is Alex from (company name). I saw that (name of decision
maker) (trigger event)._

_Could you please connect me with (name of decision maker)?”_

The gatekeeper responds: _"Okay, and what do you want from him/her?"_

Then you need to add either something valuable or create
urgency/curiosity/relevance.

The gatekeeper then sees value in connecting you with the right person.

You (for signup trigger): "_Just wanted to make sure that he/she got all the
information to move forward with this important decision (e.g. for signup)"_

or

You (for social media posts): _"Just wanted to share some relevant tips on how
other companies reacted to a similar situation"_

𝟮\. 𝗔𝘀𝗸 𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗸𝗲𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗽

By asking the gatekeeper for help, they feel seen and powerful.

Appreciate their work.

Don't act like they 'stop' you from doing your work, rather turn them into
your best friend.

You: _"Hey (name of gatekeeper), is (the one you want to reach) available?"_

Gatekeeper: _"No"_

You: _"As (name of the decision maker) is responsible for (relevant topic), I
need to get in touch with her/him. Could you help with that?"_

𝟯\. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲𝘀

By adding relevant references in your call opener, the importance of your call
increases.

The gatekeeper labels you as a 'priority'.

At least not as a spammer.

You are different than the other 99% of calls. It creates FOMO.

You: _"Hey, this is Alex calling. (Name of reference) told me that (specific
topic or problem) is not only relevant to them but also for (name of company).
To make sure that this is true, could you connect me with (name of decision
maker), as she/he is responsible for (the topic you want to discuss)."_

Of course, it doesn't work 100%.

👉 What's your best way to overcome gatekeepers?
* * *

Enjoy it while you're doing it.

You can't postpone having a good time to later because that (shockingly) might
never happen. Fall in love with the process, not the outcome.

Building a company is hard. But also incredibly rewarding at times.

It takes consistency and it's easier to achieve that if you enjoy what you're
doing. If you enjoy the process of getting there, independent of the outcome
you will achieve.

This doesn't mean completely detaching from your company. Rather, this is
about playing an infinite game, that you can sustain in the long term. If you
find fulfillment (or even joy) in your work despite (or even because) of the
challenges ahead of you, you've already won.
