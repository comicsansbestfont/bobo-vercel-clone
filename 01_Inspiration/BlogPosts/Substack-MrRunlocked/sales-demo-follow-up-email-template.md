Sales demos are the central element of a sales-led growth strategy.

Most sales teams do send follow-up emails after demos. But most of them just
send a quick email with a contract attached, but they don’t use them as
another touchpoint to ‘sell’ your product. A great follow-up email reinforces
the value of your solution.

Your sales demo follow-up email should include:

  * short summary of the discovery (restate the main challenge & goal)

  * highlight the top 3 solutions/benefits of your product

  * answer open questions

  * a clear outline of the next steps

Also, make sure that your email is:

There is of course not ‘the perfect one and only’ follow-up email template,
but here is one that I personally like a lot. It’s perfect for selling to SMBs
and products below 20k€ annual contract value.

Most founders jump right into growth tactics. They want to spread the word.
They want to be present on all [different growth
channels](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-21-saas-gtm-channels). They want
to reach everyone.

But...

Running google ads is a tactic, not a strategy. Writing blog posts is a
tactic, not a strategy. Doing cold emails is a tactic, not a strategy.

Without a clear strategy, you will attract 0 clients. Your conversion rates
will be very low and you’ll burn your money. 🔥

GTM Strategy first, then growth tactics.

But…

Creating a GTM strategy doesn't need to take months to do. It also doesn't
need to be a 50-page-long Google Doc. That's why I've put together a simple
one-pager Notion template that covers the most important elements of your GTM
strategy.

Jobs to be done are a key part of your [ideal customer
profile](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-powerful-
ideal-customer).

It’s basically why someone is ‘hiring’ your product. And of course, different
user types have different needs.

I love the way [Close](https://refer.close.com/alex) addresses them on its
website.

They have a section for every user type.

They have 3 main jobs to be done for every user type.

It makes it so clear why someone should 'hire' your product.

> Horizontal SaaS products cannot be marketed horizontally. Instead, vertical
> personas, use cases, or industries are required to be effective.

The biggest mistake you can make as a marketer for a horizontal product is
going too broad. Broad shows up in two ways:

**1/ Broad in messaging** In this scenario, you’re using a wider message to
try and teach a large audience. And it won't work because it will lack the
clarity for an individual to engage.

**2/ Broad in resourcing** In this scenario, you are using targeted messaging,
which is great. But you are doing it with too many different audiences at
once. This doesn't work because in your early stage you will have limited
resources to put together the marketing materials needed to support these
different segments.

**The solution to this challenge?**

  1. Experiment to find a targeted segment that aligns the best with your product

  2. Double down with a focus on that segment until you have made the marketing for that segment 100% operational

  3. Move on sequentially to the next segment until you have covered them all

challenge, you can read more about Horizontal GTM phases

I can highly recommend [lemlist](https://www.lemlist.com/) if you want to do
powerful (multi-channel) sales outbound campaigns.

It’s super easy to personalize cold emails, automate follow-ups, and engage
with leads across different channels (especially email + LinkedIn engagement).

Only downside: In my opinion, the UX/UI is a bit complex and not so easy to
keep an overview.
