Founders ask me a lot about how they know that they are ready to scale. When
is the right time to hire more people and invest more money in marketing?

Finding the right timing is not easy. Some founders invest way too early, and
doing so will burn a lot of money. While others already have pretty good signs
but are still hesitant to double down and start to scale.

**𝟭\. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁-𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁 𝗙𝗶𝘁**

Product-Market Fit tries to quantify the following:

✅ How satisfied are your customers with the product?

✅ Are they raving about your product?

✅ Do they tell others to use it?

You can use these 3 metrics as indicators:

1️⃣ **(logo) churn rate**

Measure how many of your existing customers are churning every month.
Depending on the customer segment (enterprise vs. prosumers), this can vary
from 3% up to 10% or more per month.

2️⃣ **(usage) retention rate**

But not only logo churn is an indicator. Also, keep track of how your existing
customers use your product. Ideally, you see that they get more active every
month. This means that they see the value in your product and keep using it.
Especially if you only offer yearly plans, it can be a pitfall to only track
logo churn (because you realize too late that they never really used the
product and then churn).

Tip: Do a cohort-based analysis to see if new users show better retention
rates (as your product involves).

3️⃣ **Sean Ellis test**

Another great way to measure whether people love your product is the Sean
Ellis test. You literally ask your existing users in a quick survey how they
would feel if they could no longer use the product.

> _**How would you feel if you could no longer use the product?**_

And you offer them 3 options: “very disappointed” / “somewhat disappointed” /
“not disappointed”

If 40% or more say they would be “very disappointed” if they can no longer use
your product, you achieved product-market fit.

Product-Market fit shows you if your product is valuable for the market.

Channel-Market and Message-Market fit tells you if you found the [right
channels](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-21-saas-gtm-channels) with the
[right message to acquire new customers](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-
ultimate-saas-messaging-framework) in a repeatable and profitable way.

So do you have a clear answer to:

✅ Do you know which growth channels work for you?

✅ Can you consistently create pipelines and new clients?

✅ Do you know how much it costs you to acquire and retain new customers?

Before you scale you as a company (team + processes) need to be ready. Imagine
you onboard 10 new team members but you haven’t implemented proper guidelines
and playbooks. Or you can’t tell them their objectives and what they need to
do to achieve them. Each of them would work differently and would risk the
success of your business.

That’s why you, your team, and your organization need to be ready to add new
team members.

Here are some things to consider:

✅ Playbooks (e.g. Sales Playbooks)

✅ Onboarding plans

✅ Org Chat & team structure

✅ Role descriptions

✅ Reportings & Meeting formats

✅ Compensation plans (e.g. for your sales team)

✅ Tools & Tech stack (ready to use for more users)

If you can say yes to all three, congratulations! You're ready to put the
pedal to the metal and scale up your business 🚀

I’m talking a lot about the [ideal customer
profile](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-powerful-
ideal-customer) \- what it is, how to get the 2 [key elements of a powerful
ICP](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-2-parts-of-a-powerful-
ideal-customer) right - it’s even the longest section in my SaaS growth
strategy [Workbook](https://alexestner.gumroad.com/l/saas-growth-worksheet).

So I’m not exaggerating if I say

> ‘The ICP is the backbone of your GTM’

So choosing a different ICP impacts all your GTM decisions. Let’s take the
example of selling CRM software (this is just a theoretical example to make it
really tangible).

You could build a new CRM for freelancers, consultants, and creators (even
here there are multiple niches) or you try to compete against the big
incumbents like Hubspot and Salesforce and target larger companies.

Taking one or either has a huge impact on the rest of your GTM.

When you’re talking to the freelancers and creators, the **status quo** you’ll
find is that they either do not have a CRM at all or use tools like Notion,
Google Sheets, or Gmail to keep track of their clients. They have a very
‘basic’ approach to their CRM. And they have maybe 20 new prospects in their
pipeline, manually managed.

Their **problem** with the existing set-up (**Current way of doing X**) will
be limited features (no pipeline view, no reports on conversion, hard to keep
an overview, no task feature…). For Salesforce Users, the reality would be
different. They complain about huge costs (per seat pricing) and that
Salesforce/Hubspot is hard to maintain (super complex settings).

Their **motivations to fix the problem** are different. While solopreneurs
want to create a system, that reduces manual work and saves time to focus on
their actual job to be able to win more customers. Larger companies,
especially in times like these, look for ways to reduce costs and find ways to
make their existing workforce more efficient.

This means your **value proposition** is a different one. Your **messaging**
will be around why freelancers need a CRM at all and why it’s better than
using Notion or Excel.

And as you serve different customer types, your **product strategy** will vary
a lot. A freelancer CRM will focus on a lean user interface, simple settings,
clear use cases & templates, and single-user mode - all self-serve.

As freelancers are solopreneurs, your **pricing** won’t be per-seat. Rather
you would try to keep the entry barrier low (as they are very price sensitive)
and go for a freemium model. In terms of [value
metric](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-pricing-strategy), you
will probably choose leads (or go for a [feature based
pricing](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/saas-pricing-strategy),
where you gate premium features in your paid plans)

So your average contract value will be for sure below 100€ MRR, this means
your **sales motion** will be [product-
led](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-saas-
growth) (as you can’t afford an expensive [sales-
led](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/product-led-vs-sales-led-saas-
growth) sales team). This means that you’ll pick different [growth channels
like SEO or
Referrals](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/12-powerful-b2b-saas-
channels-for) \- and not outbound sales for instance.

This obviously affects your **sales process** \- you will optimize for a free
trial (and not [book a sales
demo](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-sales-
product-demos)) as your main CTA and work a lot on your product onboarding to
get customers as fast as possible to the aha moment ([13 powerful tips for
SaaS activation](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/13-powerful-tips-
on-activating-more)).

And of course, the list goes on. You will hire a different team with different
skill sets, track different SaaS metrics, invest in different growth channels,
and think differently in terms of internalization/expansion.

Yes, a lot of the huge SaaS companies target different ICPs, from enterprises
to Prosumers. But always remember that each of them started in their early
days with one clear target audience. So try to remember:

_**One ICP = One dominant sales motion**_

Once you mastered this ICP you can add a new segment. But make sure you have
enough resources to properly target this new segment.

So you can move from pure PLG to product-led sales (sales assisted) and then a
sales-led layer on top. Keep in mind that each of the 3 motions requires
dedication and expertise.

Being in SaaS and Working with early-stage B2B SaaS startups and being in SaaS
since 2014, I frequently come across common misconceptions. Today I will share
with you 9 of my personal favorites 😄

1️⃣ **Go to Market (GTM)**

**→ ❌ Growth Tactics**

**→ ✅ Strategy first + execution (tactics)**

A powerful GTM is always the combination of a GTM strategy and execution. The
tactics are ‘just’ one part of the execution.

2️⃣ **Sales**

**→ ❌ Selling features**

**→ ✅ Solving problems**

It’s not enough to just show prospects all the cool features of your product.
The sales job is connecting the dots, how your features enable them to do
things better/faster/cheaper than before, that fixes their problem and brings
them results in X.

3️⃣ **Marketing**

**→ ❌ running ads & content **

**→ ✅ Messaging & value proposition**

Only once you really understand your ICP you can build a powerful value
proposition and messaging. The ads and content are again ‘just’ the execution
of it.

4️⃣**Customer Success**

**→ ❌ Handling customer requests**

**→ ✅ onboard new & upsell existing**

Customer Success is not customer support.

5️⃣ **SDR/BDR**

**→ ❌ Modern call center**

**→ ✅ understand ICP & build relationships**

Giving your SDRs a list of 100 leads a day and asking them to cold call does
not work anymore. SDR/BDR need to build relationships and therefore need to
understand the needs & pains of the ICP.

6️⃣ **Demos**

**→ ❌ presentation**

**→ ✅ 2-way interaction**

Good powerful sales product demos engage the prospect. Always come back to
their pain points and tell a compelling story. Check out the [Ultimate Guide
for Sales Demos](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/the-ultimate-
guide-to-sales-product-demos) to close more demos.

7️⃣ **Content Marketing**

**→ ❌ Post daily on Linkedin**

**→ ✅ create valuable content for ICP**

Consistency is obviously important. But only once you know what’s valuable for
your target audience. Having one valuable lead magnet can be more powerful
than [100s of bad content](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-ultimate-content-
marketing-guide).

8️⃣ **Ideal Customer Profile**

**→ ❌ List of accounts**

**→ ✅ Firmographics + Personas**

An ICP is not a list of accounts. A [powerful
ICP](https://startupbusinesstips.substack.com/p/how-to-create-a-powerful-
ideal-customer) has 2 key elements, the firmographics and the persona(s) with
attributes like job title, responsibilities, current tech stack, pain points,
and more.

9️⃣**Sales Motion**

**→ ❌ We do PLG, SLG, and Hybrid**

**→ ✅ Optimize for 1 sales motion**

Stop doing multiple sales motions at a time. Each sales motion works
differently and needs a lot of resources. Focus on one ICP and one dominant
sales motion.

**🔟 Sales Messaging**

**→ ❌ Features 1, 2,3**

**→ ✅ We help ICP to go from A to B and achieve result**

From a strictly logical perspective, SaaS companies looking for growth only
have 3 options:

  1. Acquire New Customers

  2. Upsell Current Customers

  3. Increase Customer Retention

Most companies have pretty strong user acquisition strategies and they’re
often well aware of how to upsell current customers. However, one thing they
tend to disregard is increasing retention. I believe this happens for one main
reason: **it’s not** _**too**_**relevant** **when starting out**. If you have
zero customers, better retention will not matter. But at some point it does.
And when that happens, one thing is particularly important: **understanding
churn**.

**Collecting Churn Feedback**

> “If you are allowing customers to cancel accounts without providing a
> cancellation reason, you’re missing out on invaluable insights.”

SaaS companies need to collect churn feedback - and even offer churned users
something in exchange for sharing their experience with you.

Ask your churning users these 5 questions:

🔸 What made you look for a solution to your problem?

🔸 Where / How did you find us?

🔸 Why did you initially sign up for the tool?

🔸 How did you understand it was not the right tool for you?

🔸 How are you solving the problem now?

These conversations provide important qualitative feedback. You can have deep,
meaningful insights into the experience of a few users. Yet, most churned
users are likely to pass on the offer. That’s why it’s important to ensure you
collect churn feedback from all canceling users, even if it’s in the form of a
simple exit survey.

The data from exit surveys allows you to group the responses into categories
(roughly product features), sort them by ARR, and inform the product roadmap.
As you build these features, churn feedback changes to the next most relevant
functionality.
