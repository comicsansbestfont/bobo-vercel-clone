Arguably there are two types of brand in this world:

**Those you could put on a hat, and those you couldn’t.**

Harley Davidson, Mountain Dew, Jack Daniels, Levis, Marlboro, Fender, Porsche;
all “hattable” brands. Dell, Audi, Dove, Pepsi, Cadbury’s, FedEx; all great
brands, yes, but not “hattable”.

To be the sort of brand who an ordinary person might emblazon on their
clothing, or even tattoo to their body, is both extraordinarily valuable and
extraordinarily difficult. At first glance it’s hard to distil just what it is
that makes a brand worthy of this rare honour.

Clearly, as we discussed in my recent post [the toilet paper
rule](https://basicarts.org/the-toilet-paper-rule/), the nature of the
industry the brand occupies has a lot to do with it. Referring to the list
above, it’s clearly easier to pull this off if you make motorcycles than if
you make shampoo. However that being said, it’s not like a sexy category
guarantees a hattable brand. Jack Daniels may pull it off, but I don’t see
many people rocking Famous Grouse or Glenfiddich merch as a fashion statement.

No, hattable brands do a different job which is in fact distinct from their
core category job, and that is this:

**They are symbols of an archetype or ideology.**

If you think about the word “iconic” for a moment, you can see that what it
literally means is that something (say a person) acts as a _representative
symbol_ (icon) for something else – e.g. Marilyn Monroe is an icon of
femininity and glamour; Charles Manson is an icon of evil and insanity; Kurt
Kobain is an icon of teenage angst; etc.

In certain instances, this same magic can become attached to a brand, whereby
it comes to symbolise a certain idea separate from what the brand is. A Harley
cap doesn’t necessarily say “I like motorcycles”. Instead, it says something
akin to “I’m a rebel”. A Google cap doesn’t say “I like search engines”.
Instead, it says something like “I’m smart”. In these cases, the brands are
performing a sort of “double duty” – not only doing the usual job of
communicating the propositions of their companies, but also acting as sort of
free-floating “ideals”, which would persist even if the company in question
went out of business.

I am sceptical to what extent you can deliberately create a brand like this;
iconography is formed in the cultural hive mind, not engineered by some
marketing department. However, that being said the trend that often links such
brands is a willingness to be co-opted by a group of people that stand against
prevailing norms.

Just as we have discussed at length how important it is for businesses to
strategically cut against _category_ norms, here we are talking about
businesses that cut against _social_ norms – two techniques that can have
similarly powerful effects in different arenas.

It goes without saying that all brands attempt to embody _some sort of ideal_
– to be “aspirational”. However, if you attempt to embody an ideal that is too
broad or orthodox then nobody will feel sufficiently motivated to claim it as
a personal emblem. Signalling with iconography is generally an act of
_defiance_ , and thus demands a certain degree of antagonism. Note that for
the most part the brands we’re talking about here have enemies. Or rather, the
people associated with them do. It’s unquestionable that one of the most
“iconic” and literally hattable brands of the past 20 years is MAGA – Make
America Great Again – which pretty much says it all.

Assuming that a brand successfully manages to tap into a counter-current like
this, the next step on the road to iconography would have to be real-world
adoption by genuine exemplars of the archetype in question. The most obvious
example of this is of course the incredible loyalty that various generations
of rock stars have felt towards Jack Daniels – surely the greatest organic
cultural association in business history.
