It’s hard growing your business.  
It’s hard coming up with creative ideas.  
It’s hard to get a breakthrough.  
It’s hard to really make things change

…or at least, that’s what we tell ourselves. But what if it wasn’t true?

What if all this stuff was actually pretty easy? What if the real reason it
feels hard isn’t because it _is_ hard, but rather is because _we never
actually really even think about it_?

This is an insane proposition, but hear me out. I am telling you that
effective strategic moves and creative ideas are actually right at your
fingertips, but the only reason you don’t see them is because you don’t even
_try_ to. You simply don’t set your mind to the task. You don’t even ask the
question.

Let me prove this to you with a little exercise I heard the other day that can
help you grow easily by 33% – The 10/10/10 Plan.

It goes like this. Just come up with three little ideas:

  * One to get 10% more customers
  * One to charge 10% more per customer
  * One to increase repurchase frequency by 10%

Compounded together these changes would result in 33% growth, but that’s not
the interesting point. The point here is how _easy_ it is to come up with such
ideas.

For example off the top of my head, if I wanted to charge 10% more per
consultancy customer, I could:

  * Add in a rudimentary research service
  * Add in a step where I creatively communicate the strategy with some design bells and whistles
  * Create a premium option where we do some of the work at an exotic off-site location
  * Offer a 6 / 12 / 18 month follow up service
  * Etc etc.

This was like 12 seconds work. It was easy! And yet do I actually think like
this and do these things? Of course not! Because I’m bloody lazy, distracted,
and don’t truly give attention to growing my business.

**Just like you.**

The reason I think we don’t seriously engage in this process is because we
aren’t in the _habit_ of doing so. Our brains are like mush. They’re directed
downwards, at our daily administrative concerns, and they lack the necessary
space and sparks to actually truly engage with this secretly rather easy
stuff.

Sometimes we might try a bit. We might ask ourselves something vague and
impotent like “how can I grow this business?”, or “what should my strategy
be?”. But these are poor questions, as evidenced by how hard they are to
answer.

But when you ask the _right_ questions – like the ones in The 10/10/10 Plan –
you’ll find they’re easy to answer, and in fact the creative potential of your
brain has been lying dormant simply through lack of adequate stimulus.

If I had to take a stab at what the necessary components are to release this
potential, I’d say something like:

  * Time and space away from the running of the business
  * An enthusiastic sparring partner
  * The right questions
  * …and someone great at execution to feed your thoughts to, so they don’t wither on the vine

That would probably do it. But how often do any of us pull together such
components? Not just rarely, but never. _We never do it_.

And when we realise that brutal truth, how can we possibly complain that our
business doesn’t grow? How can we claim that we are doing all we can? We
aren’t even taking the first step!

So what I want you to take away from this piece is not The 10/10/10 Plan, or
any specific direction like that (though you might enjoy it). What I want you
to take away is just how little you are _actually_ seriously working on
growth. How despite what you claim, if we judge by your actions it is probably
your _bottom_ priority, not your top!

And if you think this is somewhat true… well, it’s not gonna take much to
change it.
