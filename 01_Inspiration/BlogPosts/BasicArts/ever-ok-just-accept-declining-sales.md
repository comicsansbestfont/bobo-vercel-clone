OK, this is a weird one I know. However it seems pertinent in light of recent
news that Coke are making “[massive
changes](http://uk.businessinsider.com/coca-cola-revamps-diet-
coke-2018-1?r=US&IR=T)” to their Diet Coke range following a 1.9% sales drop
in 2016.

On the face of it taking action makes complete sense. In the world of Coke,
1.9% of annual sales is an awful lot of cans, and you can’t just let such
revenue slip away without putting up a fight.

Right?

I’m not so sure. The reason for the decline in Diet Coke sales lies not so
much in any failings on their part, as it does in the shifting cultural ground
beneath their feet. Basically perceptions of what’s “healthy” have changed,
and unfortunately for them aspartame hasn’t made the cut. The result of this,
inevitably, as been a migration by a lot of their “health users” away from the
product, and onto something a touch more natural.

They’re hardly the first brand to suffer such an erosion. Spare a thought for
all the poor asbestos manufacturers out there, who surely thought the good
times would never end, until, despite their continued manufacturing
excellence, they did.

Yes, sadly sometimes a product simply has had its time. You exist in a wider
context, and if that context turns against you, well, that’s just bad luck.

Such a fact of life is something we surely can all understand. However that
doesn’t mean we know how to respond when it happens to us. Coke’s reaction?
Fight back. They’re bringing out the big guns with new packaging for Diet
Coke, a range of new flavours under the banner, and a nice new ad campaign.

Do any of these things negate the way the tide has turned against them? Not in
the slightest. And, for this reason, whilst they may achieve a sales spike
from the novelty of their play, they will surely fail to arrest the brand’s
continued decline in the long term.

Of course, they could have gone more radical and actually tinkered with the
core product to try and respond to changing consumer tastes. But then Coke, of
all brands, knows better than to make such a dumb move as that – because even
with a sales dip this is still an extraordinarily successful product, with
millions of resolutely loyal fans who will continue to lap it up until the day
they die.

Therefore, considering they’re damned if they do and damned if they don’t,
wouldn’t it be OK to just… let Diet Coke shrink a bit?

I’m not arguing that one should let a brand simply go to seed. Smart
management of the decline could have massive financial implications, so the
Diet Coke team can hardly switch to auto-pilot just yet. I’m simply saying
that, sometimes, fighting back against a cultural shift that is entirely out
of your hands is throwing good money after bad. A sales decline is not
necessarily somebody’s “fault”, it’s just part of the natural lifecycle of a
product.

Maybe I’m being unfair on Coke here. There’s a lot I don’t know, and perhaps
their plan for the brand is a really smart play. I simply use them to make the
point – like it or not products come, and products go. Smart brands know when
to let a product gently drift away, and have a clear strategy that enables
them to seamlessly introduce something new in its place, continually
reinventing themselves whilst remaining thematically consistent. If you’re
completely married to a specific product however, a _specific sku_ , then you
are at the mercy of fortune, and eventually the world will move on without
you.

So a sales decline? Not always such a bad thing. But good luck telling the
shareholders…
