Thanks to the new Netflix drama _The Queen’s Gambit_ (and the fact that new TV
shows are starting to slow to a bit of a trickle), there’s been a lot of
interest in chess recently.

Now in general I think chess analogies map quite poorly onto business – as do
those of military and sport. People love to envision business as a zero-sum
battle, but in reality it isn’t like that. The market is not like a board, a
playing field, or a battle ground; it is open, rather than closed, and thus
more accurately mirrors an _ecosystem_ than a competition.

Nevertheless there is one chess scenario, which I _do_ think has a business
parallel, and can be devastatingly effective for those who master it. _The
pin_.

In chess an opponent’s piece is pinned when they cannot move it without
exposing a more valuable piece to attack. In other words they are paralysed:
they can see what they want to do, but your manoeuvres have left them unable
to act without incurring severe damage.

In business, the pin occurs when you make a strategic play in the market which
your competitor _wants_ to copy, but can’t – because if they were to do so it
would _undermine their current position_. This presents them with a catch-22:
either sit still and allow you to enjoy uncontested market space, and all the
rewards that come with it; or follow you, adjust their brand positioning, and
in doing so jeopardise everything they have.

Needless to say most will simply leave you to it.

Clearly then, a successfully orchestrated pin is pretty desirable. The
question is how we do it. How can we possibly uncover a strategic brand
positioning which is both effective, but also uncopyable?

The answer lies in the concept of _contrarian value_.

We all understand, I hope, the benefits of bringing _new value_ to the market.
That’s pretty self explanatory. Give people something new, which only you
offer, and the rewards will flow like water. The problem with new value
however is that it generally doesn’t remain new for long – if it’s effective,
the competition will come piling in. _Contrarian value_ on the other hand is a
little bit different, in that not only is it new, but it is new in a manner
which _disagrees with the conventions of the category_.

Businesses who offer contrarian value take a metric which everyone in their
category agrees is important, and decide to attack it – not only by failing to
offer it, but by questioning its very validity. They effectively become
walking rebukes of their own industry – and in doing so also enable themselves
to offer new value which is directly opposed to the one they reject.

We can see contrarian value at play again and again when we analyse the great
strategic successes of business history:

  *     * Nintendo attacked the value of ever greater performance in the console wars, creating a deliberately underpowered console (the Switch) which was then able to be made portable due to its smaller size
    * Dyson destroyed the accepted price limit that people would be prepared to pay for dull appliances like vacuum cleaners, and thus were able to introduce the concept of luxury into the market (a similar strategy to that of Tesla, who decide to frame electric cars as luxury performance vehicles, rather than economical runabouts as had been customary before)
    * The Savannah Bananas, a minor league baseball team, _decided to stop investing in playing performance_ , and to instead focus resources on the fan experience (which ironically resulted in such hugely improved revenues that they ended up being able to improve the team as well)

Sometimes contrarian value can be found in the most superficial, and seemingly
silly of ideas. For instance the fast growing canned water brand Liquid Death
do nothing special at all, other than rejecting the universal convention of
water brands presenting as clean, pure, and wholesome. This enables them to
embody an utterly distinctive “heavy metal” aesthetic which no other water
brand could dream of copying.

Ultimately it doesn’t matter what you question, _just so long as it’s
something central to the brand positioning of your competitors_ – since this
is what will make them unable to follow. No business is going to willingly gut
itself of one of its key strengths, and so this is what makes what makes
contrarian value strategies so defensively strong.

That then is how you engineer a business pin.

Still, strong as such strategies are, they are also rare. Understandably so.
It takes a lot of bravery to neglect something which common sense suggests is
a crucial part of your brand’s offering. To many, it will come across as
suicidal.

But, as with anything, it is this high barrier to entry that makes the rewards
so large.

If you want to develop a strategy like this, but do so in the most de-risked
way possible, then Basic Arts can help. We specialise in uncovering the
contrarian value which your business is already offering (generally not
deliberately), and helping you lean into it purposefully so it drives a
powerful wedge between you and the rest of your category.
