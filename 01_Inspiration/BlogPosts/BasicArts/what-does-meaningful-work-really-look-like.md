The other day I saw a great couple of tweets from a user called Madeon, which
I repeat here in full:

  * “I think it’s a tired idea to pretend every piece of art is ‘telling a story’ or ‘spreading a message’ like those are the only valid reasons to create”
  * “Can you imagine watching a sunset and being like ‘but what’s the STORY tho, what’s the MESSAGE’”

I love this, as I think he’s touched on a much bigger issue here, a thoroughly
modern disease I’m going to summarise as:

**Overvaluing output, undervaluing process.**

To first explain this in the field his tweets are referring to, it’s plain to
see a marked trend in judging art based on the “importance” of the “message”
it spreads, rather than  _the intrinsic qualities of the thing itself_. To
give a blunt example, an artwork which is simply yoghurt spread all over a
wall to represent, say, the plight of immigrants might be heralded as “great
art” by the critics, whilst an exquisitely beautiful painting of a flower,
that exists only for its own sake, will be dismissed as trite and meaningless.
The “output” is the important thing, not the thing itself.

One place you see this trend particularly vividly is on the movie review
platform Rotten Tomatoes, where movies frequently get “ratioed”, meaning they
receive a very high average rating from critics (say 94%), and a very low
average rating from the public (say 22%). This phenomenon is driven in part by
the critics being far more focused on the message of a movie than its
intrinsic qualities, whilst the public are generally skewed in the opposite
direction, hence the disconnect.

Overall I think it’s fair to say that we live in a climate where we’re told
that for a piece of art to be worthwhile it must be doing a “job” outside of
itself – and that all art which doesn’t strive for this is wasting our time.
There is an increasing lack of value placed on doing something simply because
it’s joyful, beautiful, passionate, or any other similar worth which exists
within the thing itself.

**What’s interesting here is the way that this belief pervades not only art,
but other fields too – most notably for our purposes, the field of work.**

As you’ll have gathered there is a great deal of desire among people today to
find fulfilling or “purposeful” work, and not without good reason. After all,
our work is the thing we spend most of time doing, and whilst there’s an
undeniable dignity to grinding through a hated job in order to put food on the
table, it’s clearly not the ideal situation.

The issue however comes in what people think fulfilling work actually is.

Ask someone today and the typical answer they’ll give is one focused on the
_output_ of the job – in other words whether the organisation they work for
does something “important” or for the social good. By this logic it is
fulfilling to work for a charity, the healthcare services, a human rights law
firm, or for an uber-purposeful brand, but it is  _not_ fulfilling to work for
a marketing agency, widget manufacturer, or cigarette brand.

As you can see this is the same logic as employed with art: the focus is on
whether the  _second order effect_ of the work is good or not. What you are
actually doing (the process) isn’t as important as who you’re doing it for
(the output).

As a result of this, people now tend to place a disproportionate emphasis on
the place they work, rather than what they actually  _do_ for their work
moment to moment. Exaggerating the point slightly, the assumption seems to be
that  _any_ job at the UN would be preferable to  _any_ job at the local paper
merchant. “I don’t care what I do, but I do care where I do it”.

Now just as there is validity in judging a work of art by the message, so too
is there validity in judging a job by its output. I have no doubt that many
people do indeed find fulfilment by knowing that their company does something
they believe in. However I do not believe this is the only way of finding
fulfilment – nor the most effective.

I’d venture that most people would find more profound (and accessible)
fulfilment by focussing on the process of what they do, regardless of the
output they’re producing. The output of most jobs is reality a “Macguffin” – a
Hollywood term for a plot device that’s there to give a framework for a movie,
but isn’t really what the movie is actually about.

To illustrate this idea, imagine a master carpenter who builds beautiful
handmade chairs. Most people would imagine this to be quite a fulfilling
career, but why? Does he wake up excited every morning because, thanks to him,
people are able to sit down? (i.e. output fulfilment) Pretty doubtful – most
likely he couldn’t care less about what it is the chairs do, they’re just
chairs. What he cares about instead is the fulfilment he gets from the
_process_ of making them. The output is simply a “device” to give him an
excuse to engage in the passion of his craft.

Another slightly more everyday example was once found in the advertising
industry. In terms of output, most people would agree that there are few
fields more trivial than advertising. However that didn’t stop it being a
desirable profession, since in terms of  _process_ , there are few fields more
rewarding. Advertising contains within in such intrinsically joyful elements
as:

  * Relationship building
  * Learning about new things
  * Insight generation
  * Coming up with ideas
  * Artistic craft
  * Variable outcomes (i.e. a sense of being a “game”)

…to name but a few.

However today, because of the gradual shift to output focus, advertising has
lost this aura. New graduates are less attracted to it than the were in the
past because it’s “trivial”. And what is more, in a desperate and misguided
attempt to inject meaning into the field, agencies have increasingly attempted
to focus on doing “purposeful work” (i.e. altruistic output work), which
ironically has actually  _stripped_ meaning from the process, as it’s
smothered creativity.

Sort of proves the point I think.

**The bottom line here is this: unless you have an unusual passion for a very
particular output, you are much more likely to find meaning in the process of
your work than in the results of it.**

If you’re an accountant at a lightbulb factory you’re unlikely to magically
find fulfilment by switching jobs and going to be an accountant at an NGO. The
_real_ question is whether you enjoy accountancy in the first place, and
whether the conditions of job allow you to practice it in a way which gives
you satisfaction.

Unfortunately there’s a bit of a catch here of course, and it’s this: in order
to know what kind of process truly fulfils you, you need to understand
yourself very deeply. Far more than most of us do. This is in part why I wrote
my [last piece](https://us16.campaign-
archive.com/?u=dbfcfcd097fd0818275a2b8b8&id=5620716fe7).

Most of us never find career fulfilment because don’t know ourselves, and
therefore we seek it  _extrinsically_ , jumping to more attractive companies
and more attractive pay packets (another form of output-focus), but all the
while engaging in a process that doesn’t suit us. Where we should be seeking
it is  _intrinsically_ ; inside ourselves, and within the actions that make up
our day-to-day.

So let us ask, what is the  _behaviour_ , the  _ritual_ , the  _thought type_
, the  _way of being_ , in which you’re really able to lose yourself and enter
a flow state? What feels like play to you, but wouldn’t to most people? What
is something, no matter how trivial, that you feel you can do to the level of
an  _art_?

Because that should be the fabric of your work life. The rest of it (usually)
is vanity.
