Yup, this surprised me too.

Following “the PR disaster to end all PR disasters” that occurred when
[footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrDWY6C1178) was released of United
Airlines forcibly removing David Dao from one of their flights due to
overbooking, one might have thought that the carrier would receive some sort
of retribution for their sins.

I mean, all sorts of dirt was being flung at the business, with people
speculating that their randomised choice might have been racially motivated,
that Dao had incurred brain damage, etc. etc., whilst 6.8 million people
watched the spectacle on YouTube in a single day. Even the president weighed
in (OK, not an altogether uncommon occurrence these days, but still).

And yet it appears that the effect this scandal had on the bottom line was
approximately zero. United went on to post record results in their next
quarter, including increased sales. Basically, when push came to shove, nobody
really cared.

So what’s going on here? It’s not like PR simply doesn’t matter – there have
been many businesses in the past that have been derailed by similar criticism,
so why did United get away with it?

To me the reason seems to be this: by behaving in this way, United actually
did nothing to undermine their core offering as a company.

United have become, by and by, a low-end carrier. The public now expect poor
facilities, poor service, overbooking, and all sorts of other compromises in
exchange for good prices, manifold routes, and reliability – all boxes that
United tick pretty well. Therefore, when they dragged Dao kicking and
screaming from their aircraft, they ironically weren’t really doing anything
to contradict that. “Yup, that’s the risk you take flying with United” came
the quip, as the ticket sales kept rolling in.

In fact, in an obtuse way, you could almost argue they *enhanced* their image,
if you were to consider that this has somehow intensified their grisly,
workman-like image. This isn’t to say of course that people now want to fly
United _more_ following the incident – it’s just that they broke no promises,
kinda fulfilled expectations, and thus now occupy that space in people’s minds
even more fully than they did before.

This incident proves the paramount importance of **_coherence_** for
businesses in the internet age. It doesn’t matter whether you’re “good” or
“bad” so much as it matters that you are **_something in particular_** , and
that this something can be read and easily understood by the market at large.
You develop this image not by the messages you pump out in your marketing
(though of course they’ll contribute), but by behaving in a distinctive way
consistently over a long period of time.

United, whilst they may not be “good”, _have_ been consistent and distinctive.
Basically they’ve carved out a niche as the “bad airline”, and, because there
is a place for that type of brand in the market, it’s served them very well. A
similar thing happened with Ryanair in Europe back in their heyday, where they
almost seemed to revel in “bad” PR, so long as it was consistent with their
market positioning.

The trouble for United is that, unlike Ryanair, they probably didn’t do this
on purpose. Their tagline after all is “fly the friendly skies”, which is
sadly the precise _opposite_ of the image they have cultivated in reality.
Luckily for them, nobody pays attention to that kind of trite sloganeering
anymore, so it doesn’t get in the way of the _real_ brand that is being built
daily in the minds of the media and consumers as a result of their actions.
Indeed its redundancy speaks volumes about the weakness of traditional
marketing today in the face of independent media.

Still, whilst it’s worked out pretty well for United, most businesses will
want to actually plan these things, and that means taking the position you
want to own in the market (your “friendly skies” say), and dragging that out
of your ads and into your real business operations.

But if you just go with the flow you won’t end up like United – bad but
remarkable – you’ll probably just be unremarkable full stop – which is much
much worse.
