When you break up with someone, have you ever noticed something weird?

The next person you get together with – mysteriously – somehow ends up being
the exact _opposite_ of the person you broke up with.

Funny that.

It’s almost like us humans have a tendency to _over-correct_ when things go
wrong. And to _over-value_ the most recent piece of data we’ve been exposed
to.

Now this might be a good evolutionary strategy.

But it’s not a good _business_ strategy.

Especially when things go wrong.

You see whenever we suffer a setback with our business, we naturally tend to
direct our energies and focus (i.e. “strategy”) in _response_ to that setback.
Imagine for example:

  * You lose your biggest client
  * You lose your most valuable employee
  * You get a bad review online

…or even frankly some randomer says something unkind about your business in
passing.

“Oh shit!”, we think, “we’ve gotta stop something like this from happening
again!”.

We’re instantly distracted, and we immediately set about “fixing” the causes,
little realising that this repair-job is sending us down a strategic path
which may be completely irrelevant or ineffective.

**Maybe** you biggest client has had an internal shake up.

**Maybe** your most valuable employee just wants a career change.

**Maybe** the bad review was a total one-off.

The point is that if you respond to every setback, this will amount to a
random shift in strategy every few months, and you’ll never really get
traction with one thing or another.

**This is why a clear strategy is so important for recovering from setbacks.**

Reactive flip-flopping can only occur in a vacuum, where there is no strategy
to hold onto. But when you actually know _what you’re fo_ r, _what bet you’re
making_ , and _where you are going_ , you can contextualise these setbacks,
and shrug them off.

One of the guys in [The Strategy Shortcut
System](http://www.strategyshortcutsystem.com) shared the other day that his
first employee had recently quit, and it had really shaken him up. But he
_also_ said that thanks to his new strategic focus, he wasn’t going to
overreact to it. He was able to steady himself and get back to the game.

That is an underrated thing a clear strategy gives you.

**A still centre.**

Something to return to – almost like a mantra – in times of turbulence.

Of course now and again a setback might occur directly _because_ of a
strategy. And in such cases you might want to adapt. But honestly, this is
super unusual. Most problems you’ll face aren’t strategic at all. They’re just
like weather. Shit happens, and tomorrow the sun will be out again

Do not over-react.

Do not over-correct.

Do not over-think.

Do not over-emphasise.

You know what your game is. Return to it. Keep pushing.

And before you blink, it’ll all be forgotten.
