_Two households, both alike in dignity,_

_In fair Verona, where we lay our scene_

**Romeo & Juliet**  

Human beings are copying machines.

This is the central idea of “mimetic theory”, which was put forward by
historian René Girard to explain the motivations of human beings, the
evolution of culture, and ultimately the rise of war. As he put it:

“Man is the creature who does not know what to desire, and he turns to others
in order to make up his mind. We desire what others desire because we imitate
their desires.”

On the surface this might seem a bit facile, and not especially insightful. Is
it not simply an articulation of what we might now call “fashion”, or even
“keeping up with the Joneses”? To a degree it is, however when you think about
it more deeply you discover that it is a more powerful and meaningful force
than any such terms suggest.

**Simply put, if we are all copying each other (and we are), then we will
gradually converge until we collide; as we all reach for the same status,
possessions, space, customers, and whatever else everyone desires.**

To give you one basic example of this, I shared a link in my [Christmas
newsletter](https://us16.campaign-
archive.com/?u=dbfcfcd097fd0818275a2b8b8&id=4d63a12c6e) to a short explanation
of the theory of “[elite
overproduction](http://peterturchin.com/cliodynamica/intra-elite-competition-
a-key-concept-for-understanding-the-dynamics-of-complex-societies/)”. This
idea states that societies eventually reach a point where you get more people
vying for the same high status positions than there are available vacancies.
In other words, you get a surplus of “elites”. In the United States this is
currently manifesting through more people _getting_ degrees than there are
jobs _requiring_ degrees, leading to incredibly intense competition for
“mimetic careers” that everyone wants such as those in finance, law, and
consulting. The consequence naturally is many overeducated and underemployed
people who are unsurprisingly pissed off.

If people were truly “following their own path” then such a thing wouldn’t
happen; people would have a wide variety of different ambitions. However, due
to our mimetic behaviour, everyone ends up following each others’ paths,
ultimately ending in conflict.

Conflict is the key idea here, because contrary to the assumption that it is
those who are very different who clash, it is actually those who are
_extremely similar_ who end up colliding.

This is why the feud between the Montagues and the Capulets in Romeo and
Juliet emerged; not because they were chalk and cheese, but because they were
“two households both alike in dignity”. This is also the root of sectarian
violence. This is why Christopher Hitchens observed: “in numerous cases of
apparently ethno-nationalist conflict, the deepest hatreds are manifested
between people who—to most outward appearances—exhibit very few significant
distinctions.” In short, this is the root of Freud’s “narcissism of small
differences”.

If there were _no differences_ , then there would be no conflict: you’d be on
the same team (or in the case of job competition, you’d be the same person!).
But if there are small differences, then parties must compete over who gets to
define and occupy the subject of mimetic desire:

**“There can only be one of this thing, and that’s going to be us!”**

Business, naturally, is just as mimetic as anything else. A couple of months
back I wrote about this in my piece concerning why founders fail to [build
distinctive brands](https://basicarts.org/why-are-startup-brands-so-boring/) –
boring startup brands who all look alike. The very fact that blands exist is
purely down to mimetic behaviour. More cynically engineered corporate brands,
by elevating market analysis over taste, often protect themselves from falling
into the mimetic trap – thus leaving the most egregious forms of mimicry in
the hands of startups. This is especially true of tech / DTC startups, which
of course should come as no surprise, since making a tech or DTC startup has
become a mimetic trend in and of itself.

This is why the idea of _avoiding competition_ is always central to my advice.
It is a way to diminish the lure of mimesis, so you can put yourself into a
scenario where you aren’t in bloody combat with other brands who wish to
occupy the same space. By encouraging difference, you encourage harmony; like
different notes combining to produce a chord.

It’s a bizarre way to think about it, I admit, but in a manner of speaking all
business competition is a form of “sectarianism”. In each case you have two
(or three, or four, or five…) versions of the same thing, each with trivial
differences, each wishing to represent the final version of “that” thing. Just
as with other forms of sectarianism, this battle comes at a heavy cost to its
participants – and to an outside party (such as a consumer), appears
completely pointless because hey, they’re basically the same aren’t they?

Rejecting competition then, is essentially a “mental shortcut” to diffuse this
process, which you would otherwise fall into automatically, without even
thinking about it. I myself am in no way immune. When I did a bit of
“rebranding” on Basic Arts last year, I hired a designer who I’d worked with
on a client project, and in the end ultimately picked a route which looked
very similar to what he’d done for them. I only realised this after the fact,
and was quite shocked by it – however fortunately given that the client in
question was an alcohol brand I’m not in danger of too much crossover! Indeed
one could argue that copying something which is utterly different from
yourself can actually produce an original outcome.

Elsewhere, there are other shortcuts you can use to avoid the trap in various
different fields.

A famous one in the area of hiring was popularised by Peter Thiel – who is
himself a passionate acolyte (and former student) of Girard, and a leading
advocate of rejecting competition. In his case, he wished to avoid hiring
people who were particularly susceptible to mimetic desire, and as a result
always asked the interview question: “what important question do very few
people agree with you on?”.

As he explains:

“This question sounds easy because it’s straightforward. Actually, it’s very
hard to answer. It’s intellectually difficult because the knowledge that
everyone is taught in school is by definition agreed upon. And it’s
psychologically difficult because anyone trying to answer must say something
she knows to be unpopular. Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even
shorter supply than genius.”

Almost everybody in that situation would give an answer which is in fact
highly agreeable – and thus would out themselves as someone “mimetically
vulnerable”, and so not an ideal hire. I mean, can you imagine throwing out a
_genuinely_ unpopular opinion in a job interview? Most people can’t.

Another shortcut, on the more macro level, is to simply consume a different
media diet than everyone else. If you exclusively read the New York Times,
watch Netflix, and read the latest bestsellers, then it’s going to be very
tricky to resist mimesis. However if you largely read, say, books that are
over 50 years old (one for all the Lindy fans out there), then you will not
only be knowledgable; you will be _divergently knowledgable_ – which confers
not only competitive advantage, but also, paradoxically, social harmony.

Anyway, these are just a few examples. Sufficed to say we all copy _far more_
than we think we do; and far from making our lives easier, it often makes them
harder.

Keep in mind that strategic thinking is rooted in finding the gaps between the
mimicry – and so demands resistance to that powerful desire.
