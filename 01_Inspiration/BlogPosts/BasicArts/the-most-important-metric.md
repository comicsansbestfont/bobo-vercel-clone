When I was around 15, me and a pal went to see the movie _Collateral_ ,
starring Tom Cruise. In it Cruise played a colder-than-ice assassin on the
streets of a neo-noir Los Angeles.

Sufficed to say we were pretty impressed. So much so in fact that my friend
briefly experimented with modelling his personal style on the character.

Now on paper, this seems pretty rational. Cruise was undeniably pretty cool in
the movie, and therefore, logically, becoming more like him would make my
friend cooler too, no? Sadly things don’t quite work that way. What fits for a
40-year-old movie star in a fictionalised LA doesn’t necessarily fit for a
schoolboy in Ipswich – and so perversely the short-lived imitation had the
unintended consequence of _lowering_ my friend’s cool, not enhancing it.

This anecdote reveals a principle that I think has massive applicability in
all sorts of fields; a principle I would summarise something like this:

_It doesn’t matter what you are. What matters is *how much* you are what you
are._

This applies to people. It applies to novels. It applies to cars. It applies
to architecture. And, of course, it applies to businesses.

To put the same idea another way, just so it’s easy to get your head around:
it’s better to embody an undesirable ideal 100%, than a desirable one 50%. The
issue for my friend wasn’t that he was trying to mimic something not worth
mimicking. It’s that he was aspiring to an image that it was impossible for
someone in his position to ever embody _completely_ – thus resulting in an
incongruent final “product” that comes across as disingenuous and try-hard.

Extremely uncool, in other words.

This is probably why teenagers – for the most part – are regularly so awkward.
They are at a point in their life where they are experimenting with different
images, trying on different faces, and thus are unlikely to ever be fully
themselves; to be a “coherent whole”.

As you grow up you start to see the truth – that “coolness” is not defined by
a _particular_ style, but by fully embodying _any_ style. Jonny Knoxville,
Steven Hawking, and Mother Theresa represent wildly differing archetypes, but
they are all aspirational figures. Why? Not because their archetypes are
necessarily desirable, but because they are them _completely_. They know what
they are, and they lean into it – thus becoming charismatic and, in their own
ways, irresistible.

This is what people mean when they say there’s nothing more attractive than
“being yourself” – it’s just that _very_ few people have the courage to ever
be themselves so completely as to realise this potential. We mostly allow our
personas to be polluted by aspirations that don’t truly suit us.

Think of yourself, perhaps. You, like anyone, have a natural tendency towards
a particular persona – and if you committed to it you’d be _awesome_. But
also, like anyone, you are probably seduced by certain other personas
(probably embodied by public figures you admire) which you allow to pull you
in other directions, thus “hedging” your true self.

This is all completely normal of course. Almost impossible to resist, even.
But it’s the gap between us mere mortals and those considered to be icons.

Naturally, this identical process happens in business.

Great companies are those with the courage to lean into their unconventional
or supposedly “unappealing” natural business archetypes.

Ryanair, for example, completely embodies its archetype of “low fares at all
costs”. It doesn’t pretend to be anything else, and is fully prepared to
embrace both the good and that bad of that position. This is why when
supposedly “negative” headlines about them arise (such as charging people to
use the bathroom in-flight), they result in _positive_ business results. They
serve to deepen their embodiment of their business archetype, and thus
strengthen their position – just as how a headline about Jonny Knoxville being
arrested for lewd behaviour would strengthen his (but wouldn’t have
strengthened Steven Hawking’s).

Ironically the closest thing that Ryanair could get to genuinely negative
press would be something suggesting they plan to make their service more
pleasant and premium. That supposedly “positive” headline would be incongruent
with their image, and thus produce a net negative.

Sadly Ryanair are an extremely unusual case, in being comfortable with owning
an unconventional position.

Just like with people, most companies would rather be a shit version of
something they admire, than the brilliant version of what they are.

How many pseudo-Apples, pseudo-Nikes, pseudo-Patagonias, pseudo-Googles are
there out there? Every copycat of these businesses makes a fundamental
analysis error: they believe that the thing that makes these companies
successful is _what_ they represent; when the truth is that it’s the
_completeness_ of their representation that counts.

Those brands are great because they are ruthlessly congruent. It’s not that
they are “X”, but that they are “100% X”. When you copy them, you don’t claim
their glory; you simply come across like my friend channeling Cruise, or
Knoxville channeling Hawking. Incomplete.

When you understand this principle you quickly figure out that there is almost
no position, no image, no business archetype, which is undesirable. It’s just
that most haven’t been fully embodied yet. We don’t have “an Apple of X
position”, we only have “an Apple of Y position”, and that’s why Y position
appears so attractive. But it’s an illusion. Any position would be attractive
if only there were someone with the courage to make it their own.

So heed the words of your mother, and then go one step further. Don’t just be
yourself. Own it. Embrace both its positives and its negatives. Because
whatever “it” is doesn’t matter. Only the extent of your commitment, and it’s
fit with your natural self.
