We live under the illusion of control.

We believe that we design our lives, we design our companies, we design
culture, and we design human civilisation itself. The way we do this,
according to the belief, is that we analyse the situation, make a plan, and
then execute it – and in doing so create the reality we desire.

Now for some simple things, this is true. Decorating our living room say, or
building a road from point A to point B. I don’t wish to imply that _nothing_
is deliberately designed. However such designable things represent simple
“closed” systems – where we have sufficient mastery of all the variables as to
narrow the gap between our intentions and the result. But when it comes to
chaotic “open” systems, where there are more variables than we can grasp, and
their relationship is more complex than we can compute, this gap widens – and
we are incapable as a species of controlling their outcomes.

**The examples I listed above – what we might call “the important stuff” – are
precisely such systems.**

As long-time readers will know, I’ve written a lot about this idea when it
comes to businesses. About being prepared for your initial hypothesis to be
wrong, and then “discovering” what you have actually created with your brand
so you can fall into line behind it.

But when you think about this, couldn’t you apply the exact same principle to
– say – your career?

How many of you followed precisely the path you envisaged at the outset? And
if you’ve achieved some success, how much of that was down to a brilliantly
executed plan, and how much was down to isolated serendipitous moments? The
person you met at that event you almost didn’t go to; the book you picked up
on a whim one Tuesday; the tweet you fired off without thinking about it?

Even for those careers that have a pre-ordained “on rails” path, which begins
at university, like medicine, for instance, there are still infinite variables
along the way which have a profound effect on the ultimate outcome.

Our illusion of control in such fields might better be described as a
delusion: one that gives us all sorts of headaches as our best-laid plans fail
to bear fruit, and we rail against the “unfairness” of those “less smart” than
ourselves having opportunities seemingly fall into their laps whilst ours
remain empty.

In this piece then I want to address a technique that enables us to maximise
our chances of success in the face of this chaos. Not a way of choosing our
ideal outcome – which is impossible – but rather of making it more likely that
we arrive somewhere we find agreeable; whether for ourselves, our families,
our businesses, or our communities.

**That technique is the liberal use of _asymmetric bets_.**

The core idea of asymmetric bets is of course pretty simple, and I don’t want
to teach you to suck eggs here. It just means:

_Acts where the potential payoff is massively higher than the cost of the
act._

The investor Naval Ravikant gave some good examples of asymmetric bets on a
personal level (you can imagine business equivalents), which included:

  * Investing in start-ups
  * Starting a business
  * Creating a book, podcast, or video
  * Going on lots of dates
  * Going to a cocktail party
  * Moving to a big city
  * Reading a classic book

Naturally, the cost of these actions varies wildly – investing in a startup
will cost thousands, whilst reading a classic book is effectively free – but
in each case, the potential payback far outweighs the investment you’ve put
in.

So far this is all pretty obvious; but what is not so obvious is the
realisation that the more you “overload” your life with such bets, the more
likely you are to end up somewhere exciting. If you do any one of these things
just once, the overwhelming likelihood is that nothing will come from it, and
you’ll think “well that was a waste of time”. However if you do a wide variety
of such things daily, you will gradually start to see returns as the wins
start to unpredictably trickle through.

Another way of articulating the same idea is to think about it as simply
opening yourself up to opportunity, and giving yourself “optionality”. We’ve
all heard the phrase “you make your own luck”, well that’s basically what this
is. The person who goes to 1,000 cocktail parties will almost certainly
generate more opportunities than the one who goes to 5. They won’t have been
“lucky” however – not really – instead they were just living in a manner that
invited options; options to which they simply need to say “yes” or “no”.

Asymmetric bets then are not so much individual things, but rather a way of
life. A habit and a mindset which bears unexpected fruit – and the opposite of
the more conventional mindset which focuses itself narrowly on the cultivation
of “expected fruit”.

Now it’s important to recognise here that unfortunately, the power of
asymmetric bets doesn’t tend to accrue with different people very unevenly. A
basic example of this is that an extrovert will probably expose themselves to
this more than an introvert. This says absolutely zero about their relative
capabilities of course, but it may lead to an uneven distribution of “luck”.
Consider also the way that successful new businesses arise disproportionally
in certain urban centres. Again, same issue. People in those locations aren’t
having better ideas, and they aren’t more capable. But they will – purely by
virtue of where they live – be placing more bets, and exposing themselves to
more volatility. And that counts for a hell of a lot.

It reminds me somewhat of when I read Malcolm Gladwell’s book many years ago.
In it he demonstrated how the Silicon Valley titans like Bill Gates and Steve
Jobs created their empires not primarily through genius, hard work, or shrewd
planning, but rather through an extraordinary cocktail of circumstances that
made their achievements almost look like manifest destiny. They were born in
exactly the right places, at exactly the right times, and went to exactly the
right schools etc. etc. in order to end up where they did – giving them an
unassailable advantage over pretty much everyone else in the world for those
particular outcomes. This isn’t in any way to say that they weren’t talented
and all the rest of it. It’s one thing to be exposed to the opportunities,
it’s quite another to take them. It’s simply to say that they were the
beneficiaries of chaos – and if you play the game, you can make yourself such
a beneficiary too.

**After all, there will be a particular outcome which you will be usually
well-positioned for. It’s just you won’t know what that is until you achieve
it.**

Sadly the ability to place asymmetric bets has been significantly hampered in
our current restricted living conditions. People seem to think that (in some
cases) they can do their jobs and live perfectly adequately via Zoom, online
deliveries, and so on. And if you believe in design delusion then yes, that
would appear to be true. But in the real world, it isn’t, because we have
essentially stripped all the “pointless complexities” out of life – the stuff
that happens _between the things we intended –_ and thus have completely
blitzed our optionality. This is partly why I’ve always been sympathetic to
the “pointless meetings” people always complain about. Yes, they might be
pointless on the face of it. But every once in a while they’re not – and in a
big way.

Anyway, hopefully soon creative chaos can return. In the meantime it is worth
evaluating how much we are inviting this potential in our current plans. Are
we doing those cheap, and perhaps often “pointless” things?

Or are we “optimising” ourselves out of the reach of fortune?
