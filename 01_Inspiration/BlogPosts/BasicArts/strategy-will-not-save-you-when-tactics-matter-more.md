An unhelpful trait of human beings is to attach certain “moral qualities” to
concepts which are entirely neutral.

The whole “strategy vs. tactics” debate is a good example of this.

Strategy is seen as this noble, highbrow, terribly important thing; practiced
by the true sophisticates.

Tactics on the other hand are seen as being a bit trivial, witless, and
lowbrow. Tinkering around the edges without any meaningful stakes or vision.

I myself have been guilty of this strategy bias.

But of course, it is dumb.

For both strategy and tactics are nothing more than tools – no more morally
loaded than a hammer and screwdriver.

And just like a hammer and screwdriver, they each have their uses; occasions
where one is essential, and the other is near-useless.

Today I want to write about the particular situation where strategy is
useless, and only tactics will save you:

**When your business is in distress.**

This might sound like a weird thing to say, but a failing business should not
be concerning itself with strategic questions.

It should not be thinking long term.

It should not be innovating.

It should not be breaking new ground in the market.

No, expansive progressive moves are a _luxury_ for businesses that have a
solid foundation to build on. And truth be told, bold strategy does not
typically give you that foundation.

You know what does?

**Bread and butter, best-practice tactics.**

To be perfectly clear, when I say tactics, I mean the kinds of tidy,
disciplined, sensible operating practices which will confer _no competitive
advantage_ , but which will make your business operate smoothly.

For example, having a solid follow up game with your sales leads is a
_tactic_. It will not 10x your business, it will not open up white space, it
will not get you featured on the front cover of Forbes.

It requires no imagination, no creative thinking, no risk, no leaps.

But dammit, the difference between _doing it_ and _not doing it_ is huge.

In my experience businesses who are genuinely struggling, losing money, and in
danger of going under, universally have a terrible tactical game.

They are leaving vast amounts of money on the table simply because they’re not
doing the basics right. They don’t know who their customers are. They don’t
know where to find them. They don’t know how to reach them. They have no sales
funnel to pull them through. They haven’t mastered conversions, or upselling.
None of this stuff.

Assuming that what you offer is semi-coherent, a solid tactical game near
_guarantees_ you’ll make money.

And so if you’re not making money?

That’s the place to start.

We can pretty much summarise the idea with this little formula:

**No strategy + no tactics = failing business**  
**No strategy + tactics = functional business**  
**Strategy + tactics = flying business**

_(You might ask, what about a business with great strategy + poor tactics?
These are super unusual because strategy is much harder and rarer than
tactics, but it does happen. I’d sort of put myself in that camp. Such
businesses typically generate a lot of demand but leave lots of money on the
table, and are quite “lumpy”, and so net-out similar to a “functional
business”, albeit with a different vibe)_

In the past when I was approached by distressed businesses, I would preach
strategy as their solution (classic “when you have a hammer every problem
looks like a nail”), and it was pretty ineffective.

Now I’ve learned the error of my ways I don’t do that anymore, and instead
encourage them to pursue short term tactical competence first.

What does this look like?

Well there are thousands of tactics, but big picture this is the stuff I’d be
focusing on as a distressed business.

### 1\. Message clarity

Forget whether what you’re offering is unique or differentiated. Just make
sure it’s clear and understood. Donald Miller’s Storybrand framework is great
for this, as I’ve mentioned before.

### 2\. Identify audience

Be clear on who it’s easiest to sell this thing to, based on how acute their
need is, AND how easy it is for you to reach them.

### 3\. Select two key marketing channels

What’s your top of funnel? You need to pick the techniques appropriate to what
you’re selling, and to the audience targeted. It’s crazy how many businesses
don’t have a clear understanding of this.

### 4\. Design a sales process

What are the consistent steps you take people through from first contact to
conversion? Lead magnet, data capture, sales meetings, follow up, etc.

### 5\. Design a post-sale process

Essentially figuring out how you can maximise the LTV (lifetime value) of a
client when you have them, again in a systematised manner.

### 6\. Product systematisation

Free up time for sales and marketing activities by standardising the delivery
of your product or service as much as possible. Many failing businesses spend
far to much time and resources serving clients relative to getting new ones.

…it’s this kinda stuff.

The absolute king of tactics (not that he would necessarily position himself
this way) is Alex Hormozi.

If you read and apply his two books (_$100m Offers_ and _$100m Leads_), then I
think it’s very difficult to fail outright.

You’re probably not going to tear up any trees. But you will earn money.

So, if your business isn’t working, don’t let my material trick you.

Don’t think too far too fast. Do the boring stuff. Build the machine. Tick the
boxes.

And then you earn the right to play the game.
