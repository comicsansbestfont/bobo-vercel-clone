I love founder led businesses.

Aside from the obvious reason that they tend to be my clients, they have
certain qualities which are simply not shared by their corporate cousins.

For one thing, they take risks. They have to, because it’s only through such
risks that they are able to compete with corporate competitors who have ten
times the budgets to play with. This leads them into interesting strategic
territory; the provocative and contrarian plays that make them so charismatic.
Pretty much every “sexy” brand that anyone talks about is either founder led –
or failing that, a recent corporate acquisition cashing in on the credit it
built up as an independent.

For another thing, what they do is personal. The company is a direct
reflection of the boss themselves. They aren’t simply some MBA-for-hire, who
will be working for one of their competitors in 3 years time. They’re invested
– in a manner which goes far beyond the financial.

Such considerations make founder led brands palpably different propositions.
And frankly, when it comes to the metrics most of us care about, _better_
propositions. I’d rather give my money to them than the latest brand off the
GE conveyor belt – and I’d wager you would too.

Still, all that said, they aren’t without their problems.

Whilst being run in a dictatorial fashion supports brave and interesting
decision making, it doesn’t exactly furnish a professional or reliable company
culture. When an entire business has been built on the instinctive whims of
one or two individuals, it can be extremely hard to transition into
operational maturity; where decision making can be delegated without losing
the magic of the founder’s touch.

One of the best examples of this struggle could be seen in the spectacular
rise and fall of American Apparel under the leadership of Dov Charney.

In a nutshell Charney was kind of like the Steve Jobs of the clothing
industry: combining genius-level taste and instincts with a reputation of
being difficult to work with (which in Charney’s case may be something of an
understatement).

After guiding the company to the fastest American retail roll-out in history,
and becoming the largest t-shirt manufacturer in the country, Charney was
forced out by the board for conduct that “repeatedly put himself in a position
to be sued by numerous former employees for claims that include harassment,
discrimination and assault.”

Following his dismissal the brand promptly collapsed, filing for bankruptcy a
couple of years later. Perhaps trying to purge his legacy, the new corporate
leadership had made a number of “un-Charney-esque” strategic decisions,
missing the obvious point it was the Charney-esque that had made the business
click in the first place. Without this, it had no right to exist.

The story here is not that of Charney’s legendary impropriety (though
naturally that drew the eye and the headlines). No, it is of the company’s
inability to professionalise with Charney at the helm, and its inability to
function when his instincts were removed from the picture.

**Put simply American Apparel – like many others before and since – was never
able to codify their founder’s instincts into a strategy that others would be
able to run with and replicate.**

If they’d done so, things may have been very different. For one thing, the
business could have scaled smoothly – without descending into the level of
chaos that allowed such scandals to unfold. And for another, Charney’s
departure wouldn’t have hurt nearly as much. Sure, a visionary founder will
always offer a sprinkle of magic that can’t be replicated. But the crux of his
vision would have been right there, on paper, in a manner that could be taken
forward without him.

This then reveals the central responsibility of a successful founder:

**To make themselves obsolete.**

They must find a way to embed a “decision making logic” into the business
which enables others to think they way they do; to call things they way they
would; to see what they see.

Although this sounds a little risky for the founder in question, it’s been my
experience that most are _desperate_ to do this. Most founders know their
business relies too much on their say so, and would dearly welcome the
opportunity to delegate the majority of decisions and to take more of a “back
seat” – freeing themselves up for only the most important stuff.

(_It also makes their business a more sellable proposition, but that’s by-the-
by_).

The issue they have however isn’t one of _willing_.

Their issue is that _they don’t know the secret themselves_.

They don’t know how they make decisions. They don’t understand their own
minds. They aren’t able to unpack the underlying logic they’ve been working
to; the logic that’s made their business fly.

So much strategic thinking, contra the boffin-esque image, operates at the
level of the subconscious. When a founder picks option A over option B because
it just “feels right”, the decision isn’t necessarily “illogical” or purely
“emotional”. No, chances are there is a highly sophisticated logic in
operation – it’s just not one they’ve ever examined. They never had to.

**Doing this examination – knowing their own minds, drawing it forth, and
articulating it in a way others can understand – is what I call the “founder’s
dilemma”.**

It is what they all must go through if they ever are lucky enough to have a
hit on their hands – one that grows so big they can no longer competently
handle it in a dictatorial fashion.

(_Obviously founders of unsuccessful brands have no such dilemma, since
there’s no proof they have anything worth unpacking in the first place_).

Looking back on it, I’d say that many of my projects were essentially
exercises in solving the founder’s dilemma. The strategies I suggested were
“new”, sure, but often at the same time they were somehow _recognised_ by the
founders. They chimed with what they knew they were already doing, but had
never quite managed to put their fingers on.

Indeed I often say to clients, “we’ll know the strategy is right if it is
simultaneously embarrassingly obvious, and yet also has never been said
before”. That’s because such strategies are _resolutions_ of the founder’s
dilemma. Their “obviousness” stems from the fact they were there all along –
they just needed drawing out in order to be made usable.

So if you’re a founder, don’t make the same mistake Charney did. Not the
getting sued for assault bit – I trust you don’t need my advice on that one –
but the keeping the magic in your head bit.

You may not know what it is. But if you’ve made enough good decisions in a
row, and have the profit to prove it, then it’s definitely there.

Time for some introspection.
