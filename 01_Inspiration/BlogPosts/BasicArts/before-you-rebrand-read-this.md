Rebranding is one of the most disruptive, expensive, and significant exercises
any business can undertake.

And you know what?

_Generally it’s a complete waste of time._

This isn’t to say that most businesses don’t need to improve their brand and
brand strategy – they do. It’s just that when they do it they normally go
about it the wrong way – wasting not only the money it costs, but the
opportunity it represents.

Here I want to spell out for you best and worst approaches to rebranding a
business so that when you do it, you join the elite club for whom “brand”
really means something.

First, let’s look at the typical approach. I call this…

## Outfit branding

Outfit branding is what takes place in 99% (or more) branding projects. It is,
as the name suggests, an exercise in deciding what “outfit”, what “clothes”, a
business will wear.

Basically you take your business to the agency and you say “hey, here’s what
we’ve got, make it look as appealing as possible”. And sure enough, they’ll do
just that. They’ll give you a great looking logo, packaging, website, and
general aesthetic. They’ll also give you some beautiful snappy copy to go with
it. The goal of all this will be to present your current business in the _best
possible light_. And, for most of us, that’s what we want from the project.
That’s all we expect.

So what’s the problem?

Well the thing is, such a project doesn’t generally have an especially
profound effect on the company’s performance. It’s certainly fun, it certainly
feels good, and _occasionally_ it can move the needle (especially if the prior
branding was hideous)… but fundamentally it’s superficial. Just as a new
outfit won’t turn the average bloke on the street into Carey Grant, so too
will new branding fail to turn your business into anything special.

The reason for this is simple.

True “brand” – meaning the presence and reputation you hold in the market – is
not created simply by the image you present to the world. It’s created by a
combination of all the parts of your business working in unison:

_Product + distribution + format + price + culture + aesthetic + communication
+ etc._

A business is a “whole” which should be greater than the sum of its parts. The
great brands are those where the whole is exceptionally coherent and unified.
Where every part of the business is “branded”, if you like.

When you take one of those parts like your aesthetic and work on it in
_isolation_ , without working on the other parts simultaneously, then you do
nothing to create that alignment. You’re just putting lipstick on a pig, as
the saying goes.

This then reveals the alternative, and optimal, form of branding which we
might call whole company branding.

Whole company branding, rather than just putting lipstick on the pig, actually
works on the pig itself. It brings into play certain questions which are
normally absent from rebranding exercises, such as:

  * Range; do we need to add / remove products to match this new identity?
  * Format; do we need to change the way we deliver the product?
  * Manufacturing; do we need to change the way we make things to match our promises?
  * Distribution; does this identity lend itself better to some channels than others?
  * Culture; does this influence the kinds of people we should hire?
  * Etc. etc.

The goal is to shift the entire company _as one unit_ , and bring it into
sharp focus so everything is singing in harmony.

I understand that, in theory, some superficial branding exercises might be
aimed at bringing the aesthetic of the company into line with the rest of the
business. Like it’s “the last piece of the puzzle”, which will then unify
everything. But realistically that is not normally the goal of a rebrand.

Normally companies decide to rebrand when they want to _change_. When they
feel the status quo isn’t quite working for them. Rebranding is not typically
a conservative exercise, it’s a revolutionary one.

So therefore, if you feel the need to change things, then damn well change
them. Evolve the _whole thing_. Don’t just stick a band-aid on it, the way
most rebranding exercises do.

#### **So why doesn’t everyone do this?**

We might ask at this point why whole company branding – if it’s so great –
isn’t the norm?

It all comes down to the way businesses approach strategy.

For normal businesses there is a difference between “business strategy”, and
“brand strategy”.

The “business strategy” is of course the way the business seeks to get
leverage in the market. Generally, especially with large corporate brands who
establish the norms of “best practice” which all other brands follow, _this
will not be consumer oriented_.

A _consumer oriented_ strategy is one which aims to get leverage by what is
offered to the consumer; a _non-consumer oriented_ strategy is one which gets
leverage by other means, such as efficient deployment of resources.

Now non-consumer oriented business strategies are fine, but they have one
flaw: you can’t use them to design your brand. That’s why businesses have to
come up with a separate brand strategy.

A [brand strategy](https://basicarts.org/work-with-us/) – the strategy of how
you present the business – needs to be consumer oriented. Therefore old school
businesses end up with not one, but two parallel strategies:

**Business strategy** – not consumer oriented  
**+**  
**Brand strategy** – consumer oriented

This “dual strategy” model is what has shaped the branding industry as we know
it today. It has siloed brand away from the “real business”, leaving it as a
purely stylistic endeavour which doesn’t touch the other parts. This has led
to branding agencies becoming hyper-creative, but not particularly good at the
business side of the equation. This is fair enough – under this model it’s not
their job. They’re just there to “do the pictures”. They are free to create
brand strategies which are pure style, but have no business substance at their
heart.

Because of all this, when you operate a dual strategy model, whole business
branding becomes impossible.

You can’t use the business strategy to inform the brand, because it’s not
consumer oriented. And you can’t use the brand strategy to shape the business,
because it’s superficial.

Whole company branding requires _one strategy which unifies everything_. And
that must be:

_A consumer oriented business strategy._

A consumer oriented business strategy is simultaneously able to define how the
business will get leverage in the market AND how it will present itself.

Take IKEA as an example. Their business strategy essentially boils down to
this:

_Provide designer furniture that’s so cheap anyone can buy it._

That’s it. It’s clear, it illustrates their market offering, and is centred on
providing consumer value. The way they are able to do this is of course via
their revolutionary flat-packed system, plus various other logistical
strengths which lower costs, and open more room for design investment.

Now because it’s consumer oriented, it also acts as a good brand strategy. All
they have to do for their brand is take the business strategy, and
rearticulate it in a jazzy sexy way. You’re simply saying “here’s what we
offer”, but you’re doing it in an attractive style. And that’s just what they
did, summarised in their tagline:

_The Wonderful Everyday._

This slogan quite literally means you can have world class design
(“wonderful”) in your normal humdrum life whoever you are (“everyday”). It’s
just presented nicely.

That’s exactly what branding should be. The business strategy – which is
activated across the whole company – dressed up pretty.

In conclusion then:

  * Great companies don’t treat branding as a superficial outfit
  * Great companies practice whole company branding
  * The way they are able to do this is by having a consumer-oriented business strategy
  * This enables them to unify all parts of the business, including brand, under one single thought

Any rebranding exercise should start at the top – business strategy – and
cascade outwards across the whole enterprise.

Very very few businesses do this.

And that means all the more rewards for the few that do.
