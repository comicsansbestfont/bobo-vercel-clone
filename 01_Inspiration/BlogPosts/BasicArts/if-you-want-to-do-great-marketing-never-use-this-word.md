As long time readers will know, my views on business begin and end with one
simple belief:

**Business is the practice of delivering value to people.**

That’s it. Each and every company is nothing more than a system designed to
give value, and thus receive it in return. Sure, you can create a business
that doesn’t do this – even an extremely successful one, financially speaking.
But that’s a corruption of the game, not the game itself.  _Real_ business,
the  _pure_ sauce, is all about value provision.

It’s the simplest, most effective, most ethical, and most enjoyable way of
doing things.

Now if you share this belief you will be led to a further conclusion: that
marketing is the most important activity a business undertakes. Why? Because
marketing is the process by which you determine what value you’re going to
offer.

Think about it. Marketing quite literally means the process of “navigating the
market”: in other words understanding the market and all the other forms of
value being delivered within it, and thus where there’s a gap for you to add
your own. Value after all is something which is determined from  _outside_ of
the company; it exists where the business meets the real world – and since
marketing is the one and only  _externally_ focused discipline in the
organisational mix, is the one that does the big job.

**In short, for the value-focused organisation, marketing means deciding and
articulating _what the business actually does_.**

Pretty important stuff.

Still, although you might agree with me here in theory, I dare say that the
picture I’ve painted above bears little resemblance to marketing the way
you’ve seen it done. How often have you seen a marketing department “decide
what the business actually does”? I’m guessing never. Most businesses don’t
only suck at marketing; they don’t even do it. And this isn’t because they
don’t invest in it or don’t care about it – on the contrary, in my experience
investment in marketing is often  _inversely correlated_ with actually doing
it properly.

Heck, I’m even going to go out on a limb and say that if you want to know
something about marketing, don’t ask a marketer. (OK this is going a bit far,
but let’s have a bit of rhetorical fun here).

I’ve thought long and hard about why this is – why “marketing” is so bad at
actual  _marketing_ – and here I want to reveal my conclusion.

It all comes down to one little word. A word which, if you allow it to pass
your lips, has the potential to sink you. A word which I would advise you to
pretty much ban from your organisation if you want to excel at marketing.

The word?

**Marketing.**

Yes, the word marketing itself is the biggest enemy to the marketing function,
and I don’t only mean this rhetorically, but sincerely.

The reason, as many good marketers may sadly know, is that “marketing” no
longer means what it used to mean. In the past it meant just what I described
above – the process of navigating the market, and figuring out what a business
should do if it wanted to deliver value. This is why the famous “4 Ps” of
marketing were developed – product, price, place, promotion. Taken together
these represented pretty much the  _entirety_ of a business’s presence in the
outside world (i.e. in the market), and thus represented the  _whole_ business
from the point of view of an external observer. All other disciplines
(finance, manufacturing, HR etc.) were internal operational functions which
made the cogs turn, but were always in humble service to final manifestation
defined by those Ps.

Now however “marketing”, in its common usage, only means one of those Ps:
promotion. It is seen simply as the discipline of “spreading the word” about
the business. Of “packaging” it as nicely as possible. Of making a noise. This
is what marketing departments, marketing agencies, marketing directors, etc.
invariably  _do_. This and little more.

I should stress right now that there’s nothing wrong with this per se. Firstly
definitions change, often for good reason, and if that’s what the word
“marketing” means now then that’s fine, no problem. Also let’s make no mistake
that the modern promotion-focused form of marketing is still extremely
important – more so than ever. Many marketers do a great – and crucial – job
with this more limited remit. And many great brands have been built on the
strength of packaging and promo alone.

No, the issue isn’t really with what marketing has become; it’s with the
vacuum that’s been left behind.

Quite simply there is no “word” for the discipline of deciding what a business
does from an external, value-oriented perspective. The closest we have is
“strategy”, and I often use the word for this purpose, but strictly speaking
it’s not 100% correct. For one thing strategy is, in theory, broader than just
the value-oriented parts of a business. And for another, as we know, nobody
knows what it means anyway, so it’s hardly an effective replacement!

As a result of this vacuum most brands are content to simply not do real
marketing at all, which means:

  * Not asking the question of what value the business actually provides
  * Allowing that question to be answered either randomly or though subconscious copying of competitors (therefore delivering the same value as everyone else)
  * And then trying to make up for it with effort, promotion, and cost cutting (the key “strategic levers” of 95% of brands)

Perhaps this sounds familiar.

So if that’s the gripe, then what’s the solution?

Well there are many great “proper” marketers out there who are aware of this
problem, and are fighting the good fight in order to restore marketing to its
proper definition and place. I’m sure a lot of them read this newsletter.
Perhaps the most famous of these (though he doesn’t read the newsletter so far
as I know) is Mark Ritson, who does a brilliant job of educating marketers in
what they’re actually supposed to be doing. However I was at an event of his a
few weeks ago, and I asked him how much confidence he has of wrestling the
word back to its original meaning, and the answer was, in essence, “not much”.
When broad cultural forces, operating at a higher level than any of us can
unpack, successfully change the meaning and function of an entire business
discipline on a global level, it’s pretty ambitions to think you’re going to
be able to “undo” those effects.

That’s why my suggestion is to simply abandon the word altogether. Or at least
to let it mean what it wants to mean (promotion), and to start having proper
marketing conversations using different language in a different space.

You see a funny thing happens when a business doesn’t think about marketing or
talk about marketing. They actually start to  _do_ marketing.

I’ve witnessed this effect with a number of clients who had either non-
existent or extremely weak marketing departments. Invariably they did a better
job than those who invested a lot in the function and were supposedly
“marketing led”. The reason for this is because when nobody is doing
marketing,  _everybody_ starts to do it – which is exactly how it should be.
Marketing, as I’ve stressed, is a “whole business activity”, which needs to
shape all decisions and bond them together as a unit. In businesses with a
marketing department, marketing decisions get sucked into a silo which isn’t
empowered to direct the rest of the organisation, and so the whole process
effectively vanishes. But when there’s no marketing department these decisions
become the concern of the everybody, including the CEO – which means they are
able to take the precedence they deserve.

I dare say you’ve heard the phrase “marketing is too important to be left to
the marketing department”? Well, that’s what this means. It means in a world
where marketing departments are only empowered to do a small part of the
marketing job, the rest of it needs to be picked up at a higher level – or
indeed by the whole business combined.

These conversations won’t be framed in the language of “marketing”. Because
everyone’s brains are so attuned to the modern definition that would quickly
make the conversation descend to a promotional level. No, they will be framed
in much bigger language:

  * “What are we doing here?”
  * “What is the point of this?”
  * “What do we do for people?”
  * “Where can we get leverage?”
  * Etc.

This is real marketing, but you mustn’t tell anyone, because if you do you’ll
be talking about ads and taglines in no time.

How this will be shaped will be different for every organisation, but just to
get your juices flowing, imagine if in addition to having a marketing director
(who looks after promo), you also had an “offering director” or “value
director” who looked after the existential stuff. I’m not proposing this as a
solution, but merely illustrating the kind of paradigm shift that’s required
to get businesses to start focusing on this stuff again.

Elsewhere, while my advice here is primarily for business leaders, this
principle counts double, or even triple, for anyone who is somehow engaged in
“marketing services” such as an agency or consultancy. You might be the finest
“proper marketer” in the world, and understand everything I’ve written above
far better than I do, BUT the very second you tell a client you do “marketing”
_they will never give you the remit to make proper high level marketing
decisions_. You will be boxed into promo, and there’s no swimming up stream
from there. Your fate will be sealed.

Bottom line here, I don’t think “marketing” (the word) is coming back. It
means promo, and that’s totally fine, and the industry should continue to
develop and thrive in that direction. It’s exciting, powerful, and important
work. However I do think that  _marketing_ (the discipline) can come back. All
it needs is decoupling from its terminology and it will thrive.

Trust me, people are crying out for it. Businesses need it. Professionals want
to do it. And yet it’s barely done at all.

What an opportunity right? So together let’s try and make it happen.
