A couple of years ago I heard an executive from Quorn speak at a conference.

Normally talks like these are just boring propaganda pieces, but his was
usually thoughtful and candid. One point he made that stuck with me was that
whilst people, in general, are eating less meat, pure veganism isn’t actually
growing. Quite interesting coming from a brand like Quorn, and very much
against the anecdotal grain you hear from brands at the moment.

What I particularly enjoyed however was his barely disguised frustration with
the emergence of brands such as Beyond Meat and the Impossible Burger.

His complaint?

That those two have somehow done the impossible: they’ve tricked millions of
people into believing they invented the veggie burger.

Of course, they don’t call what they make “veggie burgers”, because that would
give the game away. Instead, they use product differentiation and terms like
“fake meat” or “plant-based meat”. But let’s face it, the distinction is a bit
potato-potahto – and that’s certainly what the Quorn guy thought, who was
understandably annoyed that these brands were gathering untold hype and
capital on the back of ideas which Quorn, Linda McCartney, and various others
had been doing without fanfare for decades.

_(I know some will take issue with this, and claim that these brands have
brought something fresh to the table (“they bleed!” etc.), but really that’s
just old fashioned USP stuff. The larger point is that they are occupying the
same market space – meat free burgers, sausages, etc. – and that is
demonstrably nothing new.)_

Brands like this are, I think, pretty interesting.

What they’ve achieved is something close to alchemy: where they’ve taken an
old tired idea, relaunched it, and made everyone believe it’s something fresh
and exciting.

They aren’t the only ones by any means. Oatly, for example, didn’t invent oat
milk; but so far as the man on the street is concerned they might as well
have. Another one is Huel – who are, let’s face it, just a trendy Slimfast.

Such brands prove you don’t have to be original in order to make people
believe you’re original. They show that true innovation is perhaps overrated;
and that there might be more legs in pre-existing ideas than in dazzling new
ones.

So how did they do it?

**The answer is _rearticulation_.**

How you articulate an idea is the way you _describe_ and _present_ it. The way
you make it make sense to people. Every idea has multiple possible
articulations, and each one has the potential to make the penny drop with a
different audience.

When you rearticulate an idea, you simply describe it using a different
vocabulary. You frame it differently. And in doing this, you make it new.

A good example of this is the trend of mindfulness that has swept the world in
the last decade or two.

There is nothing original about the _content_ of mindfulness of course. It
isn’t a new invention, and doesn’t claim to be. It is instead a new framing
for various ancient ideas which weren’t clicking with most people in their
prior guises. Just like fake meat, it’s an old idea made new through clever
repackaging.

As you can see, rearticulating old ideas is a pretty profitable strategy. In
fact, you might argue that it’s even better than being truly original, since
the ideas are pre-tested. They’ve been proven to work for some people, so it’s
quite probable they’ll work for others too. I remember around the turn of the
millennium that there was a trend for converting Shakespeare plays into teen
movies. What a great idea. No need to think of a new story; just steal from
the best and dress it in a different outfit. It worked for _The Lion King_ ,
and it worked for them too.

As the likes of Oatly show, there’s a lot potential for [building
brands](https://basicarts.org/why-are-startup-brands-so-boring/) in the
rearticulation technique. All you really need to do is:

  1. Identify a stale product category that has faded in the public consciousness, or which appeals only to a niche set of consumers
  2. Connect that product with a new audience or culture who might in principle be interested in it under a different guise
  3. Then simply rearticulate it for them; put it in their language

The key factor is the weak / limited articulation of the original concept. You
couldn’t play this game with, say, gyms, because the root idea is too popular
and well understood – you’d have to genuinely innovate instead. But you could
perhaps play it with something like Weight Watchers, which represents a solid
core idea with very hard limits on its appeal in its current guise. (After
writing this I checked, and yes, a brand called Noom is already attacking this
one with their product differentiation).

So bottom line, perhaps originality is overrated. Perhaps there is more value
in expanding the reach of existing ideas than there is in coming up with new
ones.

Just because something’s out there already, doesn’t mean it’s truly arrived.

And that means the next big thing is probably already here. Someone just needs
to steal it.
