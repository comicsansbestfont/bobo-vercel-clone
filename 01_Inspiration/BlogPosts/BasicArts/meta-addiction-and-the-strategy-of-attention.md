Clearly, it’s hard to take Mark Zuckerberg seriously.

This has always been the case, however it’s been particularly on display in
the last couple of weeks following his awkward video announcement of Meta –
the new name for Facebook’s holding company.

I’m sure you’re already familiar with it, but in short the idea is for them to
spearhead the creation of the “metaverse”, a thing they describe as “the next
evolution of social connection”, but which you and I might basically call
virtual reality. If the first step of “social connection” was for them to get
us all to connect, chat, and shout at each other through our phones, the next
step will be for us to do the same thing from _inside_ our phones – plugging
ourselves directly into Facebook, walking around in it, and if they have their
way basically living in it.

Sounds wholesome right?

Well, this is where Zuckerberg’s innate ridiculousness comes in handy. If the
devil’s greatest trick was convincing people he didn’t exist, then the Zuck’s
greatest trick is convincing people his ideas are dumb, because few are taking
Meta very seriously.

It is undeniably pretty dorky, especially the VR part. This technology has
been around for a while now, and so far has been closer to 3D TVs than
smartphones in terms of world changing impact – and so it’s understandable
that people are pretty dismissive of its utopian (or dystopian) potential
under Meta.

However, as some slightly more subtle commentators have observed, perhaps this
is beside the point.

Just because we aren’t strapping on headsets, that doesn’t mean that the
metaverse isn’t imminent. Indeed, I was struck the other day when someone said
that if more than 50% of your attention is directed online, then you’re
_already_ living in it.

It’s a compelling point. We typically assume that the online world exists to
serve the offline one, where we lead our “real lives”. However if 51% of your
attention is directed online, and 49% is offline, then isn’t the opposite be
true? Aren’t the offline things you’re doing – eating, sleeping, going to the
toilet – simply “tools and services” that support your _really_ real life, the
online one?

I’d say so. Whether your attention is filtered through a screen or a headset
is really neither here nor there.

Now I don’t bring all this up purely for the purpose of lamenting the
direction we’re heading (although I did have a chuckle when someone mentioned
that in Hebrew the word “meta” means “dead”, thus making the metaverse a “dead
universe”). No, that’s all well and good, but not my remit here.

Instead I bring it up because of what it teaches us about that innocuous,
under-appreciated word:

**“Attention”.**

We all know what attention is of course, but I’d suggest that few of us take
time to consider just how important it is. Attention, we might say, is our
most valuable resource – not only because it is finite (like time), but also
because it is _transformative_.

I’m sure you’ve heard the saying “where your attention goes, your energy
flows”? Well this is a pretty big deal when you think about it. The things you
“attend to” are not only given energy, given “life”, by your attention – _they
also transform you in their image_.

A person who directs 70% of their attention at cultivating their Instagram
presence (for example) will end up being completely moulded by that behaviour.
They won’t just be a person who happens to be living online. They will instead
become an “online person” – someone who is optimised to the demands of that
platform, the way an organism is optimised for its environment.

We can see this same transformation when we consider the nature of addiction.
A drug addict is, in effect, someone who _attends_ , in an out of proportion
manner, to drugs. It is to drugs that their “energy flows”, and in turn it is
around drugs that their life and persona are gradually shaped. Like the
Instagram fanatic, they become a tool of their “idol”, living to serve the
thing that should be serving them. It is this _transformation_ which defines
the condition.

Now naturally as a consequence of this process attention can be used for
positive transformation as well as negative. That’s the good news. The only
problem is very few of us ever bother to choose where our attention is
directed.

What happens instead is that our attention is _attracted_ to something (social
media, food, booze, power, pornography, etc.), and we feel the urge to attend
to it. We interpret this urge as “choice”, and therefore validate and indulge
it. “I want to give my attention to this thing, therefore by doing so I am
taking an empowering act”. But of course this is an illusion. Urges are not
choices; they are where your attention flows when it is on auto-pilot. The
free act is not to give in to your urges, but to _reject_ them, and to
_choose_ to give your attention to the things that are less tempting – as only
then can you be sure that you have exercised any agency over the situation at
all.

That is a little abstract, so to put it more simply just ask yourself: is the
drug addict more free when he does what he “wants” and takes a hit, or when he
_resists_ what he wants, and doesn’t?

You get the point.

Through these dynamics then we can start to develop a “strategy of attention”
which we can use for our advantage. It comes down to recognising two key
points:

  1. **The thing we pay attention to transforms us**

and…

  2. **The thing we feel an urge to pay attention to is not chosen by us, but rather _chooses us._ Free choice is only present when we _reject_ what we automatically desire, and _choose_ what we might not**

Using these points we can analyse where we devote our attention, consider its
transformative consequences, and ask if there is somewhere else it would be
better directed.

For an interesting example of this theory in action, consider the act of
religious worship.

Worship, on the face of it, seems like quite an arbitrary thing – even to a
lot of believers. However when we view it through the lens of attention, it
makes a lot more sense. After all, worship at its heart is simply deliberate
focused attention. Just like any attention, it is transformative. However
unlike other forms of attention the worshipper has chosen the _highest thing_
as the focus for their transformation. Whilst some people might be transformed
by their (unchosen) attention to Instagram, say, the worshipper tries to be
transformed by their (chosen) attention to God.

Taken to an extreme, a monk might devote their _entire attention_ to worship:
a radical act of transformation and “elevation” which may be considered a sort
of reversal of addiction: the freely chosen “upward” transformation, versus
the unchosen “downward” transformation.

Naturally one need not be religious to understand this idea. There are all
sorts of constructive ways to direct one’s attention when you get the
principle. And, perhaps more importantly, there are all sorts of destructive
things one can _stop_ attending to – when you realise that the attention is
neither benign nor necessarily a reflection of free will.

**Now in case you’re worried this is starting to sound like a bit of a
moralistic lecture, rest assured that we can apply _precisely_ the same logic
to businesses too.**

Just like people, businesses direct their attention to certain places. And
again, just like people, the object of their attention has a transformative
effect which may be positive or negative.

The role of a well defined strategy is essentially to give a business
something to pay attention to – or even “worship”, if you like. By turning all
attention to a strategy the business will be transformed in its image – whilst
also being distracted from other less useful things trying to distract it.

This is why some businesses put their strategy on the wall, where everyone can
see it and be reminded of it. This is almost like the corporate version of
hanging a crucifix: it is a reminder of where one’s attention should be
focused, lest it begin to drift in a less constructive direction.

You can see then that it’s not enough to simply “have” a strategy – just like
it’s not enough to say you believe in certain high minded principles. What
counts is whether you attend to it. Whether you devote time, discussion, and
consideration to it. Whether it occupies a high percentage of your time.

A strategy that you develop, think about for a moment, and then ignore for the
remaining 99% of your time simply doesn’t exist. In that case your _real_
strategy is what’s going on in that 99%; that’s the thing that’s shaping who
you are, and what you’re going to become.

It’s like a pal of mine once said: “I never believe people when they say
what’s important to them, what they care about; I simply look at what they do
and then infer the truth from that”.

So there you have it. No matter what your supposed principles are, what you
say matters to you, what you think you believe, the only thing that ultimately
matters is whether that is reflected by your attention.

The way it’s spent is by far the truest reflection of who you are, and who you
will become.
