Sometimes the old ways are indeed the best. You might be familiar with the
concept of the four, or latterly seven “ps” that comprise marketing – product,
price, promotion, place, process, people, physical environment. Whilst this
list has been around for a long time (the original variation cropping up
around 1960), it actually represents a far more cutting edge approach to
marketing than that seen in the vast majority of contemporary businesses.

Marketing today has come to be almost synonymous with “advertising”, or to put
it another way “promotion” in the list of ps. Few are the marketing
departments which are defining business processes, designing the products,
managing the people, building the physical environments, etc., however today
as we have seen it is this holistic, “total business”, approach to marketing
which is essential to build a coherent and inspiring brand.

It makes sense up to a point that marketing got trapped in this narrow
definition, since twenty years ago the primary battleground where brands
fought was in paid media. The only way information could really travel or get
purchase with the public psyche was if it had a huge amount of money to
support it. Unsupported pieces of information – say the type produced by a
normal person – quickly dissolved away. The chances are that if you won the
promotion wars then you won the game full stop, even if your business was
technically an inferior one to a competitor. After all, who’s going to buy
them if nobody’s heard of them? Thus marketing adopted a very outwards-facing
mindset, turning their back on the real business, seeing it as almost
incidental as to whether it became successful or not. This created countless
farcical situations where brand teams and agencies would agonise over how to
position and sell a sub standard product, with nobody ever thinking to say
“hey, what if we just changed the product?”.

Contributing to this superficial approach was the very idea of the “marketing
department” in the first place. Most businesses are divided into different
departments each with a different responsibility; HR, sales, manufacturing,
marketing, etc. These departments, for obvious reason of symmetry, are
generally all of equal seniority, lined up side by side, sitting perhaps
underneath a board of directors. Generally this makes pretty good sense – but
not for marketing. If we think of marketing not as a department, but as a
discipline, we can see that it is the body of thought which essentially
defines what a business’s role in the world is. Why is it here? What’s the
point of all this? If you answer that question well, and then deliver on it
across all the ps (however many of them there might be), then you’ll have a
great business on your hands, one which is doing great marketing every day
just through its very existence. This means that rather than being a
department that sits alongside all the others, marketing done correctly should
instead be an umbrella approach which sits over them – ensuring that
everything is done in a joined-up and on-message kind of way.

It is for this reason that many of the new breed of inspiring brands – whose
marketing everyone admires so much – actually have no marketing department at
all. They know that to have a dedicated marketing department sends the message
that actually fulfilling the business’s place in the world isn’t everyone’s
responsibility – a bad move in today’s world. They might have a publicity
department (which is essentially what most marketing departments are these
days), but the responsibility for defining what the brand stands for sits at a
much higher level, and is activated by everyone in their own field.

So what’s the best way to place marketing internally? Whilst the traditional
department model is clearly not ideal, there’s not necessarily any one “best”
alternative – you just need to make sure that everybody is involved. If you
already have a marketing department, you might simply repurpose them so they
sit across all your other departments, helping keeping them all aligned and
operating creatively. Or you might re-label them something more appropriate
like the “promotion” or “publicity” department, and instead assign someone in
every other department the role of “brand thinker” whose responsibility it is
to ensure that their department acts in an distinctive way. Or you might try
something completely different. Many businesses now are adding the role of
“creative director” to their organisations as they start to take creative
control back from their externally-focussed agencies.

Ultimately the answer to the question will depend largely on what the current
status quo is in your organisation, and how you can most smoothly manage the
transition. So long as you find a way to bring that kind of thinking to every
corner of your business, you’ll immediately be far ahead of the competition.
