Sometimes people ask me the meaning of my company name, Basic Arts.

It came from the original idea I had for the business, which in essence was to
embed advertising-esque creativity and artistry into the very fabric of the
company itself, rather than limiting it to external “media”.

**Basic** = foundational, structural, the bones of the business  
**Arts** = creative flair

As an example consider the way that Hiut Denim have their seamstresses sign
their name on the inside of the jeans they put together; or the jokes told by
Southwest cabin crew; or the flagship Vans store which is an underground skate
park; or the way that Alo yoga clothes come with a subscription to their
online class platform. These are juicy, “talkable” enhancements to these
brands which do the same job as a great ad campaign – only they are
_permanently woven into the operations of the companies themselves_.

“Make interesting companies, not interesting advertising” was my way of
summing this up.

In recent years I have shifted to focusing more on the strategy that
_generates these ideas_ , rather than the ideas themselves – but this doesn’t
mean that I’m any less committed to this original idea of embedded creativity
than I was before.

Therefore in this piece, I want to expand on it by introducing the idea of the
“creative canvas” – an essential tool in building a business like this.

**To understand this idea, we first have to be clear on what the role for
creativity in a business actually is.**

_(Sorry to teach you to suck eggs here, but just to get everyone on the same
page)_

Starting at the top, we must root everything in the realisation that the job
of a business – any business – is to _deliver value_. There is categorically
nothing more to business than this; indeed it is the very definition of the
term. _A business is a system that has been designed to deliver value in one
form, and to collect value in another form in return_. Any founder who always
has this simple concept front of mind is destined to go far.

That settled, we can move down a level to _brand_. What is its role?

Obviously, a lot of bullshit is written about this topic (more so than
anything else in human affairs perhaps!), however again, like business, it has
a very simple purpose: to _communicate_ the value the business is delivering.
That’s it. Communication of value. Anything else is a bonus.

This leaves us with a simple model:

**The role of a business** -> to deliver value  
**The role of its brand** -> to communicate that value

Now naturally, even if your business delivers tremendous value, that second
job is hard. To do it effectively you need to be:

  * Clear, so people can “get it” in an instant
  * Noisy, because if nobody notices you everything else is academic
  * Viscerally appealing, because, well, people like nice stuff obviously
  * And of course memorable

This is where creativity comes in. Great brands are those who have used
artistic creativity to communicate their [value
proposition](https://basicarts.org/what-does-a-strong-value-offering-look-
like/) in a manner that fulfills these requirements.

So far this is all pretty standard stuff. Just good tidy branding. Where
things get different is the next level down – where you _execute_ that
creativity.

**Your _canvas_.**

In the world of traditional branding, the canvas is pretty limited. It
essentially boils down to any “media” which the brand has at its disposal,
which typically means:

  * Logo
  * Website
  * Packaging
  * Sales materials
  * Social media channels
  * Bought media (i.e. ads)

These represent the “space” on which you can tell your story, and do groovy
creative things.

Now clearly these are important, and should be exploited as much as possible –
but the true potential for creative expression in a business is far broader
than that. You can add idiosyncrasies to every single touchpoint of your
consumer journey. You don’t need to be restricted to the “2D” world of images,
but can also manifest in the “3D” world of operations.

The process of building your creative canvas is to “map” these opportunities
for your own business, so you are left with broad range of spaces where you
might come up with and execute interesting ideas.

Imagine for instance if you ran a chain of gyms. To build your canvas you
would need to break down your entire structural operation, assets, and
customer journey – anything with creative potential. E.g.:

  * Where should a gym chain with this proposition be located? What are we communicating with our geographical footprint?
  * What kind of classes should we offer? What is in and out of our scope? Is there a new form of class which we should invent which you can’t get anywhere else?
  * What sort of membership packages should we offer? How can we get creative in our pricing, our tiers, our cancellation policies?
  * What sort of equipment should we stock? How should we organise it on the floor? What should the “flow” around the space be?
  * What about our staff? What sort of people should work at this gym? How should they be employed? How should they interact with our customers?
  * What about our changing rooms? Should we even have changing rooms? Lockers, soap, hair dryers, mirrors; do we have a slant on any of this stuff?
  * What secondary amenities should we have? Things like saunas, cafes, vending machines, lounges? Is there something most people have which we choose not to have? Is there something that only we have?

I could go on and on, but I think you get the point.

All of these things are just as relevant for creative expression as a 30
second ad is – in fact more so, because once executed they continue
_communicating_ indefinitely, and more than communicating they actually help
_deliver_ on your proposition too.

Every business should go through an exercise of mapping its own creative
canvas like this. What are all the things which you might potentially twist in
a branded way? These then should be “briefed” creatively just like any piece
of media, using your strategy as the point of focus – and the resulting ideas
should be evaluated in the same way:

**Will this get noticed?**  
**Is it exciting?**  
**Does it say precisely what we want to say?**

Compounded together, the sum of such creatively aligned parts will be a
business which glows with such charisma and clarity that traditional forms of
branding will become increasingly unimportant

_(This is why various brands who do this well, such as Lush, have been able to
adopt “no-advertising” policies)._

I have used gyms here as an example because they have an unusually rich
creative canvas to play with. Unfortunately not all kinds of businesses are so
lucky. FMCG brands in particular have a few levers to pull in this regard –
little more than the product on shelf – hence why they lean so heavily on
traditional branding.

The one FMCG brand to have overcome this limitation is Red Bull, who
effectively built a whole new business onto the side of their core company
with which to express themselves creatively. This is their genius, and
certainly represents one option for brands with a limited canvas.

However, being realistic, such extraordinary lengths are beyond the limits of
most of us – so we have to think laterally instead. No matter how limited your
canvas appears, there will be more opportunities for strategic thinking around
creativity than you think.

For example, an FMCG brand might want to think about:

**Product** – It should be an obvious one, but you need to consider how you
can adapt your product to fulfil / communicate your proposition more
explicitly. On the subject of Red Bull, they did this beautifully by making
their product taste horrible and come in smaller volumes than other soft
drinks. Why did this work? Because these “negatives” _signalled_ the product’s
potency, which amplified their core “energy” proposition.

**Format** – Most brands come in the same rough format as all their
competitors. But they don’t have to. Tony’s Chocolonely, despite focusing
their messaging on their anti-slavery proposition, actually owe far more of
their rapid growth to the usual _thickness_ of their bars. It seems like a
tiny change, but it bought a whole new level of joy and decadence to the
category: one which is fast being followed by other brands.

**Distribution** – Where you are seen has the potential to say just as much
about you as any ad campaign. Look at Oatly; a brand built _almost entirely_
on performative distribution. They rose to prominence by pushing their
“barista edition” oat milk into speciality coffee shops around the world.
Commercially this wasn’t the heart of the business, but raw sales wasn’t the
point – _communication_ was, and they realised this was the most powerful
piece of brand building they could do.

These three companies are solid examples of just how much creative brand
building you can do outside of traditional media work, even when it seems like
you have very little to play with.

We should never make the mistake of siloing creativity into the superficial,
secondary parts of our business. We should never draw a line between the
“serious stuff” of the core company, and the “fun stuff” on the periphery.
Great brands are _inherently_ interesting, and need no borrowed credibility
from a jazzy ad, celebrity tie in, or viral post to prove that.

Your company should be its own ad.

And, after [strategic thinking](https://basicarts.org/newsletter/),
understanding your creative canvas is the most important step to making that
happen.
