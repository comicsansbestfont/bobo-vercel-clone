One question new clients tend to ask when we begin working together, is “what
do I get at the end of this?”.

Naturally, they get a strategy – and all the ensuing clarity, growth, fame and
fortune that goes with it. But that’s not really what they mean. What they
mean is what actual “thing” will be produced.

It’s a fair question, since unlike a website, ad campaign, manufacturing
plant, or spritely new employee, nobody knows what a “strategy” actually looks
like. How it’s delivered and disseminated; what you actually hold in your
hand, what you look at.

Given that it’s essentially a piece of information, there are an unlimited
number of ways you could go about formatting it. Most common no doubt is “The
Deck”, probably containing a few pillars, visions, purpose statements and so
on.

Common, but in my opinion not quite right.

Imagine, for a second, that you have a great strategy. It’s tight, it’s
exciting, it’s clever. Then imagine finding yourself in a bar, chatting to a
prospective investor / employee / dating option, and the conversation gets
around to it. How do you explain it to them?

First up, you’re not whipping out a diagram. Any strategy that needs a drawing
of some sort to explain it has already got some serious problems. And second,
you’re not going to spit a bunch of jargon or “copy” at them. You’re a human
trying to communicate with another human, after a couple of drinks, so there’s
no room for corporate spin here.

No, instead you know what you do? You just explain it to them! You open your
mouth, form some sentences, and try to string them together into a compelling
argument, culminating in the punchline of what your strategy is.

That’s all there is to it. So why in the business environment would things be
any different?

The way you’d tell someone about your strategy is the way you write it. A
single page of A4, with a few paragraphs of argument, which lay out the plan
and why it works. Easy.

There are many reasons why a mini-essay like this is the best way to lay down
a strategy, for instance:

**1 – It can be read rather than presented**

PowerPoint is a magnificent program, and I won’t hear a word said against it.
But did you ever stop and think about what it’s actually for? _Presentations_.
It’s a presentation tool. And that means it’s designed to be accompanied by
the _spoken word_ – though you wouldn’t know it from the state of most decks.

To make a strategy sharable you don’t want to have to be “presenting” it all
the time, and that’s why Microsoft, in their wisdom, came up with another
(criminally underused) tool: Word. Word is designed to create documents that
are read, not presented. And that’s why it should be used here. By laying down
the full explanation of your strategy as a piece of writing, you’ll never need
to “walk anyone through it” ever again.

**2 – It allows for an argument structure**

Although a strategy will always be wrapped up in a sentence or phrase which
summarises it, we shouldn’t forget that a full strategy is actually a story –
with a beginning, middle, and end. It first sets the scene (“this is who we
are”), then it sets the challenge (“here’s the situation in the market”), then
it drops the twist (“here’s what we’ve realised we can do”), and finally the
punchline (“thus our strategy is X”).

This whole line of reasoning is required to explain to anyone precisely what
your game is, not just the conclusion. It’s like a lawyer’s closing argument
in a courtroom trial. It seeks to _persuade_ the reader that the arrived at
conclusion is correct. It seeks to win hearts and minds.

Short of making a movie about the strategy, nothing will do this better than a
crisp piece of writing, since unlike a table or framework it has that all
important narrative flow.

**3 – It makes it repeatable by actual humans**

As I mentioned above, what we’re going for here is really nothing more than
the way you’d explain the strategy to someone verbally, but written down. This
means not only that it will be structured in the most human manner possible
(since we are verbal creatures) – but it also means that you give others the
gift of being able to talk about it too.

When someone has internalised the argument, there will be no quibbling over
precise wording, or mindless repetition of phrases they don’t really
understand. Instead they’ll be able to explain things in their own way – just
as you and I can have a stab at explaining the strategy of Apple or Amazon,
even though we’ve never actually seen their mythical “strategic decks”.

Generalised understanding is the gold standard we’re looking for here – not
rote memorisation.

That then is the crux of it. Any good strategy will lend itself to being
written as a narrative on a single page of A4, and if you can’t do that, well,
then I’d question the strategy not the medium.

Still, all that being said, I appreciate that this may be a little bit too
free wheeling for some, so there is a modicum of structure you can overlay on
this to make things a bit more manageable.

Personally I normally break it down into something like the following:

_(Please note that these sections are only indicative, and you should feel
free to change them based on what feels write when you’re writing it out)_

**Background**

A little intro the the company, its current state in the market, and what it
would like to do.

**Strategy argument**

The compelling mini-essay laying out how the business plans to deliver
surprising new value to its consumers, and why this will work.

There really is no structure to this segment, but the “flavour” will be
something like:

“The thing about this category is [X]. But this doesn’t really work because of
[Y]. Fortunately however our brand is the only one who can do [Z]. If we were
to do [Z] in [Q] manner, then it would completely change [Y]. Therefore our
strategy is to [P].”

_Seriously_ do not actually try and fill in these random letters. I’m just
giving you an idea of what an argument sounds like. All actual ones will need
to be written from scratch.

**Strategy summary**

At the close of your argument, you will probably want to have “the strategy”
articulated simply as a sentence. The [P] I put in the example above. There’s
no trick to this, just make it as plain spoken and clear as possible.

What I also like to do is to give the strategy a jazzy name so people can
refer to it in a shorthand manner when talking internally – e.g. “The Botox
Strategy”, or “Premium Junk”, or whatever. This is the only time you should be
getting fancy with copy here.

**Delivery**

Finally you’ll want a section outlining, in broad brush strokes, how you
intend to deliver on this. You may want to break this into sub sections, such
as “product” and “brand”, where you detail the elements of these things which
answer the strategy. These might be attributes that already exist within the
business, or things you intend to add. Either way, they are the “proof points”
that you’re really actually doing this thing.

___

So there you have it. A nice crisp little document which does all the heavy
lifting, and makes everyone’s life a hell of a lot easier.

It’s not much to look at. Nothing more than a glorified email really. But then
Jeff Bezos essentially strategised the whole of Amazon in a handful of well
written emails, so that’s nothing to sniff at.

Forget the jargon, just step forward, and make your case.
