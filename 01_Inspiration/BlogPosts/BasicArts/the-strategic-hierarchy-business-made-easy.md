As we all know, strategy is confusing.

If I tell people that I’m a [strategist](https://basicarts.org/newsletter/),
they typically respond in a similar manner as if I told them I’m a pixie – a
mixture of bafflement and scepticism. “I don’t really know what you mean, but
it sounds like bullshit anyway”.

This, frankly, is fair enough. It is a bit of a nonsense word, which is used
in a vastly broad variety of contexts, often completely erroneously.

It is for this reason that most businesses simply don’t do strategy, at least
not knowingly. Equally, it is for this reason that there isn’t really an
established strategy industry. A friend of mine, a very senior strategist
within a number of organisations, once sent me a market map of supposed
“strategy agencies”. What was remarkable about it was that it was divided into
four quadrants: research agencies, branding agencies, innovation agencies, and
the big consulting firms like McKinsey. Note that none of these categories are
pure _strategy_. Their work all overlaps with strategy, but none of them
specialise in the thing itself. This is because nobody’s really clear on what
strategy is, so nobody shops for it, and thus it’s very hard to sell (I should
know!). Thus almost all “strategy companies” become forced to root themselves
in an understood discipline like branding or research. This gives them access
to a market, and thus an _entry point_ through which to practice strategy, or
something vaguely like it.

Quite interesting I think – and probably the main reason why I have not yet
met anyone else who does precisely what I do, at least not in the same
capacity.

At any rate, all this is a shame, because the absence of strategy is what
leads pretty much all businesses to being somewhat muddled and directionless.
I dare say if you were to undertake an analysis of the most common problems
afflicting brands across all industries, number one would be something like
“lack of focus” or “messiness” of some description.

This messiness in turn is what I think makes business difficult. It can feel
like a tangled knot; a confusing headache, and cause of sleepless nights.

Here I want to outline a very basic idea that can go a long way to solving
that – even without needing to get a clear handle on strategy: the strategic
hierarchy. It’s something I’ve mentioned in passing a couple of times
recently, but have never dug into, so let’s do the here.

The strategic hierarchy presents three elements that, when taken together as a
unit, represent the entirety of any business’ customer-facing reality. The
best [advice for brands](https://basicarts.org/fit-in-to-stand-out/) that I
can offer is simply to address each one, in turn, ensure they align with each
other, and you will be operating under a far greater degree of clarity than
pretty much any other brand.

They are:

**1 – Value proposition**  
The value you deliver to the market

**2 – Delivery**  
The way you deliver that value

**3 – Branding**  
The way you communicate that value

As you can see it’s embarrassingly basic, and yet also pretty complete. You
can probably also see how in spite of its basicness, it’s not something many
people really have a handle on; preferring instead to overcomplicate things.

For one thing, most businesses never manage to nail down a strong value
proposition. I won’t dig into this at all here, because we’ve discussed it in
many different ways before, but sufficed to say this is the thing your
customers are paying for. The thing you are doing which people are prepared to
exchange for cash. It can come in a great many different “flavours”, from raw
functionality to complex social signalling, but it needs to exist if you want
to get paid – and ideally you need to have a strong grasp of it. All
successful businesses have one (they wound’t be successful without it) – but
not many have it clearly defined or understood.

**Without this first element, the model is useless, since the other two are
wholly dependent on it.**

Delivery is naturally how you give people that value you promise. The actual
practical elements of your product or service which make it happen. It goes
without saying that you should put a huge amount of energy into maximising
this, because it’s the whole point of your operation, and where you create
meaningful differentiation.

And then finally brand (by which I simply mean “presentation”, because
strictly speaking these three things together add up to your _true_ brand) is
how you communicate that value. How you let people know, in an eye catching
manner, what it is you actually do.

This last one I’ve found often catches people off guard. It’s a far more
simplistic description of branding than they’re used to, but if we’re honest,
it’s really all there is to it. Your business does something of value, and you
need to tell people about it in a way they care about and understand. If
they’re into it, then they’ll pay you for it. Not rocket science right?

Although there is a _huge_ amount of complexity buried in each one of these
elements, that complexity isn’t necessarily what most brands have an issue
with. Instead they have an issue with the high level ordering of these
complexities (seeing the wood for the trees) – and that is what the strategic
hierarchy is designed to address.

The value you deliver, the way you deliver it, the way you communicate it.
This is the scaffolding on which your businesses – every business – hangs. The
strategic hierarchy.

Think like that, and it all becomes way easier.
