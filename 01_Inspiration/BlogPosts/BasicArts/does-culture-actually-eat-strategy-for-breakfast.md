Now on with the business at hand…

___

They say that “culture eats strategy for breakfast”.

This is a little ditty most of us have probably heard, and on the face of it
there’s much to agree with there. The reasons it’s true include:

  1. You need a strong culture to execute a strategy. A great strategy in an organisation which is a cultural basket case would be like the proverbial throwing of seed onto stony ground. It will never take root and blossom into what it should be.
  2. Conversely, a strong culture can deliver results in the  _absence_ of strategy. As I’ve said many times before, strategy is not essential for success (as many big but dumb brands have proven), and this is partially because a strong but unstrategic culture can blindly grope its way to effective solutions through sheer graft and positivity.

Thus, because of the two above factors, if we were offered a choice of either
a good strategy OR a good culture, then yes, we would be wise to pick the
latter.

However…

As with so many truisms there is a secondary layer of subtlety sitting below
it, which most of us fail to notice thanks to the power of the statement. In
the case of “culture eating strategy for breakfast”, that subtlety is this:

**Strategy can (and should)_create_ culture.**

Yes, paradoxically whilst you need culture to  _execute_ strategy, you may
also find that you need strategy to  _create_ culture.

The reason for this this is simple. A proper strategy should have a
_unifying_ and  _galvanising_ effect on a business; two crucial factors in
culture creation.

  * It should give people a shared sense of direction, which binds them together into a cohesive and purposeful unit
  * And it should also be exciting and motivating, getting them “pumped up” and in a positive frame of mind

In the very best cases, the top level business strategy will also determine
the type of person who the business should hire, and how the business should
approach training, development, and general working policies (Patagonia,
Zappos, and Netflix are all famous examples of this).

Don’t get me wrong, great cultures can emerge organically, in the absence of
strategy (although we might say that such cultures are inherently fragile if
there’s no deliberateness about them). However the strongest situation to be
in is where the culture is a  _reflection_ of the strategy. Where it falls out
of it.

You see, when things are properly ordered there is nothing above strategy in a
business –  _nothing_ – not even culture. It is the  _logos_ , if you like.
The word, the thought, the idea, that precedes action and matter.

This doesn’t mean you can’t post-rationalise the strategy. Indeed I’d say most
good strategies are post-rationalised to some extent. It just means that all
things must come into line beneath it.

Consequently, if you’ve ever found yourself in a “good strategy / bad culture”
scenario, then I’d be inclined to question whether the strategy was, in fact,
“good”.

Because if we’re being technical about it, that situation shouldn’t ever
really exist. Culture should only be able to eat  _bad_ strategy for
breakfast. Good strategy, far from being eaten by culture, should nurture it.
