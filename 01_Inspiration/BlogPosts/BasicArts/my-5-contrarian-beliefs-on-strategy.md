If I could select one single idea from my body of work which I think is the
most powerful and transformative it would be this:

**The importance of disagreeing with your competitors.**

If you’ve been following my stuff for a while you’ll know all about this. The
point is that it’s not enough to simply be _different_ from your competitors –
different can be copied, and you can kid yourself that you’re different when
you’re really not – no, you must also be also be _contrarian_.

Contrarianism – difference built on disagreement – is hard to copy, and hard
to fake, and therefore is much more strategically robust than other
approaches.

So that’s the basic idea. All very nice. But of course, it begs the question:

**How am I, Alex Smith, contrarian?**

Where do I disagree with my competitors? Do I follow my own advice? Do I even
listen to my own schtick? Am I, in fact, a total charlatan?

OK, maybe that last one is a bit harsh, but still I thought that laying out my
“contrarian beliefs” in a newsletter might be useful for two reasons:

  1. Because it might teach you some new stuff about strategy, as I always try to do
  2. But moreover it will give you an example of the contrarian value approach _in action_

You see one slight issue with the examples that I normally use for this (e.g.
Southwest Airlines, Nintendo, Tesla, etc.) is that they weren’t necessarily
being contrarian on purpose. Their strategies certainly tapped into this
power, but I’m not sure they followed this _process_ to get there.

I, on the other hand, did, so perhaps it’d be helpful to see my thinking.

(Or not, let’s see).

So without further ado here are my 5 contrarian takes on the discipline which
I believe (somewhat) separate me from other “strategy consultants”, and which
inform the wider strategy of Basic Arts.

## 1\. Being right is overrated

For understandable reasons, the strategy world is highly motivated by coming
up with “correct” solutions to problems. I of course agree, that would be
nice, but actually I don’t think it’s all that important.

This is because you have _no way_ of knowing how a strategy is going to
perform before it’s actually executed in the world, and then, even if it
“works”, you can’t even be sure that it’s the strategy that’s “working”, or
some other random unpredictable factor you never intended!

Considering all that, why sweat the “rightness” when in reality you have no
way of ensuring it?

Instead get yourself to a point of:

  * Confidence
  * Excitement
  * And action-readiness

…all far more important and controllable factors, and then let fate handle the
rest.

## 2\. Strategy is 50% what to do, and 50% motivation to do it

Look, we all know that the purpose of a strategy is to tell you what to do.
That’s obvious. But it’s not the _only_ purpose of a strategy – the other
purpose is to act as a _motivational tool_ that inspires action.

I noticed recently that the world’s most famous “motivational speaker”, Tony
Robbins, actually refers to himself as a “strategist”, and in fact I think
that’s very apt. Because triggering massive action is the name of the game
here, not simply directing that action.

After all, what’s the point of a great strategy nobody actually does?

You need to inspire first, and direct second – but most of the industry
doesn’t seem to take the first part of that equation seriously.

## 3\. The more informal the process, the bigger the insights

I recently wrote that I see my role as injecting a “medicinal dose of
unprofessionalism” into my clients’ businesses, and I stand by that. This is
because the conditions that support good day-to-day operations of an
organisation (i.e. professionalism) do not provoke good strategy.

For that, you have to enter a different space – both physically and
psychologically.

This means humour, controversy, candour, time wasting, drinking, smoking,
relaxing, bonding, moving, and all manner of other ways to provoke penetrating
and unpredictable thought.

Admittedly I think that most of my competitors would nominally agree with this
one, but then again I haven’t often (or indeed _ever_) seen it actually
practiced, so I’m not so sure.

## 4\. Good ideas are self-evident

Connected somewhat to the first belief, I generally don’t believe you have to
do much checking or testing of a great strategy when it emerges.

You just know it because such strategies tend to _insist_ upon themselves.
They leave you with no choice, and make all other options redundant or
idiotic.

Part of the reason for this is because great strategies are those which are
simultaneously _obvious_ , but also have never been thought of before. That’s
the killer combo.

That obviousness will make a mockery of “testing” – like testing whether the
sky is indeed blue or if bears do indeed shit in the woods.

If you haven’t reached that point? Well, then you probably need to keep
looking.

## 5\. It can be really _really_ quick

I charge value-based fees so I’m free to say what everyone knows to be true,
but few are willing to admit: that this process can be rapid. I mean like _a
couple of hours_ rapid.

Of course my full projects don’t only last a couple of hours, they’re totally
open ended so there’s time for me to learn what I need to learn, to finesse
things, and to take the business with me. But the bit that _counts_? That’s
often just a moment, and not even a particularly hard-won moment at that.

In fairness most consultants like me also refuse to bill by the hour, since it
is such a colossally moronic moral hazard for this kind of work. So there’s
nothing contrarian about that. However taking the next logical step and
confessing that a project might not end up being a big undertaking… well,
that’s a different matter, because it can devalue the work.

But, in my view, the _real_ work of strategy is nothing less than embracing
the truth. And this is the truth, so I’ll admit it.

Now, I’m sure that many of my readers who are doing a similar thing to me will
be violently agreeing with all these points, so in that respect maybe they
aren’t contrarian at all.

However, from the point of view of the _market_ (the only POV that counts), it
sure doesn’t appear that way, and so the game still works.

Perception is reality, after all.

Notice also – _crucially_ – that these beliefs are not necessarily very
flattering to me. They make me look somewhat lazy, sloppy, risky, unserious,
and expensive.

**But that is the point.**

It is only contrarian if it _costs_ you something – if there is a legitimate
alternative point of view. All criticisms of these points are ENTIRELY
JUSTIFIED. I am not “right” about any of these things, I am exposing myself to
vulnerability in one area in order to open up opportunity in another.

If the beliefs don’t make you look bad to some eyes?

Then they are meaningless.

So, how about you? What makes you look bad?
