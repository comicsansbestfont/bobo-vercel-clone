Tis the season for ad agencies to cast [cynical
glances](https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/john-lewis-ad-formula-become-
tired/1449989?utm_medium=EMAIL&utm_campaign=eNews%20Bulletin&utm_source=20171120&utm_content=Campaign%20Creativity%20\(14\)::www_campaignlive_co_uk_article&email_hash=)
towards the latest festive offering from John Lewis. And one can understand
why.

In a purely creative sense, there really does seem to be a case of diminishing
returns here. A full, what, six years on from the first ad that really hit the
right notes – the one with the kid waiting not to _receive_ gifts from his
parents, but to _give_ to them instead (*sob*) – it does feel a bit like we’re
watching a washed-up old rock band just repeating the same crowd-pleasing
formula slightly less artfully each time, to gradually dwindling audiences.

Except that’s only half right. Whilst the work no longer feels fresh, that
doesn’t mean that the audiences are dwindling. In fact quite the opposite.

Last year’s (in my opinion) lacklustre offering with Buster the Boxer was
their biggest commercial success to date, making the superior original look
like a commercial pygmy in comparison. The trend seems to be continuing this
year, with no let up in the torrent of free publicity and goodwill being shown
by non-advertising types to Moz the Monster (alliteration is clearly a new
“thing” they’re trying), so one would imagine that the retailer will be
looking back on a similar success come January.

So how is it that this band, with only a couple of its original lineup still
intact, arthritic fingers shuddering over their instruments, is somehow
managing to shift more records and fill bigger arenas than they did in even
their glorious heyday? Such an effect wouldn’t be possible with any other
advertising campaign, so what gives here?

Well, apologies to all the cynics out there, but it really does come down to
the magic of Christmas.

Think about it like this. Does anyone ever ask if Christmas trees have become
a bit tired? Or Santa? Or mince pies? Or mulled wine? Or Christmas lights?
Does anyone ever question the originality or creative integrity of these
concepts? Does anyone ever ask why we don’t “freshen up” Christmas?

OK, I’m sure there are some people out there who do feel like that, but I
think we can agree they’d get a pretty short shrift from the general public.
And that’s because one of the central tenants of Christmas is the pleasure of
repetition. It’s so beloved and cherished precisely _because_ it never
changes.

No matter what kinds of craziness are going on in the world at large, there
comes a point, once per year, where everything pauses, and we get a sense that
everything is OK, everything is where it “should” be.

You can probably recognise this phenomenon in your own approach to Christmas.
Don’t you do certain things in certain ways just “because that’s the way it’s
_meant_ to be”? That’s the way it’s always been done? Woe betide anyone who
suggests you have a ham rather than a turkey on the 25th. Or who says let’s
open our presents on Christmas Eve this time. Or who tries to prevent you
putting out the tatty decorations you’ve been using since 1982. Without all
this stuff, it’s just “not Christmas”.

The great triumph of the John Lewis Christmas campaigns lie not in their
creativity, and certainly not their originality. No, they’ve achieved
something far far greater than that. They have become a Christmas trope in
their own right. You have your carol singers, your mince pies, your Queen’s
speech, and yes, your John Lewis ad. The public have added it to their arsenal
of traditions, and because of that you mess with it _at your absolute peril_.

If any too-clever-by-half creatives or put-their-own-stamp-on-things marketing
directors ever get hold of that account, and don’t understand what they have
on their hands then John Lewis will take a smacking. People now demand the
unabashed sentimentality, the rearrangement of a classic song, the triteness
of the whole affair; all because it makes them feel like Christmas. And thus,
guess what, John Lewis makes them feel like Christmas too. There are many
people who do all their Christmas shopping there for this very reason, because
a trip to John Lewis is a festive occasion – and this is purely a result of
repetition, not creative bravery.

Just as we are meant to put aside our petty differences at this time of year,
so too should we put aside our “marketing best practices”. Because Christmas –
or more specifically the marketing of Christmas – is bigger than that. In the
new year we can all return to wringing our hands about the imperilled state of
the advertising industry, funnelling cash down digital black holes, and
pinning all our hopes on drones or whatever it is in that moment… but for now
let’s cherish the one time of year when what advertisers do, undoubtedly, and
miraculously, works; when a blockbuster 60 second TV spot unities the nation.

If that doesn’t prove Christmas is magic, I don’t know what does.
