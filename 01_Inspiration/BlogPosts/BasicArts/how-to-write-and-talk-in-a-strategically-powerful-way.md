Pretty much every “strategy” I see looks something like this:

Whether or not the example in this image is “trying” to be a strategy, the
point still stands – the discipline, and indeed business in general, is
polluted by a style of communication that actually _obscures_ meaning rather
than revealing it.

I think we massively underestimate the importance of communication _style_ in
business, because when you think about it it’s the lynchpin that ties
everything together.

  * It’s what aligns your team
  * It’s what connects you with customers
  * It’s what structures your thinking

If you can’t string words together in a powerful way, all of that falls apart,
and thus the business falls apart too.

What do I mean by powerful?

  * Clear
  * Specific
  * Exciting
  * And _content rich_

The first three of these are self explanatory, but the last one is especially
important, because most business communication lacks “information density” –
i.e. the amount of meaningful info per word is extremely low, as per the ad
above.

I believe that if you fix these things, it has the capacity to 5x everything
you do, including the weight of your own thought. So I’d be remiss if I didn’t
spend a bit of time discussing how.

_It’s one of those hidden parts of strategy which is actually more important
than the strategy itself._

Here, then, are my top 3 tips on how to talk and write in a way that makes
things happen.

## I. Ditch the value judgements

This is one of my old chestnuts, and it bears repeating:

**Remove all value judgement words from your writing.**

This means anything like “good”, “best”, “better”, “awesome”, “leading”, etc.
The problem with such words is neatly summarised in the ad, but to expand on
it a little the issue with value judgements is that they are in the _eye of
the beholder_ , not the speaker. They are _responses_ to information rather
than information itself.

Don’t tell me you’re “disruptive”. Instead just tell me precisely _what_
you’re doing, and if it’s true I’ll respond by saying “wow, that’s
disruptive!”. It’s the actual _content_ that counts, not the judgement we
attach to that content.

Too often people seem to think that they can “shortcut” this process by simply
saying “this thing is industry leading” or “revolutionary” or whatever without
actually detailing why that is. But nobody falls for this, so just cut these
terms from your vocabulary and hold yourself to higher account.

## II. Ditch the terminology

  * Don’t say “strategy”.
  * Say “the value we’re giving to people they can’t get elsewhere”.

…

  * Don’t say “positioning”.
  * Say “the stuff we’re comparing ourselves to”.

…

  * Don’t say “vision”.
  * Say “the thing we want to happen”.

In short, don’t rely on technical terms to do your communicating for you –
instead just _say what you mean_.

The reason this is so important is because terms like these have loose
meanings that vary from person to person. This means when you use them,
everyone hears something different.

Not only that, people often use “jargon” like this when they don’t really know
what they’re saying. They use technical language as a sort of “shield”, to get
people nodding along even when nothing of value is being said; so a secondary
benefit of avoiding them is to _expose yourself_.

Let me tell you, with the exception of “strategy” which alas is a necessary
evil, I have built my entire career without ever using any words like these.
Honestly, I don’t even really know what they mean! And that’s been super
powerful as it’s meant I’ve always had to be explicit – which is exactly what
works.

## III. Don’t confuse simplicity for clarity

This is a super subtle one, so listen up:

**Clarity and simplicity are not the same thing.**

In fact they are often the opposite. Often when people try to be simple in
their communications, they strip out “soft” elements which are actually
extremely useful in fully landing the meaning of what they’re saying .

Many people’s idea of simplicity is to be brief, dry, and inhuman – which can
actually be quite hard to grasp. By contrast clarity is often best served by
communicating in a way that is rich and colourful; making full use of
metaphor, humour, and even poetry (to an extent).

For example, at the moment I’m working on a project where we have leant
heavily on this analogy:

“Don’t build a Rolls-Royce when all you really need is a bicycle”.

The meaning of this is clear, and can be grasped instantly and intuitively,
much more so than if I was to “simplify” it to something like:

“Don’t over-engineer your product”.

This more straightforward phrasing is, I would suggest, far less clear, as it
lacks traction in our brains. It skims off the surface, and I’ve forgotten it
as soon as I’ve read it. That is weak communication.

Providing you don’t break the first commandment above (skipping the value
judgements), being more rich and flowery in your writing and speech is _good_.
It makes stuff stick.

___

Probably you could bucket all of the above under one simple command:

**Stop being so professional.**

For whatever reason, professionalism really weakens the impact of your words,
probably because its primary purpose is standardisation.

But we aren’t trying to be standard.

We’re trying to stand _out_.

And your words are the root of how you’re gonna do that, so don’t neglect
them.
