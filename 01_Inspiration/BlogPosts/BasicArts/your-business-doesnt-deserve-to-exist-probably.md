Does your company deserve to exist? “Of course!” I hear you answer. But does
it really. Because these days most don’t.

There are exceptions of course. That busy little coffee place down the road
from you? They deserve to exist. They’ve answered a need. They’ve set up shop
in a specific locale where no one else was operating before, people wanted
them, and now they’re ticking along nicely.

Apple too. They also deserve to exist. They didn’t really answer any needs of
course – no one was crying out for colourful computers, closed music
platforms, or tablets – they created them. As Steve Jobs delighted in
reminding us, they were ahead of consumers, not behind.

Still, behind or ahead, both Apple and the local coffee shop are exactly what
businesses should be: intrinsically worthwhile, enriching the world around
them.

Unfortunately, this isn’t how most brands operate. Most brands are founded
neither from a specific vision, nor from a desire to answer a need or a
problem. Instead they arise from an exploitative mindset; trying to squeeze a
profit from a market that’s already amply served.

Punters, of course, sense this. In fact, the famous 2014 study by Havas
showing that the public wouldn’t care if 73% of brands ceased to exist is
probably a fair estimate of the proportion of brands that are exploitative
versus worthwhile.

This would be fine if they could just be avoided, but since they tend to play
in highly competitive markets (the cost of unoriginality, alas), they also
tend to advertise. Heavily.

Advertising, which should be a wonderful service informing you of things that
will enrich your life, has become a battleground where pointless brands fight
over Orwellian manipulations like “share of mind”, and try to shave percentage
points of equity from their identikit competitors. Agency creativity,
something that we instinctively cherish, is in fact often nothing more than a
crutch for brands who can’t sell themselves on merit alone.

Little wonder that 84% of millennials “don’t trust advertising”. The more
sophisticated it becomes, the more worthless the underlying brand must be.

So what about your brand? Which side of the divide do you sit on?

Here’s a simple test. If you were to make an ad that plainly stated who you
are and what you do, with no embellishment or grandstanding, would it be
enough to make people buy you?

If the answer is yes, then no doubt you’re doing just fine. You might have a
unique product like Twitter, or an expansive vision like Red Bull. You may be
synonymous with your whole category like Coke, or you may just be in the right
place with the right service like the local coffee shop. One way or another
though, you’re doing good.

But if you have any hesitation then welcome to the annoying 73%. You’re set
for an uphill struggle with today’s consumer, who know a great authentic brand
when they see one – and you’re not it.

Still, it’s not all doom and gloom, you do have options. Your first option is
to throw money at the issue. If you’re lucky your brand may be the child of a
global mega-corp, who have pretty solid track records getting brands to fly by
brute force alone. The problem with this approach however, is that if you’re
successful you essentially degrade the market. You have the capacity to sink
other better brands who simply don’t have the arm twisting power at your
disposal. So for the sake of everyone else, this approach isn’t recommended.

Your second option is much better. Simply make your business worthwhile.

This may sound frightfully ambitious – the business is what it is right? – but
it’s actually no more complex than taking some of your advertising budget and
creativity, flipping it around, and applying it inwards. Rather than creating
campaigns, create tweaks and builds to your core business which help
distinguish it from competitors fundamentally and intrinsically; and which in
turn make it interesting and worthwhile.

This might mean expanding the remit of what your business does beyond your
core product, but in line with your brand strategy. Think about when Airbnb
started connecting people to have dinner together, or when Pedigree in New
Zealand created a platform to help find lost dogs. These initiatives may have
simply been funded by marketing, but to the outside world they appeared
integral.

It also might mean tweaking your existing processes. Think about Hiut Denim,
who highlight their craftsmanship by having every pair of jeans they produce
signed by the person who made them.

This broad approach is starting to crystallise into a new advertising
discipline called “basic”. Its arrival is timely, as it’s becoming plain to
see that the advertising battleground of the future is not on TV, or on
social, or on mobile – it’s in the fabric and behaviours of companies
themselves. Those who are interesting and worthwhile will thrive; those who
aren’t will gradually, and expensively, die. Make sure you’re on the right
side of the divide.
