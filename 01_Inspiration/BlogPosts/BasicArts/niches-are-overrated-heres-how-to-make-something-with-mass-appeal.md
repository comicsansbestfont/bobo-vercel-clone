I’m going to keep this one relatively brief.

I see a lot of advice out there celebrating the idea of narrowing down your
business to a very specific customer, with a very specific problem. “Riches in
the niches” and all that.

I call this “Linear Strategy”, because intuitively it makes sense:

**Step 1: Identify customer problem**  
**Step 2: Create innovation**

And I see why people do it. If you have a “perfect fit” with a given customer
selling to them is easier.

But I also think it’s wrong.

There are many reasons for this, but for now let’s just focus on the simple
one: this approach creates small businesses, with limited appeal. If you do
something highly specific, your use cases are narrow, and your growth will be
constrained to how many of them you can find.

This is not what Coke does.  
This is not what IKEA does.  
This is not what Salesforce does.  
This is not what Shopify does.  
This is not what Ford does.

…and it’s also not what the very best SMEs do either, frankly.

All of these businesses solve _multiple_ problems, for _multiple_ types of
customer. If you grabbed two random Shopify customers, or IKEA customers,
chances are you would find them to be very different.

You might think “oh well that’s just because they’re big mass brands, and most
companies aren’t like that”. But I disagree. I think it’s because they have a
different fundamental approach to strategy, an alternative to Linear Strategy
which I call “ _Reverse_ Strategy”.

It’s called reverse because it’s literally the same process backwards:

**Step 1: Create innovation.**  
**Step 2: Identify customer problems**

You start with an innovation, and then you find customer problems it might
solve.

Now note the one key difference here (other than the order): in Reverse
Strategy I said customer _problems_ – plural – not customer _problem_ –
singular. And this is the key.

When you start with a broad form of innovation you will find that there are
_many_ different types of people and types of problem you can apply it to –
not just one. You may choose one as your primary for marketing purposes, but
you will quickly discover your appeal runs much broader than that.

Silly little example, but for myself I _explicitly_ don’t target fellow
strategists with anything I do – and yet they come anyway. They are a
secondary customer base for me who are attracted by the same innovation as
founders, but driven by a different motivation.

Now you may be wondering: “Sure Alex, that’s fine, but how can you come up
with an innovation out of the blue without a targeted purpose like a customer
problem?”.

And I’d say there are two ways:

  1. **Lean into your natural difference.** You are already somewhat different from the status quo in your category, in ways that you didn’t fully intend – so what would happen if you leant into this? What would happen if you did it 10x more than you currently are? Push this far enough and this will generate natural innovation and difference for you, which you can apply to customer problems.
  2. **Fix industry problems, not customer problems.** Here you take a 10,000ft view of your industry, and ask what is _wrong_ with it, or what’s _missing_ from it? What is something clear and coherent that could be offered that might provide an alternative? Essentially you just say, “everything in this industry is like X, but what if it was like Y?”…and then explore the implications.

You don’t need a moaning customer to find opportunities. You can just make
them up!

This then is how you create “big ideas”, not just trivial incremental ideas
which tinker around the edges, like most businesses have.

Forget the ideal customer. Start thinking about the ideal _customers_.
