Next Sunday, I’m turning 40.

And it feels like a pretty significant one, to tell the truth. Not just
because it’s a landmark birthday, but because for many people it marks an
inflection point:

  * Is this when life _ends_?
  * Or is this when life _starts_?

Both of these probably sound pretty hyperbolic, but hear me out.

For many people life “ends” at this point because it is roughly the moment
where you realise that _this is your life_ , for better or worse.

When you’re 23, you have no idea what things will be like in 10 years’ time.
You don’t know who you’ll be with, where you’ll be living, what job you’ll be
doing – it’s all still up for grabs. This is not true at 40. Probably you’ll
be married. Maybe with kids. Settled in a particular location. And deep into a
career that it’s too late to back out of.

This is it.

This is you.

And it’s that sense of finality that makes it feel like an “ending”. There’s
nothing left to do now but wile away the years. The feeling of upward and
forward trajectory has waned. They mystery is gone.

_(Some of you might scoff at this but I’ve literally had people my age tell me
that they’ve hit all the milestones they were expecting to hit, and now think
there’s nothing left to do)_

On the other side, you have Carl Jung.

He famously said “life really does begin at 40 – until then, you’re just doing
research”. The idea here is that 0 – 40 were the low stakes years, where you
were simply practicing for the _true_ life you can lead after you’ve come to
know yourself.

In other words, the journey starts now.

**What do you think? Is this the end or the start?**

Of course I know that you’ll all be furiously saying “the start!”, obviously.
Me too. What kind of loser would say “the end”?

But be careful.

It’s easy to side with Jung rhetorically, but the facts are not on his side.
Just wishing this does not make it so. The truth is that for most of us that
feeling of upward trajectory _does_ stop at this time.

Unless you do this one thing:

**Set yourself an impossible challenge.**

You see your pre-40 momentum and optimism comes from the fact that society
sets certain “default challenges’ for you. Find a spouse, climb the career
ladder, buy a house, etc.

You don’t need any imagination to strive for these things because they’re
basically pre-installed.

The problem comes when you tick off these things (or reject them), and realise
you have nothing left. The default challenges are complete, and nobody is
going to set you another one.

The only escape therefore, is to create one for yourself.

And this is where Jung is right. You now have 40 years of experience to help
you choose what that challenge should be.

The specifics of it are not important. All that matters is that:

  * It suits you
  * It excites you
  * And it is _far_ beyond you

That last one is key. Because it is that one that will force you to _continue_
growing, and _continue_ gambling, and _continue_ exploring, at precisely the
moment where it becomes easy to stop doing those things.

Whatever you choose, you do not need to achieve it. You probably never will.
That’s not the point.

The point is simply to stay in the game, and to continue experiencing the
vitality and mystery that younger people take for granted.

_“OK that’s all very nice Alex, but what the hell does this have to do with
strategy?”_

I will tell you.

**This is the**** _true_****purpose of strategy.**

Whether for a business or yourself, it is _not_ about achieving such-and-such
a goal. Maybe you will, maybe you won’t. That’s in the hands of fate,
regardless of how clever you are. No, the true purpose is to give yourself an
_adventure while trying,_ and to fulfil the innate _telos_ of the human
animal; which is to create, to grow, and to strive.

Too much? Maybe.

I’ll admit, this is self-indulgent. But hey, it’s my birthday, so I’ll allow
it.

Normal service will resume next week, but I guess all this is to say thanks
for reading – and I’m just getting started.
