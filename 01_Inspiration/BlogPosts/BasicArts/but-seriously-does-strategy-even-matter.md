One of my concepts that long time readers will be familiar with is this:

**Strategy is _optional_.**

It really is. You don’t have to do it. Most successful people and businesses
don’t even bother – at least not consciously. They just hustle and experiment
and try, and get their rewards regardless. Generally we can say that “effort”
is a good substitute for strategy. Indeed I think you could even argue that
it’s _more_ reliable.

If you take two businesses, one of which relies on a clever and differentiated
play, while the other simply sweats and bleeds to try and force results, which
is more likely to make it?

Probably the latter, if I’m honest.

So, this begs the obvious question: why even bother?

I’m certainly not the first person to ask this. There are many entrepreneurial
types who scorn the “navel gazing” that strategy implies, and think it’s
better to “just get on with it”. And for sure I have a lot of sympathy with
this POV (_especially_ considering what most “strategy” is like).

And yet, somehow, strategy persists.

It remains influential, important and desirable in spite of its dubious
effectiveness. Why? Why should we follow the strategic path when other options
exist?

I think there are three key reasons, and here they are.

## I. Economic growth

OK, fine, most of us don’t make our decisions based on what is going to be
“better for the economy” as a whole, but I still think it’s an important
point. Strategy drives _growth_.

Why?

Because strategy is about the creation of _new_ value. New products, new
angles, new concepts, new solutions, new industries, new philosophies. Hustle
can’t do that. Hustle is about providing solutions to obvious problems (which
have probably already been solved), and trying to get yourself a slice of pre-
existing pie.

Strategy is about creating your own pie – which by definition means growth,
both economically and culturally.

It’s important to remember that most great strategic businesses don’t answer
needs, but create them. Quite honestly the world would be just fine without
most of the fruits of strategy. There is ZERO reason why brands like Liquid
Death, or Who Gives a Crap, or 5 Hour Energy, or Harley Davidson should even
exist. If they hadn’t been made, there wouldn’t be another brand in their
place – there’d simply be a vacuum. Growth that never happened.

Of course there’s another side to this argument – the driving of pointless
consumption – but hey, for better or worse that’s the edifice we’ve built our
entire civilisation on, so I guess you’ve got the choice between “strategy”
and “societal collapse”, and you’ve gotta take your pick!

## II. Fat profits

Effort-based businesses can be big. And they can be successful. But what they
_can’t_ be is unusually profitable. (Unless they get very lucky).

This is because profit comes from leverage that separates a business from the
competitive dogfight – the entire purpose of strategy of course. The famous
stat I always refer back to is the moment in time when the iPhone had 15%
market share of the smartphone market, but 79% profit share. This insane
imbalance occurred simply because (rightly or wrongly) iPhone customers did
not consider other options. This basically meant they could charge more, and
spend less on customer acquisition.

Voilá! Strategy in action.

Now by comparison HTC are, I’m sure, a very successful and very big company.
But (as far as I know), they aren’t especially strategic so they simply make
“ordinary” profits. I’m sure their big cheeses don’t have holes in their
shoes, but still, it’s not quite as enticing is it?

So basically, if you’re greedy, and want to get rewards that _outstrip_ the
effort you put in (rather than simply being _commensurate_ with it), then,
well, strategy’s your game.

## III. The thrill of adventure

Perhaps most compelling however is this: the strategic path is more fun.

In my view it aligns with our “telos” as human beings; we want to experience
the electricity of an insight, and the rush of taking a big charismatic
gamble. We want to explore and play and create. We want to be _expressive_ ,
and above all else strategy is an expressive discipline. We can (and must) put
ourselves into it.

Is our business a glorified widget, designed to “do a job” and little more?

Or is it our artwork, our masterpiece?

If you’re creating a business, you’re going to be spending a pretty serious
chunk of your life on it, so don’t you want it to have a touch of beauty and
dare I say _glory_? And even if you’re an employee, do you simply want to be a
cog in the machine; a unit of corporate cattle – or do you want to make a
move, and leave your mark?

I suppose the answer depends somewhat on what else you have going on in your
life. Clearly there is nothing wrong with a job just being a job – this is not
the only source of meaning in life. It’s probably not even in the top 10.

But still, if you _have_ to do it, if you _must_ pour your energies into the
world of commerce, then you might as well make the most of it, and do it with
a sense of vitality, right?

That’s my opinion anyway.

___

Honestly I think that if we understand strategy in this way – as an _optional_
form of creative expression, rather than a bedrock necessity – then it will
encourage us to approach it in the right way.

We don’t need to take it so seriously, and hold onto it so tightly, and put so
much pressure on it. We can relax a bit, and take it in the spirit that (I
believe) it was always intended: the spirt of play and adventure.

Remember you’ll always have effort to fall back on. You have that safety net.
So trust it will catch you, and let go.
