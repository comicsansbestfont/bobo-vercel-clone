_Warning: this one gets a bit “deep”… but you might still get a kick out of
it, let’s see._

As many of you know, I never had any formal strategy training.

Heck, until fairly recently, I’d never even read a book about it. In fact I
think I had the misguided arrogance to set up a “strategy consultancy” without
having done so – a decision I now cringe at, but still, it worked out OK in
the end.

In light of this you may well wonder where I got my “knowledge” from. How I’m
able to keep on churning out all of this content, despite never having
_consumed_ any in the first place.

Well, there are three explanations, all a bit true:

  1. Real world experience
  2. Being good at bullshitting
  3. A hidden universal theory

The first two of these are pretty self-explanatory, but it’s actually the
third I want to speak about today. You see the fact is that rather than
learning all the formal “elements” of strategy from books, courses, and the
like, my approach was kind of the reverse:

**I _inferred_ these elements from one single _root_ idea**

I drew this root idea from other sources, but what’s amazing about it is that
the practical “strategic lessons” it teaches you correspond almost _exactly_
with classical strategy theory – the kind of stuff you’d read in HBR or learn
on an MBA course.

It’s just another way of accessing that material – and in some sense it’s more
powerful, since when you grasp it you can always refer back to it to “fill in
the blanks” of your understanding.

So what is this magical theory of which I speak?

Let’s get into it.

## The theory of “systemic fit”

The underlying idea that informs all strategic principles is not to be found
in business at all, but rather in nature.

In nature we can see that every discrete thing that exists is simultaneously a
“whole”, made up of smaller things, and also a “part” of a larger thing. For
instance.

An atom is part of a cell.  
A cell is part of an organ.  
An organ is part of a body.  
A body is part of an ecosystem.  
Etc.

See what I mean? A kind of endless stack, up and down.

Now, the thing about each one of these things (each whole/part) is that they
are not independent. In fact they are intensely _interdependent_ – they each
have jobs, and their job is defined by the needs of the larger whole of which
they are a part, _and their relationship to the other parts around them_.

For example a liver has to work as part of a “team” with the other things at
its level (i.e. other organs, the heart, the stomach, etc.), in order to serve
the thing above it, a body (let’s say a deer for sake of illustration). The
deer in turn has to behave in a certain way in “partnership” with other
species serve the ecosystem of which it is a part. It has to eat grass, poop,
and occasionally be eaten by wolves etc.

What happens if something in this stack _doesn’t_ do what it’s supposed to do?

Well, it damages both itself, and the whole that it’s a part of. For example a
malfunctioning liver is liable to kill the body, and thus also itself and the
other organs around it.

But if it works in harmony with the other organs? Then the body will thrive,
and so too will it.

**So what the hell does this have to do with strategy?**

Well, these systemic relationships aren’t just the stuff of biology textbooks
– they are _universal_. This is simply how the dynamics of complex systems are
arranged, anywhere and everywhere; and it doesn’t matter whether that system
is natural, or man-made.

For example, you could replace the illustration I made above with the
following:

An employee is part of a team.  
A team is part of a division.  
A division is part of a company.  
A company is part of a market.

All the same dynamics apply – with the role of each piece being determined by
the needs of the whole above it.

Now if you buy this line of thinking, it has some very interesting
implications, especially for strategy. You see what this says is that
companies and their competitors are not in _opposition_ , but are actually in
_collaboration_ for the purposes of creating a healthy market. And not only
that, their respective roles must be _complementary_ – in exactly the same way
that the liver, the heart, and the stomach are complementary within their
system.

Get the gist?

This immediately leads us to a whole bunch of practical strategy implications,
e.g.:

  * Businesses must be different from their competitors, and not “double up” in their functions, because this would be the equivalent of having “two livers”
  * Businesses must define their offers one the basis of balancing with competitors in order to create the most rounded and healthy market possible – i.e. the one with the optimal diverse blend of options for customers
  * If a business tries to “bulldoze” the market with capital and take share by brute force (e.g. like Casper mattresses did), it will not only damage the market and its competitors, but it will also damage itself

All of this is why I constantly refer to strategy as a yin-yang balancing act,
where the characteristics of each company, properly aligned, can even be
_beneficial_ to the others around it.

_(NB it’s worth noting that just like in a natural system everything is a
state of constant churn, so offers might go “extinct” over time just as
species do if they fail to adapt)_

Can you see then how all you ever really have to do, is serve these dynamics?

How if you are true to them, every decision will take you down the the path of
effective strategy – even if you know nothing about “strategy” per se?

The whole book _Blue Ocean Strategy_ , if you’ve read that, is simply a
retread of this logic – although the authors never refer to it. It’s the same
thing just shoved into business-speak form.

So too was [my TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBfUkMhZdQ) from a
few years ago – where I illustrated the same points but with various classic
strategy examples.

It all fits. It’s all so elegant.

Now look, I’m sure there are various edge cases where the model has to be
adapted. I’m not saying that every single important business-specific strategy
principle can be inferred from this.

But I do think it’s a pretty solid start.

And if you can zoom out far enough to see things this way, you’re unlikely to
ever go too far wrong.
