The most difficult (and often effective) strategy for any company to master is
this: changing nothing.

We all suffer from an almost irresistible urge to tinker. To be active. To
keep things fresh and interesting. Not to stand still. We’re told constantly
that innovation is the lifeblood of a business. So its understandable that, if
you’re running one, you would want to shake things up now and again.

However customers see things precisely the opposite way.

If you love a product or service, your one wish for it is to never change. It
represents a tiny portion of your life, one which – now that it’s settled –
you’re grateful to never have to think about ever again. It is this inertia,
this satisfaction with something as it is, that is the great driver of
loyalty. This little piece of my life is now sorted, and I’m happy to cruise
along with it indefinitely forever more.

Tinkering jeopardises that. It wakes customers up, and invites them to
question their relationship with the company. Is this what I really want?

The textbook example of this error was the disastrous launch of New Coke – a
Coca-Cola recipe change in 1985 that was so damaging that it was reversed in
the space of three months. Far from being an aberration however, New Coke
represents the tip of a very deep iceberg that spans all industries and
businesses.

We kid ourselves into thinking that we do this stuff for our customers, but
really we do it for ourselves. We live and breathe this business every day of
our lives, so of course get bored of it. But customers never get bored. They
value consistency and comfort above all else.

One of the most publicly visible examples of this pointless tinkering is
branding. It’s quite typical for normal companies to update this stuff every 3
or 4 years – generally because a new marketing director has arrived who want
to “put their stamp” on things.

But what is the one attribute shared by all the world’s most beloved and
iconic brands? Consistency. Rabid, relentless, consistency. Have the public
become bored with “Just do it”? Or “Red Bull gives you wings”? Or even “Have a
break, have a Kit-Kat”? I have no doubt that all these companies have had to
resist their fair share of smart-ass executives and agencies who thought it
was time to “freshen things up”. But it would make about as much sense as
freshening up Christmas. It is the unchanging nature of these things that
makes them work, not their novelty.

I only use branding because it’s an obvious example, but the principle applies
equally to all public facing parts of the business. Recently Nandos – the
gloriously consistent casual dining establishment – decided to remove sweet
potato wedges from their menu. Their reasoning? “We are always looking for
ways to give our menu a refresh and keep things interesting”. Interesting for
who exactly? Not these people:

But of course, the business employs many people in an innovation capacity, so
if you’re paying for them you’ve got to use them I suppose.

Now of course, if a business has problems, then it may well need to change
things in order to stop the rot. That’s reasonable. But in general never
underestimate the virtue of consistency, and the value of inertia. Because it
takes years to build. But only a moment to throw away.
