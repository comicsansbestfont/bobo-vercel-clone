OK, this title sounds ridiculous. But hear me out, and by the end of this
essay, I think I’ll have won you over.

First, here’s the issue:

**The modern world is boring.**

Now admittedly it’s many other things too. And many of those things might make
you happy to be living in the here and now, rather than say 300 years ago in
feudal France or something. But that doesn’t change the fact that it is,
indeed, _boring_.

In the past, the world was an open canvas. Merely leaving your village was an
invitation to mystery and danger – never mind venturing overseas, which was
like going to a different planet.

The world had no shortage of frontiers to explore – geographic, philosophic,
scientific – and to simply be alive was something of an adventure. Or at the
very least, adventure was yours if you wanted it.

But as time went by, we traded that all in.

For comfort.  
For safety.  
For convenience.  
For predictability.

For all manner of things which are perfectly reasonable and desirable in their
own right, but which nevertheless come at a price. The price of this
adventure, and a vital, thrilling life.

Billionaires now circumnavigate the world with balloons, and plot missions
into outer space in search of this human birthright, but for the rest of us,
it isn’t so easy.

There just aren’t many edges left to explore.

Our lives are templated. Our paths are set. The “answers” have been provided
for us. Just order your food, watch your Netflix, get on your Zoom calls, and
you’ll be fine.

That is the _deal_.

And for most of us, it’s a pretty good one.

But still, for some, there is a wistful yearning for something _more_. To
rediscover some of that risk and daring which used to be just how the human
experience _was_. Without it, we feel a sense of malaise. Disenchantment. Even
depression.

How can we inject some of this lost magic back into our lives?

The answer – at least in part – is with strategy.

Insane, I know. Not only does that not sound true, it sounds the _opposite_ of
true. For most people “strategy” intuitively means a form of control, and risk
mitigation. It represents all the stultifying forces which have shaped the
modern prison in the first place.

But that is wrong.

For strategy – as I hope _my_ readers at least will know – is not a way to
mitigate risk.

**Strategy is a way to increase risk.**

Strategy – whether applied to your life, your career, or your business – is a
process of stepping off the path that has been laid out for you, and forging a
new one. It is the process of making a big, audacious, unpredictable move, and
living with the consequences.

The non-strategic approach, by definition, is to follow the generic template.
And the strategic approach is to abandon it – for better or worse.

There is actually a term for this, coined by Michael Raynor, called “the
strategy paradox”. I’ve written about it before but it bears repeating – the
strategy paradox is that by adopting a strategy, you actually make it MORE
likely you’ll fail, rather than less.

It makes perfect sense when you think about it. Because strategy necessitates
taking a _risk_ , rolling the dice, you put yourself directly in harm’s way.

If you don’t want to fail, don’t do strategy! Instead follow the template. The
template works. It’s consistent. You’ll probably be fine. Mediocre, sure, but
fine. You won’t fail. That is the choice you’re offered – and there’s nothing
wrong with the more timid path.

What this all comes down to then is understanding this very peculiar (but
true), idea:

**Strategy is not about success.**  
**Strategy is about _glory_.**

You are not seeking comfort and prosperity when you make your move. You are
seeking that thing modernity has stolen from us: adventure. You are crafting a
new frontier in a world that’s run out of them. You are creating a distant
shore in your mind – a shore which you can only reach by acting with vitality,
bravery, and really truly _living_.

I know this is somewhat grandiose, and beyond the scope of, say, a strategy
textbook.

But honestly I think there’s a higher spiritual purpose to all this. We humans
need adventure. It’s our telos. It’s what we were made to pursue, just as bees
make honey, and birds somersault through waterfalls.

And if it won’t come to us? Well, we have to make our own.

A strategic business, is business as an adventure.  
A strategic career, is career as an adventure.  
A strategy life, is life as an adventure.

At least, that’s what I think.

So, don’t do it because it’s sensible. There are other more sensible ways to
live. Do it, instead, because it’s not.
