_Before getting into this week’s essay, I just to alert you to a new
undertaking of mine:_

**Concept testing on Linkedin.**

From now on I’m going to be doing one post a day on the platform where I’ll be
trying out new ideas and theories, having a chat about them, and then
potentially expanding on them more deeply here in the newsletter.

If any of you are on the platform and would like to receive and chat about
this stuff, then I’d love it if you gave me a follow / invited me to connect.
I’ll always respond thoughtfully to any questions / builds / challenges in the
comments – and over time hopefully we’ll get a nice little “talking shop”
going on over there.

[My profile is here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-m-h-smith-26182816/),
just go there, follow or connect, and hit the bell icon to get notified of new
posts.

Right, now on with the business of the day…

The world of expertise is built on one gigantic lie.

Business consultants, doctors, coaches, lawyers, chess grandmasters – you name
it and the lie is the same:

**That good decisions are made by rigorous analysis of the facts at hand.**

We have this idea that to solve a complex problem, as experts like these do on
a routine basis, the formula is always roughly the same. First gather the
data. Do your research, compiling all the solid objective information you can.
Second, analyse the data. Have a good hard think about what you’ve learned,
attempting to following it through to its logical conclusion. And then
finally, arrive at “the answer”.

This belief in a conscious, rational, systematic process to deliver results is
the driving force behind the popularity of trademarked “models” and
“proprietary technology” that many professionals (especially in the business
world) use to try and sell their wares. It’s why the medical industry is
increasingly systematising its diagnostic processes; input symptoms here,
output solution there. And it’s also why many people believe that sooner or
later AI will take over all these fields – since if results are simply a
matter of rigorous calculation, it stands to reason that a computer will
eventually do it better than a human being.

Too bad then that this universally accepted belief is (almost) complete
bullshit.

The truth is explained at (extraordinary) length by psychiatrist and
neurologist Iain McGilchrist in his two-volume tome [ _The Matter With
Things_](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Matter-Things-Brains-Delusions-
Unmaking/dp/1914568060) – a part of which I’m going to attempt to brutally
shorten and simplify for you here today.

In a nutshell what McGilchrist shows is that results in all fields of
expertise (including business strategy) are not driven by conscious analysis,
but are in fact almost wholly the result of  _unconscious_ intuition. In other
words, great experts don’t really “think” about their problems at all – they
more “glance” at them and then reach their conclusions instinctive “gut feel”.
These conclusions might be post-rationalised to explain why they might be
right, and to “sell” them to an outside audience, but the actual  _process_ by
which they’re arrived at is nothing like the linear one that the post-
rationalisation suggests.

So profound is this truth in fact, that not only is rational analysis and
research relatively unimportant, but it actually  _lowers_ the accuracy of
results when inserted into the process. In other words (to oversimplify
slightly) experts will arrive at  _worse_ conclusions if they’re forced to
think about the problem than if they just go with their gut.

How is all this possible? I’ll give you my crude interpretation, and then
illustrate it with an example from the book which I found pretty astonishing.

**In short the core idea is that the unconscious mind knows a hell of a lot
more than the conscious.**

Think about it like this. We can imagine reality as being comprised of an
“infinite” amount of information. When analysing a problem there aren’t only,
say, 5 pertinent “facts” (which is roughly the highest number our conscious
mind can process), or even a million, but rather a sort of fluid continuum of
stuff all of which is inter-related, and cannot be pulled apart or “reduced”
for conscious analysis. Therefore there are far more variables to any
situation than we can ever capture and think about it.

Now, couple this with the fact that of all the stuff our mind takes in, 99% is
unconscious and 1% is conscious. Our brain only makes us “aware” of a tiny
sliver of information it receives at any given moment in time. What that means
then is that we “know” far more than we  _know we know_. When a doctor
observes a patient, for example, they might be consciously aware of 10 “facts”
about them, but at the same time they are unconsciously aware of another 1,000
more.

As a result the unconscious mind is far better placed to accurately interpret
reality, since it bases its decisions on a far fuller picture than the
conscious mind does.

A powerful example of this can be found in the case of the “horse picker”
Franck Mourier. His job is to basically give his opinion on which horse is
likely to win a race, for the benefit of his clients who will then make their
bets accordingly – and he’s very good at it, consistently beating the odds.
What is amazing about his process however is not just that it’s intuitive, but
that when he’s given seemingly pertinent facts about the horses (e.g. who won
the last race or whatever),  _then his system falls apart and he can’t pick
accurately_ – as if that single isolated piece of information has corrupted
his otherwise  _holistic_ decision making process.

When asked to describe how he does it, he gives a very illuminating answer:

_“I am really at a loss to explain what I am seeing, and have generally no
real clue how I come to a percentage. It is definitely a combination of a lot
of factors – but if I had to name a few, they might be: Does the horse look
happy or worried to be on the racetrack? What is the quality of the
relationship between the horse and the person that leads him to the race? Does
the horse appear healthy and fit? Are the jockey and horse a good match? Does
the horse trust his jockey and listen to him? Can the jockey understand the
horse and communicate with him properly? But again these are just some
impressions. It is not consistent and certainly not straightforward… Anyway,
after the race we can immediately see the accuracy of my predictions. Then the
process starts again in the next race.”_

Do you see how what he’s describing is a much more complete view of reality
than could be provided by a more “scientific” statistical analysis? How
despite being what many would describe as “wooly”, it is in fact far more
sophisticated than something more rigorous? The power of this process doesn’t
only come down to the sheer volume of inputs it incorporates, but rather as
McGilchrist notes: “part of the power of the unconscious mind is its capacity
to deal with numerous different elements simultaneously – and, even more
importantly, to see their interconnexions one with another”. Reality is a
_whole_ , and therefore an analytic process which breaks it down into “pieces”
(as the conscious mind must) is always going to be inferior to one which takes
it in as it truly  _is_.

He concludes:

_“Experts in any field need both to attend to the Gestalt, the picture as a
whole, and, occasionally, to engage in (preferably limited) analysis. Why
preferably limited? Because it has costs. It takes time, yes; but worse, it
also changes its object, risks focus on areas that may be inessential, risks
substituting something explicit and measurable for something much more
important that is implicit and unmeasurable.”_

What is funny about all this is that despite the mountains of evidence and
studies which prove time and again that intuitive decisions are superior to
analytic ones, we simply refuse to accept it. We refuse to accept a process
that is opaque to us, even when it is unambiguously shown to be superior.

You will note that you never get consulting firms, or other similar sorts of
professionals, selling their wares on the basis of intuition. McKinsey will
never say “hire us because our intuition is really good”. No, there always has
to be data capture and data analysis at the heart of any pitch – a process
which McGilchrist would argue basically amounts to a myopic focus on a
trivially small amount of information at the expense of the larger reality.

There is one good reason for this mistrust of intuition, and that is this:

**Intuition is only reliable in the hands of experts.**

If you are not comfortable in a given field, then you will probably not
achieve superior results via unconscious intuition than with conscious
deliberation. To take chess as an example, it has again been proven that great
chess players are almost wholly intuitive. For instance when they perform
exhibition matches where they play 50 different games against 50 different
opponents simultaneously, their performance only fractionally drops in
comparison to when they play a single game that they’re able to concentrate
on. However if you are a novice player, this doesn’t apply. You actually have
to think about what you’re doing very carefully, otherwise you’ll get
slaughtered.

It’s the same, in a way, with this newsletter. I openly admit to my clients
that despite there being elements of process, my work ultimately boils down to
me observing their business as a whole and giving my intuitive conclusions.
However this is only possible because I’ve thought about this stuff so much.
For people still learning about the field, they’re going to need to think
about things more deliberately if they want to make progress – and that’s why
I write these pieces, to build up that base layer of understanding that will
eventually allow effective intuition to be unleashed.

When all is said and done though, there is no analysis that can beat (well
informed) intuition.

  * There is no model which can mimic it.
  * No computer which can touch it (no, not even the sainted ChatGPT).
  * And no alternative accessible to the human mind which is going to yield better results.

We’ll never admit it, and we’ll always be happy to pay more for something that
looks more rigorous, predictable, and technically correct… but that doesn’t
stop it being true.
