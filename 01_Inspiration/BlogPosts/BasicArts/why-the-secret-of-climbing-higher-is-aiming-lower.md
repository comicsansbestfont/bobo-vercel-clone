You know who gives terrible advice?

**Really successful people.**

Billionaires, celebrities, top ranking athletes. You know, the very people
whose advice we most seek. The people whose advice is, supposedly, the  _most_
valuable.

I’ll get on to why this is, but first I want to outline why it’s important.

Human beings are copying creatures. We spend all our time modelling behaviours
we’ve seen elsewhere, in the hope they’ll make us happier, richer, smarter,
and more attractive than we are now. I’m doing it right now, in ways I don’t
even realise, and chances are so are you.

We model behaviours as individuals. And we model business behaviours too,
seeking to emulate the most successful companies, and the leaders who guide
them.

Considering this, we should be really careful about who we  _choose_ as our
models: because the quality of our outcomes is going to be directly reflective
of that choice.

And for my money, part of the reason most people struggle is because the
models that are held up for us to copy… well… they ain’t it.

So why is this? Why do the most successful people and brands often make bad
models?

It’s all a question of scale.

You see as things grow, they change. A big brand isn’t simply a “small brand,
but larger”. It’s an entirely different beast altogether. It exists in a
different environment, and plays by a different set of rules. The behaviours
that enable it to thrive are different from those that would enable a small
business to thrive.

This is true in any field.

Roger Federer isn’t like an ordinary club tennis player, but “better”. He’s
something else. He may know a lot about tennis in the abstract, but he has
very little understanding of what it’s like to be an ordinary amateur player,
and so the things that work for him won’t necessarily work for them.

Now of course this isn’t to say that a Federer, or a Fortune 500 CEO, would’t
have anything to teach a wannabe in their field. That’s not the point. The
point is that they make ineffective models for people looking to emulate them,
because the context they are adapted to is just so different. If you mimic
them  _out of context_ , your behaviours won’t fit, and you won’t thrive.

I myself have suffered in various ways from “modelling too high up”, and it’s
cost me dearly. Here are two examples:

  1. When I first started Basic Arts we were at the peak of what we might call the “aloof” agency era, when the top creative agencies were disappearing up their own arses and playing “hard to get” with clients. For example I remember a few of them had websites which were literally just a phone number and nothing else – as if being minimally courteous and helpful was “beneath their genius”. Coming from this world, I naturally thought this was super cool, and so tried to capture some of this in my earlier marketing efforts – something which was stupid on multiple levels: firstly because I didn’t have the reputation to support such a high risk game, and secondly because it didn’t even work for the top agencies that tried it (just look at how adland has sunk since…).
  2. Until very recently I’ve been extremely reluctant to be active on Linkedin – not for a well thought out strategic reason but because I didn’t necessarily see my intellectual idols doing it. “If it’s beneath them, then it’s beneath me!”. Again, stupid. Literal celebrities in their fields don’t hustle to build their platform because… they’re celebrities. They already have platform. That’s the definition of celebrity. And besides, even then many of them  _do_ work hard to nurture their platforms regardless. The truth is that for someone in my game being a Linkedin bore is a no-brainer, and in the short time I’ve been doing it I’ve already seen how effective it can be – so it pains me to think what I could have achieved if I’d been doing it for the past 5 years.

The way such poorly thought out modelling is likely to manifest is in pride.
In feeling that you’re somehow “better” than a certain grimy activity that
people in your situation would normally do.

What this actually means is that your  _models_ are better than it – as is
their prerogative, they’re top of the totem pole –  _but you are not_.

Unfortunately it seems to me that this kind of foolish pride is pervasive in
all walks of our culture, because we are continually saturated with stories of
the greatest most outlier-ish success. Our points of comparison aren’t our
neighbour, our colleague, or the company across town. They are Kim Kardashian,
Elon Musk, and OpenAI.

This drops us into the no-win game of constantly trying to close the chasm
between ourselves and them – which in practice means overreaching, seeking to
run before we can walk, and embracing grandiose pretensions that don’t serve
us in the here and now.

So what is the antidote to all this?

It’s simple.

**Don’t model yourself on the best. Model yourself on those a little bit ahead
of you.**

If you’re a consultant earning £100k, learn from the consultant earning £300k
– not McKinsey. If you’re an SME chocolate brand, model yourself on the brands
who’ve just broken through, not on KitKat. If you’re an 36 handicap golfer,
model yourself on an 18 handicapper – not Rory McIlroy.

It seems obvious when put like that, but it’s actually quite hard because
“models from the top” are easier to come by than “models in the middle”. It’s
the big dogs who get interviews, book deals, and our attention.

If you’re lucky you might be able to find accurate accounts from the very best
of what they did  _when they were in your situation_. I was recently listening
to the audiobook of Matthew McConaughey’s  _Greenlights_ , and was quite taken
aback by his accounts of his life before he was famous – it’s clear in
hindsight that he was behaving in ways that made his eventual success
extremely likely, if not inevitable.

But even then, the danger is that you’ll be modelling what worked 5, 10, 20
years ago, and not what will work  _now_. The model that is only 1 year ahead
of you is by definition more “up to date”.

We should also be mindful of the fact that the higher someone travels, the
more that luck and other non-replicable factors enter into their achievements.
Outlier success always contains an element of randomness. Perversely this
means that people at the  _very_ top are in some ways “worse” at their craft
than the people below them – they just have some magic X factor that gives
them the edge, and which means we should discount them from our analysis.

_(The world number 100 tennis player is almost certainly “better at tennis”
than Roger Federer, precisely because he’s achieved that status without the
un-replicable advantage of being Roger Federer!)_

All this doesn’t mean giving up the dream, and it doesn’t mean settling for
mediocrity.

You’re still on the ladder to the top.

It’s just you’re grabbing the rung right above you, rather than groping
pointlessly for the one in the far distance.
