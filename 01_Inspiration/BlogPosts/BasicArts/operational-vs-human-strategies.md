I suppose that if you pressed me on it, I’d say I consider myself a bit of an
expert on strategy. It is my job after all. However I should also stress that
the purpose of these essays isn’t just to teach you, but to teach me.
Sometimes complexities arise in the field that give me pause, and I need to
work them through here in order to restore my understanding.

This essay concerns just such a complexity, and I’ll warn you, it’s going to
get pretty nerdy.

The issue that follows demonstrates exactly why business strategy is such a
confusing and mismanaged subject. However I’ll endeavour to lay the matter out
as plainly as possible so that you (and I) don’t end up more perplexed than we
were coming in.

The topic today is the tension between what I’m going to call “operational”
and “human” strategies – two very different approaches to the same question
that are in constant unspoken conflict.

This was brought to my attention last week when a client sent me a strategic
modelling technique I wasn’t familiar with. I won’t go into the specifics here
as I’ve only skimmed it and wouldn’t want to misrepresent it, but basically it
involves mapping out different aspects of your business on a chart that shows
their varying levels of “maturity” and “visibility”. With this you can
understand the dynamics between them, and know where to direct your attention
and investment. It’s very clever, and clearly has the potential to reveal
areas of opportunity a business can attack in order to steal a march on its
competitors – e.g. by outsourcing a particular technology, buying a particular
supplier or complementary business, or building on a prior innovation at the
right time.

On the face of it, it’s pretty classic strategy wonkery – but what got me
thinking deeper about it was this:

**It largely disregards the consumer.**

Now don’t get me wrong, the opportunities it unlocks do have the potential to
deliver  _benefits_ to the consumer, and thus get market leverage. But those
benefits are arrived at “inside-out”, via clever operational changes, rather
by “observing the outside world” and adjusting the business’ offering
accordingly. So to give a grossly simplistic example, an electric car brand
might determine via this technique that it would be smart to buy a series of
lithium mines in order to control that part of production cycle, which then
trickle through to improved market strength in various ways — very effective,
but the  _opposite_ of adjusting the business based on a reading of consumer
priorities and perceptions.

This then is what I would call an “operational” approach to strategy: an
approach which (if I was to be a little reductive) boils down to
outmanoeuvring your competitors by consistently making smart organisational
decisions, which give you hard “utilitarian advantage”.

Now let’s compare that to “human” strategy, which is more of an “outside-in”
approach.

With human strategy a business makes its decisions primarily based on its
understanding of the world its consumers inhabit, which would include things
like:

  * Consumer behaviours, needs, and desires
  * Cultural understanding
  * Psychology
  * Relative perception vs. competitors
  * Market conditions
  * Etc.

…and then mapping them to its unique characteristics to uncover opportunities.

To give you an example let’s return to one of our favourites: Starbucks’
“third space” strategy, where they designed their stores to be “halfway
between the office and home” – i.e. productive and high energy, but also
comforting and pleasant. A valuable idea which hadn’t existed before.

This strategy, so far as I can see, couldn’t have been arrived at via the
aforementioned model, or any other operational technique, since it was built
first and foremost on an appreciation of consumer behaviours which sit
“outside” of the operational machine (albeit with some overlaps). In that
respect it is much more marketing driven than operational strategy would be,
but, crucially, it is not pure “dressing” or “presentation”, since it also
dictates hard operational changes.

The output is the same kind of thing, but the input is very different.

If we were to summarise this difference then, we might do it like this:

**Operational strategy = “Inside-out”**  
_Smart operational manoeuvres creating opportunities_

**Human strategy = “Outside-in”**  
_Smart consumer understanding creating opportunities_

Something like that.

When you see this divide, you can see how a lot of confusion arises. Basically
when people talk about “strategy” they are often unwittingly talking about two
different things. Yes, all strategy is the same in that it all ultimately
seeks to create leverage. But the  _processes_ and  _philosophies_ by which
you achieve that can be so varied as to almost be unrecognisable from each
other.

So how do we reconcile all this?

First I think we need to get a basic understanding of when to use each
strategic approach. When should we be operational, and when should we be
human.

This is a topic I need to think about more deeply, but speaking broadly I
would suggest that operational strategy should be the primary method for very
large corporations, and brands in the technology and manufacturing spaces.
Human strategy on the other hand should be the primary method for SMEs and
consumer brands.

Why?

In the case of large corporates and technologically oriented businesses,
operational strategy is effective primarily because such organisations have a
huge number of moving parts. If you have your fingers in many pies, then it
stands to reason that there is a lot to be gained by organising those pies
effectively. In the case of technology businesses, there is also the
consideration that market success for such brands tends to be extremely
utilitarian. If you’re a cloud computing provider say (which was where the
model I mentioned was developed), then you can achieve huge gains almost
overnight via a technological tweak, or building smart synergies with other
suppliers. The same can’t be said for, say, BMW or Zara, who are much more
“holistic” by nature, and don’t have the potential to achieve a sudden “check
mate” that destroys their competitors overnight.

It’s also important to note that many large corporates and technology
companies aren’t especially brand driven – either because they have multiple
“fronts” which prevents them from having a powerful singular identity (e.g.
like General Electric), or are selling a commodity / widget style product
where utility trumps all. This makes human strategies both more difficult to
arrive at and less effective for them.

By contrast if we look at most consumer brands and SMEs, human strategies are
far more accessible and effective. Firstly, such brands tend to be fairly one-
dimensional, and so will  _usually_ (though not always) lack the potential for
significant operational leverage. As a result they need to draw more on the
outside world, and to create gaps in  _perception_ as well as  _competency_.
And this, secondly, leads to them being more brand driven: meaning they must
integrate soft measures into their strategy, as well as hard.

I mean let’s be real, the operational differences between Haagen Dazs and Ben
& Jerry’s are fairly minor; but the overall strategic gap between them is
huge. This is typical of consumer brands; they can’t “kill” each other in a
game of chess, so instead they must take ownership of their individual
positions and coexist peacefully.

Ultimately we see this division largely reflected in the different parts of
the strategy industry.

Large firms like McKinsey, or more academic strategy consultants, will most
commonly find themselves working on operational strategies for big
conglomerates or businesses with lots of organisational complexity that can be
managed more effectively.

By contrast someone like myself who works mostly with consumer brands will
lean more towards human strategies – letting the external value offering drive
internal change, rather than the other way around.

In general I’d say this divide works pretty well, however I can’t help feeling
that we all may be missing a trick. Although these tendencies I’ve outlined
above will generally prove accurate, shouldn’t we begin every project with a
both an instrumental  _and_ human approach, simultaneously?

I can only speak for myself, but that’s something I’m going to strive for.
Strategic leverage can be found anywhere, so we’d be foolish to only seek it
on one half of the map.
