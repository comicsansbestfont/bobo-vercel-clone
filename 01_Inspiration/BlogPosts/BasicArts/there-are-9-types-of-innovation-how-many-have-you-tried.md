It was Peter Drucker who famously said:

“A business only has two functions: marketing and innovation. The rest are
just costs”.

And truth be told, since great marketing is simply a form of introducing
something _new_ to the market we could probably say that there is only one
central function:

**_Innovation._**

That is what your business exists to do. Nothing more.

Now what’s crazy about this is that most businesses don’t innovate _at all_.
They think it’s an “optional extra” rather than their very purpose for being.
And that’s why they struggle:

  * A business with no innovation is a business with nothing new
  * A business with nothing new is a business the same as its competitors
  * A business the same as its competitors is a commodity
  * A business that’s a commodity will have to cut margins to compete
  * A business that cuts margins to compete makes no money
  * A business that makes no money fails!

Pretty simple no?

So you’ve gotta innovate. You’ve gotta bring something new to the game,
otherwise you’re going to slip down this slope.

Now of course, this is easier said than done. Most businesses don’t innovate
because they can’t wrap their head around what an innovation might _look like_
in their industry.

“Sure”, they say, “it’s easy for a tech company to innovate – but we’re not
like that! Our industry isn’t innovative!”.

I get why you might think that, because the word innovation is very tech-
slanted. But it’s an illusion. The truth is that this sort of “technical
product feature” innovation is just one type of innovation; and there are
_eight others_.

Here’s the full list. Check it out, and I’m sure you’ll see that there are
many you could try.

_(Remember: the purpose of an innovation is not simply to be “new”, but to
deliver the unique value your strategy is focused on, so think of all of these
in that context)_

**Type 1: Product features**

_Unique widgets or functionality to deliver your value._

Example: the removable doors on the Ford Bronco.

**Type 2: Means of production**

_Unique processes in creating your product that deliver your value._

Example: McDonald’s fast-food assembly line.

**Type 3: Routes to market and distribution**

_Unique channels that help you deliver your value._

Example: Red Bull’s extreme sport event creation and partnerships.

**Type 4: Service bundling**

_Unique blends of products and services that generate new value._

Example: Peloton’s combination of exercise classes and hardware.

**Type 5: Branding and presentation**

_Unique visual and communication angles to land your value._

Example: Liquid Death’s heavy metal aesthetic.

**Type 6: Customer targeting**

_Unique choice of target customer who need a particular value offer._

Example: Justin Welsh’s solopreneur segment creation.

**Type 7: Customer experience**

_Unique ways of interacting with customers that deliver new value._

Example: Octopus Energy instantly picking up the phone.

**Type 8: Pricing**

_Unique ways of charging customers gives them new value._

Example: Spotify letting you have music “for free” with ads.

**Type 9: Culture**

_Unique ways to handle your team that helps generate value._

Example: Patagonia’s “surf time” and Google’s “20% time”
