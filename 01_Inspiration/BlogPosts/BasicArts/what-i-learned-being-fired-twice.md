This is a slightly tricky essay to write. Not for the obvious reason that it
brings up potentially embarrassing episodes from my past, but actually for the
_opposite_ reason: that these days it’s hard to write about “being fired”
without it sounding like you’re bragging.

It’s a weird thing, but as we have discussed before, in this [perma-
revolutionary age](https://us16.campaign-
archive.com/?u=dbfcfcd097fd0818275a2b8b8&id=4e78d6139e) any form of mildly
“disruptive” individualism is seen as sexy and desirable, even when it’s
pretty stupid.  _True_ divergence is still frowned upon of course (in many
ways we are the most conformist society of all time), but  _stylistic_
divergence, without any real substance to it? Well that’s the dream isn’t it.
And getting fired from a couple of corporate behemoths, the way I did, is a
good example of that.

So yeah, it would be easy to write this with a flavour of “I was just too
smart and edgy for those mindless drones”. And indeed, for a couple of years
after the events, that’s pretty much what I thought.

**But I don’t think that now.**

Today, with the benefit of 15 years’ distance, I see it a little differently.
I can see that my run-in with the global corporate world doesn’t reflect
positively or negatively on either of us. Instead it simply reveals an
important dividing line in the dynamics between employee and employer – one
that has indirectly informed a lot of my thinking, and that I want to share
here.

So, first of all, what happened?

I’m sorry to say it was nothing terribly scandalous. My first two jobs were
with EY, one of the “Big 4” accountancy firms, and then L’Oréal – in both
cases as part of their “fast track” graduate trainee schemes. The two
experiences were pretty much a carbon copy of each other: overall I felt I was
doing a decent job (at least in terms of the actual work produced), and yet
wherever I went I couldn’t help leaving silent ripples of disapproval in my
wake. These spread through the management teams largely without me knowing,
making me a “dead man walking” long before the axe fell.

There were no dramatic moments worth recounting – other than perhaps when I
made a joke about a speech by EY’s head of audit in my first week on the job,
which went down about as well as you’d imagine. No, really the issue was just
one of consistent irritating “prodding” by me – questioning processes,
pointing out contradictions, talking out of turn, and generally not performing
my function as a low level cog in the machine, which was simply to keep
turning  _smoothly_.

There was no grand “firing”. Unless you do something terrible these
organisations don’t work like that. Instead they just sort of process you out,
like a body’s immune system rejecting a virus. One day you’re there, the next
you’re peripheral, and the next you’re gone – all with impressively little
fuss.

It’s at this point where it would be easy to construct a case in my defence –
about how these sorts of companies can’t handle challenge, independent
thinking, creativity, etc etc. About how they are slow to move, and incapable
of innovation or change.

But that’s not the right lesson.

Even if we accept that I was correct in all the challenges I gave them while I
was there (and that’s a pretty big “if”), the fact remains that this is simply
not the way a mature, global, organisation actually works.

Giant brands quite simply don’t  _need_ change. They don’t  _need_ disruption.
They sure as hell don’t need it from a know-nothing 23 year old! What they
need instead is continuing, reliable,  _operational excellence_ – something
which is pretty much the opposite to the value I was providing.

True to form, this is probably a pretty contrarian view. Certainly the
organisations themselves would disagree. They and everyone else seem to think
that big corporates need “change” and “fresh thinking” now more than ever.
That if they don’t embrace new ideas and new ways of doing things that their
hegemony will be short lived, and that they’ll soon crumble in the face of an
insurgent “disruptor”. Just look at Kodak, Blockbuster, and all the other well
publicised Goliaths who have been taken down by a trendy young David!

But come on, if we’re honest, this isn’t really true. It’s just another
example of the change fetish that permeates the rest of our culture.

In reality the imperative for these kinds of brands is  _not to change_ – or
perhaps more accurately, not to change  _quickly_ , or  _proactively_. Why?
Because the defining character of most markets is not progress or evolution,
but rather  _inertia_. For every one category that has been turned on its
head, there are a hundred others that have remained pretty much static for 50
years. You don’t hear about them of course, just like you don’t hear about all
the people who  _aren’t_ murdered every day, or all the countries that
_don’t_ go to war. They’re pretty much invisible, but they’re out there all
the same.

This inertia stems directly from human nature. Contrary to the myth we’re fed
about people constantly looking for “newer and better solutions”, the reality
is that what people  _really_ want is to have a certain purchasing decision
decided for them –  _and then to never have to think about it ever again_.

Let’s say you use Colgate toothpaste (or one of the other two or three big
legacy brands in that space). Chances are you will continue to do so until the
day you die. This issue is now sorted in your life. It’s done. You’ve got
better things to think about. Even if a “better” toothpaste comes along, so
what? You’ll probably never even become aware of it, let alone wrench yourself
our of a lifelong purchasing habit.

When a solution becomes “adequate” like this, then its market becomes
“mature”, and thus “inert” – at which point it takes a truly extraordinary
chain of events to change things.

EY and L’Oréal exist in just such inert spaces. The odds are massively in
their favour that they’ll both still be market leaders in 50 years time, with
minimal creativity required on their part. Will things change? Sure they will.
But probably in an incremental fashion which such companies can absorb without
too much difficultly. Does it matter if a new trend in skincare comes along
and catches L’Oréal flat footed? Not really. Most punters will continue buying
the old stuff regardless, and after 2 or 3 years they’ll have come up with
their own version of it anyway. It’s no big deal.

The only real external market threat they face is a change occurring that is
so seismic that it demands a whole new business model (Kodak / Blockbuster
style) – but outside of the initial chaos that came when the world adapted to
the internet, this basically never happens. And even then it happened way less
than you think.

Consequently such businesses are right to recognise that the true threat to
their position is in fact  _internal_. It comes not from a lack of new ideas,
but rather from new ideas themselves. For a mature business in an inert
market, every new idea is a risk. Every innovation, every clever strategy is
more likely to damage the business than to help it.

Often the catalyst for such corporate self-harm is the overemphasis on a
perceived external threat. When Target started eating into Walmart’s market
share, the business panicked, and went on an innovation spree which – surprise
surprise – did far more harm than Target ever did. When Walmart saw the error
of their ways, and reverted to their old model, things recovered.

Every EY, every L’Oréal, is vulnerable to “doing a Walmart”. And all it takes
is allowing a little too much “disruptive thinking” into their bloodstream. A
little too much questioning of the status quo which is frankly just fine the
way it is.

So all in all, I think they were right in their assessment of my value to
their organisations. It probably worked out better for both of us.

By contrast my next move – and every move since – was into the world of
“immature” businesses, who, by definition, have the  _reverse_ risk
relationship with change. When I say “immature” here I don’t necessarily mean
young or small; I simply mean those which aren’t among the few hundred
immovable global titans who profit disproportionally from inertia.

Although there are exceptions, businesses such as these exist in highly
changeable states. It’s not much of an exaggeration to say that they could 10x
in size or completely fail in the space of a couple of years – two scenarios
which are basically impossible for an inert giant.

Consequently these businesses require two types of input: operational
excellence (just like the giants)  _and_ a bit of friction. Without the former
they’ll just be incompetent, and without the latter they risk being swallowed
up by the churn around them.

That’s my home, and I guess it’s probably your home too.

_(Annoying questioners do exist in big corporates, no doubt, but they have to
operate with a huge amount of grace and diplomacy – big respect to those who
pull it off!)_

**What I want to leave you with here then is the point that change isn’t
necessarily good. It isn’t necessarily useful.**

Sometimes – perhaps more often than we care to admit – the greater virtue is
to just keep the wheel turning. To actually dig deep into process, craft, and
steadiness.

It’s easy to attack corporate myopia (I know I have), and yes, a lot of the
bureaucratic wrangling that takes place within their walls is truly silly. But
ultimately, it serves a larger strategic purpose.

I didn’t see that then, but I see it now.
