When you’re facing a task that doesn’t have a solution that you know will work
at the outset.

There is no “strategy” to fixing a muffler, or flying a jet, or tying
pigtails; there is just a method. Strategy is reserved for the many walks of
life where there are no neat and tidy solutions like this. Economics,
politics, marriage, fashion sense, investing, becoming a pop star, and of
course, running a business.

Understandably, a lot of people have a problem with this. It means that you
are utterly culpable for your decisions. There’s no hiding from it. You have
to make big calls which, rather than being factual and objective, are merely
judgement calls. _Opinions_.

Strategy isn’t scientific, even if it’s informed by a set of facts, because it
pertains to the _predicted interaction of those facts_. In other words, it’s
just somebody’s hunch when you get right down to it; and if that somebody is
you, you’re going to be left exposed if things go wrong.

A willingness to put your neck on the line like this is one of the most
fundamental attributes required in a founder. You know that “Logan Roy” (from
_Succession_ – watch it!) stereotype of entrepreneurs as people who make
decisions based on gut-feeling, and who hold numbers-obsessed “boffins” in
contempt? That stereotype exists for a reason. You need to be comfortable with
making opinion-based decisions, because most of the time, that’s the only type
of decision you’ll be able to make.

Unfortunately, in recent times, there has been a challenge to this strategic
way of operating: “data”.

Data, the way most people use the term, simply means quantified information.
Numbers. Hard and supposedly objective. Data is what scientists and engineers
use in order to get predictable and replicable outcomes. When you’re designing
a bridge, there’s no question of whether your “strategy” to prevent it
collapsing will work. You aren’t just taking a punt based on your opinion,
your “personal read” of the situation. You _know_ it will work, because you
have an objective “data-driven” (scientific) solution to the problem. Strategy
doesn’t come into it.

Wouldn’t it be nice then, if we could have a similar level of certainty when
it comes to business matters? Imagine if we could collect enough cold hard
data that our decisions ceased to be speculative punts, and instead become as
reliable and scientific as those of the engineer?

This, of course, is complete nonsense. Such an aspiration, if someone was
stupid enough to hold it, would be committing a grave category error, by
confusing open “chaotic” problems (like business) with closed “ordered”
problems (like engineering). With open problems, _there is no amount of data_
you could hypothetically collect which would remove opinion (AKA [strategic
thinking](https://basicarts.org/newsletter/)) from the equation, because you
are exposed to an infinite number of constantly changing variables, which
interact in unpredictable ways.

Very few people (although not zero) fall for such a fallacy, thank God. But a
great number of people do fall for its softer cousin, what I call the “numbers
bias”.

With the numbers bias, founders (or anyone really), will lean too heavily on
available “numbers data” in their decision making, at the expense of
everything else, due to the illusion of objectivity it brings. They aren’t
deluded enough to believe that their decisions are “scientific”, but data at
least gives their decisions that sort of “flavour”, and thus makes them feel
more secure. If things go wrong you can always say “hey, I was just doing what
the data told me”, which sounds sort of plausible until you remember that data
can never tell you what to do, only your strategic interpretation can.

Therefore, contrary perhaps to the statty image
“[strategists](https://basicarts.org/work-with-us/)” sometimes have, in order
to make strong decisions in business you need to have a healthy _scepticism
for data_ , and to be immune from the numbers bias.

Now don’t misunderstand me, I’m not saying “ignore data” here. What I’m saying
is “don’t put it on a pedestal over other forms of evidence just because it
feels more safe”.

_Data is merely one form of evidence_ – and not an especially good one at
that. There are all sorts of other forms of evidence that should influence
your thinking which doesn’t come packaged in data form, for instance:

  * What are the qualities of your product? What are its strengths and weaknesses? What is surprising about it? What is different about it? How might people react to it?
  * What are the dynamics of the market? Who’s on the up, who’s on the down? Who do you admire, who do you hate? Who is stocked where? What moves are your competitors making?
  * What do your employees think? What would motivate them? What would motivate you? What seems like it would be fun?
  * What is your history? What do people expect from you? What would they not expect from you?
  * What are the relevant characteristics of the culture you’re operating in? What could you bounce off in your actions? What do people associate you with?

And so on and so on.

All of this stuff _is also data_ – and just because it doesn’t have a number
attached to it, or isn’t unimpeachably objective, that doesn’t make it any
less relevant or powerful. Your job is to absorb all of this information, as
much as you can, and then simply give your opinion on how it all clicks
together. That’s it. Your opinion is your strategy. Sure, some people have
better opinions than others ([this
newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/53e8061f1686/basicarts) is concerned with
improving the quality of your opinion), but make no mistake, it will never be
anything more than your subjective take.

The unsophisticated, blunt, gut-instinct-driven founder is simply the founder
who has absorbed this kind of information, views it _holistically_ , and makes
their decisions accordingly.

In this way they are actually far far more sophisticated than the precision-
oriented analyst: who reduces problems to something carrying the air of
objectivity, but in doing so removes the fluid dynamic of reality.

The good news in all this for [independent
businesses](https://basicarts.org/why-big-brand-thinking-is-poison-for-
independents/), is that this is an area where they can have a big advantage
over large corporates.

Firstly, they don’t tend to actually have a lot of data, and so don’t even
have the option of naively outsourcing their decisions to it. Indeed, a great
number of my clients have had essentially _no usable data_ when I’ve worked
with them. Clearly, this isn’t a good thing (quality information of any shape
is always welcome), but at least it forced us to gather evidence for our
thinking broadly and insightfully. Conversely, the disadvantage for a business
with a lot of data is that they often assume that the “answer” will lie
somewhere within it, and thus are liable to ignore everything else. The
absolute nadir of this disease – which is rare but not unheard of – is data
dogmatism; where data is demanded to “prove” _any_ statement, including the
ones which should be self-evident via common sense. If you sink that deep into
“objectivity” then I’m afraid there’s no coming back.

The second advantage that an independent business has over a corporate in this
regard is having a true decision-maker – the founder. Typically executives in
public corporations don’t have (or don’t want) the freedom to make “non-
objective” decisions, and thus are bound by the scope of their data. This
means they struggle to make bold strategic plays, and thus become gradually
more and more ossified. An independent business doesn’t get its advantage over
such companies by being more “agile”, but by being more _free_ – free to make
“unsubstantiated” decisions.

So recognise this supposed weakness of yours for what it is – a strength.

And get comfortable with having an opinion, because you’re going to need it.
