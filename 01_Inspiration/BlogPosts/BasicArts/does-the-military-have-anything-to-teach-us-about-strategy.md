I’m going to level with you here, I’ve not actually read Sun Tzu’s _The Art of
War_.

I know, I know, what kind of strategist am I? A pretty poorly read one, truth
be told. I did not learn my craft “top down”, through careful study of
canonical texts and Harvard Business Review papers, but rather “bottom up”,
through experience, observation, and noticing patterns.

Aside from laziness, I promise you there is a benefit to this informal
approach. It allows me to arrive at similar conclusions others have before,
but using different articulation. This is important, because new ways of
describing ideas can open those ideas up to new people. I’m not trying to
write papers for an MBA course here, they’ve got enough fodder, so I try not
to sink too deeply into that classical world.

However, when it comes to _The Art of War_ in particular, there is another
reason I’ve avoided it and that is this:

**War and business aren’t the same thing.**

That’s stating the obvious, clearly, but what I mean more specifically is that
they aren’t _dynamically_ the same thing. Techniques that work in one field
don’t scan to the other – despite there being an entire industry of books,
speakers, anecdotes and analogies that say otherwise.

The reason for this is simple: war is zero sum, but business generally is not.
On the battlefield you have two armies, each plotting the destruction of the
other, with the winner being the last left standing. But in the marketplace
that almost never happens. A much better analogy here is a natural ecosystem,
with a multitude of parties co-existing in a symbiotic manner.

Put bluntly, you’re not going to “kill” your competitor; you’re just going to
share territory in a hopefully profitable and sustainable way. Thus any
literature which doesn’t point at this outcome is always going to be a bit
misleading.

Still, while I stand by this view, I’d certainly never claim that you can’t
learn anything from these texts, providing they’re taken with a pinch of salt.
And I was reminded of this the other day when I saw this quote from another
historical strategic bigwig, the Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz:

_“Simplicity in planning fosters energy in execution. Strong determination in
carrying through a simple idea is the surest route to success. The winning
simplicity we seek, the simplicity of genius, is the result of intense mental
engagement.”_

Now at first glance this is just another of those empty-sounding strategic
truisms. Blah blah “simplicity” blah blah “execution” etc. Kind of goes in one
ear and out the other. And yet, when we remember its military context, we can
find another layer of subtlety there.

Imagine, for a moment, what it’s like to be a general. It’s the ultimate
“people management” challenge. Think you find it hard to manage _your_ team?
What if there were 100,000 of them, mostly uneducated, no modern communication
tools, and they were all scared shitless of dying. Three-sixty performance
reviews aren’t quite going to cut it there.

Because of this, someone like von Clausewitz understands something a lot of
founders and CEOs don’t:

**Getting your team to execute as a unit is more important than what they
actually execute.**

Notice his key phrases there: “energy in execution”, “strong determination”.
These are the strategic outputs he values. Not “what’s the cleverest plan”,
but rather “what plan will everyone get behind”.

I believe this insight has profound business implications.

We can be seduced into thinking that plans are either factually “right” or
“wrong”; that the right one will succeed and the wrong one will fail. Whilst
this is definitely somewhat true, it isn’t the whole story. We should also
think of plans as being “potent” or “impotent”.

Potent plans are those which:

  * Everyone understands
  * Can’t be lost in translation
  * Are intuitively easy to execute
  * Are inspiring and motivating

Impotent plans are those which:

  * Are complex
  * Can be interpreted in different ways
  * Have to be thought about to execute
  * Are a bit dry or boring

Can a plan be both right _and_ impotent? Definitely. In fact that’s probably
the most common type of plan. And equally a plan can be wrong and _potent_
too.

The implication of von Clausewitz’s quote is that the latter of these may
often be superior to the former, because at least it will be suffused with
_energy_ and _will_. Provided it isn’t flat out stupid those qualities will
probably be enough to produce good results – or at least better results than
intelligent impotency.

A helpful way to think about it perhaps is to imagine strategy not as a
“clever plan”, but rather as a “leadership tool”. The path to producing it
should be clever, that’s for sure. As he says in his quote, “the simplicity of
genius is the result of intense mental engagement”. But the final judgement
criteria shouldn’t be about that – it should be about whether it has the power
to rally the troops.

**Have you ever encountered a strategy which gets the team “pumped”? No? Then
maybe you’ve never really encountered a strategy.**

Military strategists may not understand market dynamics. But they do
understand what strategies are made of. Not brains, data, and analytics, but
blood, bone, and adrenaline.

Luckily nobody’s going to die if we forget this. But maybe let’s try to
remember anyway.
