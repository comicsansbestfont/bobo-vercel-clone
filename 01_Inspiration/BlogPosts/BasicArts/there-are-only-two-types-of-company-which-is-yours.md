People love processes. So it’s a shame that strategy doesn’t really have one.

As we’ve explored in some depth before, there is no set technique by which you
can figure out your path to growth. There is no reliable model for creating
uncontested market space. There is no algorithm or formula for discovering
where your company can get the most leverage.

There is only common sense. Observing conditions with curiosity and humility,
and trying to make sense of what you see.

In some ways this is an inherent weakness of my business model. It means I
can’t package anything up and sell it at scale. I can’t blow smoke at people
about my “proprietary system”, and franchise it out to a network of
consultants around the world. I mean technically _I could_ … but it would be
disingenuous. I just don’t believe that’s how things work.

That said, there is perhaps one exception. One idea which I think does,
somewhat, “systematise” strategy, and give businesses a model of sorts to
follow.

It’s very broad, very high level, but I’ve found it extremely helpful for
founders in directing their thinking. Hopefully you’ll find it helpful too.

Quite simply, you need to pick which kind of business you are from these two
options:

– _Are you a business who “weirds the normal”? (Type A)_

_– Or are you a business who “normalises the weird”? (Type B)_

All successful brands, in my experience, must fall into one of these two
categories – and they set the agenda for how they should be making decisions.

Let’s break them down.

**Type A – Weirding the normal**

Type A is the most common. These are businesses who do something normal,
something which lots of other businesses do, and therefore must focus on
putting a new “spin” on that thing. In other words, “weirding the normal”.

If your business is soap, cars, gyms, cereal, air travel, restaurants,
furniture, socks, IT solutions, recruitment, stationery – anything where there
are lots of broadly equivalent options, and a well established category – then
this is your job.

This is because the world fundamentally _doesn’t need_ another one of these
things – unless it can bring a completely new interpretation to the table. It
must take the safe and make it dangerous; bring never-before-seen value to the
industry; or carve out a new sub category.

The imperative for such businesses is to be extremely bold and take big risks,
especially stylistically, because what they are doing is, at root, totally
boring. Consumers feel safe in these categories, so it takes real fire to
shake them out of their inertia.

This stands in stark contrast to…

**Type B – Normalising the weird**

Less common, although by no means rare, are Type B companies. These are the
ones who have a product that’s genuinely something new, and demands a new
behaviour from consumers.

For example my client MOJU, when they introduced juice shots to the UK market,
fit this category. Another client, Bio-tiful Dairy, were the same when they
introduced kefir. Although both of these products had existed before
elsewhere, to the average man on the street in England they were totally
alien. Type B companies are also common in tech – the likes of Uber, Airbnb,
and Deliveroo all demanded unprecedented behaviours from their customers.

Such brands need a completely different mindset to Type A.

Because their product is fundamentally unusual, their job isn’t to make it
feel radical and exciting, but rather friendly and safe. They need to teach
people to use it, since they can’t rely on pre-existing habits. Hence
“normalising the weird”.

This is not straight forward, and as a result most of these businesses fail:
not because the product isn’t good, but because they never found a way to make
people “get it”. Often such products are open to many different
interpretations, and there will be tensions within the business over which to
emphasise, leading to muddle and confusion.

Successful revolutions don’t arrive with fireworks, but quietly, without us
even realising. Such delicate ingratiation should be the guiding principle of
Type Bs.

Understanding which type of business you run, and behaving accordingly, is as
close to a strategy “hack” as I can think of.

Typically people get this precisely the wrong way round.

Type A companies can’t resist slipping into the well worn grooves of category
codes, mimicking the dozens of other brands around them. And Type B companies
can’t resist drinking their own Kool-Aid and assuming that the public will be
as excited about their idea as they are, and so end up emphasising their
uniqueness rather than their sameness.

Therefore finding your way begins with this simple designation.

It won’t tell you exactly what to do. But it will tell you what not to do. And
as always that’s more than half the battle.
