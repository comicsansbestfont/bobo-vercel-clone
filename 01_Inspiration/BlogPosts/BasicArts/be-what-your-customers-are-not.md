Occasionally I’ve seen it noted that the more normal, safe, and suburban
someone’s life, the more gruesome and unpleasant the novels they like to read.

There’s a great line in the sitcom Peep Show where socially awkward Mark
thinks to himself:

_“Look at me; I’ve got a girlfriend. A proper girlfriend reading a best-seller
about child-abuse. I go out and have a croissant. I’m just a normal
functioning member of the human race and there’s no way anyone can prove
otherwise.”_

I love the fact that he conflates reading about horrible subjects with
normalcy here, as there’s an interesting insight there. In short, we are
engaged in a constant struggle to _balance_ our lives, and we use art and
culture to fill in the gaps that fall outside our own experience.

To use another quote, this time from Alain de Botton:

_“The art we love is frequently something we’re drawn to because it
compensates us for what we lack. It counterbalances us. When we’re moved by a
work of art, it may be because it contains concentrated doses of qualities we
need more of in our lives.”_

Now OK, nobody needs more child abuse in their lives – or serial killers, or
vampires, or whatever else makes up the bulk of popular page turners – but we
do need drama. We do need the dark, the dangerous, and the bleak. To touch the
abyss, however slightly. And, so if you lead a live far removed from these
things, then they will need “topping up” one way or another; rebalancing the
beige security of your day to day existence.

As such, Mark was quite right – reading books like this is, in some way, the
ultimate signal of normalcy. Your life is so blandly pleasant that you
actively need to seek out the unpleasant to level things up. (And though I
don’t have the stats I’d wager that such books aren’t top of the charts in,
say, war zones).

For another example, think back to the late 1990s. This was a time when the
prevailing sentiment was one of crushing stability and prosperity. Only a
couple of years earlier Francis Fukuyama had made his unfortunate comment
about “the end of history”, “that is, the end-point of mankind’s ideological
evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final
form of human government”. It was an era when, for many in the West, it did
indeed feel we had “arrived”. And frankly, looking back on it, this was pretty
nice. I certainly feel deep nostalgia for the 90s, and I’m sure many of you do
too.

Considering this context however, what do you think the prevailing theme of
the movies of this period was? Comfort, peace, and celebration?

On the contrary, it was boredom.

Both _Fight Club_ and _The Matrix_ – probably the two films that defined the
era more than any other – railed against mankind’s “domestication”. They
pushed back against the cushy consumerist life of the “cubicle drone”. They
both explicitly demanded freedom and meaning, even (or perhaps especially) if
that meant discomfort. The wild animal lives a shorter, more brutish life than
his caged cousin. But, these movies claimed, such a price is well worth it.

The lesson here then, is that if you want to create a culturally meaningful
artefact, it must cut against the grain of the zeitgeist. It must rebalance
people’s lives.

Clearly, this applies to brands too. They are just as much cultural creations
as movies and novels. They too are things which people consume in order to
rebalance themselves – not only functionally, but emotionally too.

Founders, marketing directors, brand managers in particular – they don’t seem
to get this anymore. They have come to believe that the only way to appeal to
consumers is to act as a mirror; to reflect their lives right back at them.
This, in part, is why there is such contemporary focus on concepts such as
inclusivity. It’s not benevolence per se that drives this: it’s a belief that
people “buy what they are” – and if you believe that, then naturally you will
be concerned with accurately reflecting the diversity of society (which is of
course extremely hard to do other than with the blandest of generalities).

**But the thing is, people don’t “buy what they are”. They buy what they
aren’t.**

The proverbial bored housewife is not a serial killer – she is the opposite.
The 90s cubicle drone isn’t a member of an underground boxing ring – he is the
opposite. And that is why these concepts speak to them.

So perhaps it’s time to stop thinking about what your customers are and to
start thinking a little more about what they aren’t. In the context of brand
positioning for your category, there are probably only one or two answers to
the first question – and they’re probably rather dull. But answers to the
second question are unlimited. This is where true representation and inclusion
can be found, because although there may not be much we have in common, there
is loads that we don’t have in common.

And ironically these things have just as much capacity to bind us.
