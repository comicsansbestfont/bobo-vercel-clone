The last person who should be the judge of whether you have a strategy is you.

Everyone has a strategy in their head. Or at least, something they vaguely
label as “strategy”. But that’s not where strategy lives, in your head.
Instead it lives “out there”. In the fabric of the business, the minds of your
team, and the reaction of the market.

If you want to know whether you have a strategy, it is _there_ that you should
be looking. And it is _those things_ that should be the judge.

So, to that end, I want to give you three simple tests to check if there
really is a living breathing strategy in your organisation.

Let’s get straight into it.

## I. The profit test

In the final analysis there is only one sure fire test of an effective
strategy:

**Do you make more profit than your industry average?**

Everything else can be faked or forced – growth, sales, etc. – but this
cannot. It is the ultimate settling point of strategic maturity.

The idea here is that ever industry has a generic norm which earns a certain
amount of profit on average – let’s say for instance that an average cereal
brand makes 30% (no idea if that’s true, I’m just making it up). This means
that an unstrategic business, who have hustled and executed well, can expect
that sort of return.

A strategic business however, is one as we know that has found a way to
deliver unique value to the market. This in turn should mean that it 1) can
charge more, and 2) needs to spend less to compete. It also might mean that
its costs of production are less, if it’s a price leader. Either way, all of
this adds up to an ability to make _more profit_.

Now, if you _aren’t_ making more profit, and are still right in the middle of
the pack, then I would be inclined to ask: where’s the leverage? Where’s the
proof you’re doing something different?

You might be able to _talk_ a good game, but ultimately if you’re not seeing
greater returns, then I struggle to see the point.

_(NB there are of course time-limited exceptions to this rule, for example
when you are still growing into your strategic position, or in those rare
cases where you are pursuing unprofitable growth as part of a long term push
for dominance, a la Amazon. You should be able to tell pretty easily whether
these apply to you!)_

## II. The decision test

An under-appreciated job of a great strategy is this:

**It replaces _you_ as leader.**

You see as a business rolls along, invariably there are decisions to be made.
Should we do this, or that? Should we go here, or there? Should we turn left,
or right? And, in an unstrategic business, it is you who will make those
decisions – one by one, each on their own terms.

Businesses with strong strategy don’t work like that. Because in them, that
endless string of decisions is all directed at a clear and focused endpoint –
the strategy. This means that many decisions simply melt away, because the
“macro decision” of the strategy has answered them for you.

It also means that on a day-to-day level you personally should be “deciding”
far less. Rather than telling your team what you “think” they should do, you
can simply say “what does the strategy tell us to do?”. Naturally this won’t
apply to every decision – it won’t tell you whether you should fire the guy
caught stealing paper clips – but it will apply to the big ones.

The test then is to ask whether there is a clear “authority” in the business
other than you. A decision making tool that people can refer to for reliable
answers, without having to think from first principles every time. And
furthermore, one that knits all the decisions together into a cohesive whole.

If you can’t point to such a tool, then, I would suggest, you can’t really
point to a strategy either.

## III. The panic test

The first two tests are somewhat sophisticated. This one isn’t, and is so much
the better for it. Just do this:

**Approach your team members individually, and ask them “what is our
strategy?”.**

Why is this called the panic test? Well you will know when you see the look on
their faces when asked this most cruel of all questions.

I barely need to explain this one, you can probably sing it with me. Strategy
manifests in coherent action. And who is responsible for that action? The
team. And so who, out of everyone, should have the strategy at the tip of
their tongue? The team!

This is obvious, and yet a business who could do this exercise without
creating panic would class as a genuine museum-piece.

Now, in fairness, part of the issue here is the way the question is phrased.
Due to the slippery nature of the word “strategy” it may be that people don’t
readily connect the high leverage idea at the heart of the biz with the
question.

However, assuming there is _something_ which passes for a strategy, there
_must_ have been an occasion where you communicated it right? It must have
been talked about? Been shared? It must have some sort of articulated _life_
within the organisation? If so, then you know the _way_ it is talked about,
and therefore you can phrase the question to accord with that.

If not, however – if there is no piece of strategic information that has been
hammered into people’s brains – then frankly you don’t even need to bother to
do the test. You _know_ there is no coherent answer they can give, because you
never gave them one in the first place!

It’s a funny one this, the way that people think you can have a strategy
without actually communicating the thing. Without making a fuss about it. Your
whole job as a leader is basically to be a propagandist for the idea, so if
you’re keeping it under your hat then you may as well not have one at all.

___

If these seem like impossibly high standards to hit, you are right – _this is
why most businesses are unstrategic_.

It stands to reason the majority would fail, just as it stands to reason most
businesses aren’t the market leader. We are shooting for glory here, we are on
a journey to a place where few ever get to tread.

Easy is not part of the deal.

What is part of the deal however, is the joy of the challenge. And if that’s
your kind of thing, at least now you know the shape of it. Start working.
