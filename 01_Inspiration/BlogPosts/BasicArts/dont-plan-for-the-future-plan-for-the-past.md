Strategy is traditionally seen as a forward-looking exercise.

This stands to reason since, in the words of my pal Robin Bonn, every strategy
is essentially a “bet” that a certain course of action will work out in the
future. We think that X is going to happen and therefore we are going to do Y
thing in order to exploit that.

That, I would say, is the traditional definition.

However, this definition has one pretty massive problem:

_It asks you to predict the future._

It demands that you look in your crystal ball, paint a picture of what
conditions will be in 1, 5, 10 years’ time, and plan accordingly. And this
isn’t great because – as we are constantly reminded – _predicting the future
is something humans cannot do_.

Even in cases where it appears someone has successfully predicted the future,
and strategised accordingly, generally it’s an illusion.

Conventional wisdom assumes that Toyota strategised their successful invasion
of the USA in the early 80s. They predicted that the American market would
start to favour smaller, more economical cars, answered that need, and the
rest is history. However, in reality the driving force for their growth was
the completely _unpredictable_ oil crisis of the mid-70s. This made
traditional American cars far too expensive to run, causing drivers to seek
out cheaper alternatives. The fact that Toyota and other Japanese
manufacturers fit the bill wasn’t because they had predicted the crisis – it
was because gas prices were _already_ high in Japan, causing them to make
economical cars as a matter of course.

In other words? What looked like master strategising was closer to dumb luck.

Considering this, one could be forgiven for questioning whether there’s any
point in strategy at all. If we can’t predict the future aren’t we better off
simply hedging our bets and remaining agile and responsive to whatever comes
around the corner?

Certainly, this is the viewpoint some organisations take, but I think there’s
a better third option:

_Strategy as a backward-looking exercise._

Backward-looking strategy rejects any attempt to predict the future, and
instead looks back on the history of the company in order to understand what
has worked for it in the past. Once fully understood, this becomes the
strategic focus of the business, propelling it into the future come what may.

With the backward-looking mindset, strategy ceases to be a speculative
exercise, and instead becomes one of enhanced focus and attack.

The reason this is generally successful is that most markets don’t change
dramatically from one year to the next. There are exceptions to this of
course. The format wars of consumer technology through the 80s, 90s, and 00s,
fought between concepts like VHS, Betamax, DVD, Minidisc, etc. was genuinely
turbulent, with each option having to be wildly speculative in their strategic
plays. But such market conditions are extremely rare. At most you are probably
dealing with some vague and slowly emerging consumer trends like “ethical” or
“plant based” or “data led” (ugh) – and even in these cases adherence to these
trends is entirely optional. The brands who reject them are as likely to
thrive as die.

When you think about it this point is bloody obvious, since many businesses
have _never_ meaningfully changed their strategies. How they deliver on them
might evolve a bit, but the core market position remains relatively untouched.
Good strategies – especially in consumer markets – are often evergreen. The
dominant brands 10 years ago in most sectors remain amongst the dominant
brands today. Prediction, schmediction.

In summary then, get your head out of the tea leaves. Businesses that try to
design themselves for the world of tomorrow have extremely low hit rates. Even
when they’re “right” (in the same way a stopped clock is right twice per day),
they tend to fail due to being “ahead of their time”. Or if they do manage to
exploit an unexpected trend, they do it entirely accidentally – more as a
result of an absence of strategy than anything else.

Great strategies are typically great _today_ – which means they were probably
great yesterday too. And happily, unlike the future, we know what yesterday
looks like.
