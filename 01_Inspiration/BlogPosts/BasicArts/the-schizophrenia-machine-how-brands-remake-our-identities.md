I hope you find it useful, or at least interesting.

Philosophy is one of those things that lots of people like in theory, but few
like in practice. The reason for this, it seems to me, is pretty simple:

The ideas are interesting but the writing sucks.

I mean have you ever actually read any “serious” philosophy? It could be
laying out the secret to eternal life for all I know, but alas it’ll remain a
secret because the style is so dreadful. Indeed I’m pretty sure that the main
reason Marcus Aurelius is so popular these days is not because of his ideas,
but rather the fact that he’s the one philosopher who is reasonably coherent.
There is a lesson for all of us here of course: what you say is less important
than how you say it.

Anyway, despite this, philosophy’s general incoherence doesn’t prevent the odd
nugget escaping from obscurity into usefulness – and it’s just such a nugget I
wanted to introduce to you today.

It comes from [this pretty tasty YouTube
summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9srhgHzUFd4) of the work of
philosophers Deleuze, Guattari, Jameson, and Lacan (nope, me neither).
Together, they indirectly lay out a compelling theory as to how brands (and
capitalism as a whole) operate – which is useful both strategically, and as a
way of making sense of what’s going on around us.

Here I’m going to simplify it still further, and speculate on what it might
mean for us as founders, thinkers, and everyday people.

Let’s get to it.

The first level of the theory is similar to the one I laid out in my piece on
“[cultural imprinting](https://basicarts.org/cultural-imprinting-how-ads-
really-work/)”: namely that we buy brands in order to  _build our identities_.
Say, for example, we see a character that we admire in a TV show, and they’re
wearing a particular type of jacket, or drinking a certain brand of whiskey.
We might identify with that character, want to be like them, and thus buy a
similar jacket or the same drink for ourselves. In a sense then, we are
“purchasing our identity”, or at least pieces of it, in order to fill out who
we are.

So far, pretty standard stuff. Where it becomes interesting however is when we
introduce the idea of schizophrenia into the mix.

Schizophrenia can be defined (at least by Lacan and for our purposes here) as
when one has a “fragmented” identity. Rather than knowing who you are, and
having a strong sense of self, you instead are a jumble of loose, transient
characteristics, which come and go and never add up to a coherent whole.

We aren’t talking here of the medical condition necessarily, but rather
schizophrenia in an everyday colloquial sense. If, for example, you knew
someone who kept on experimenting with different identities – say being a goth
one day, then a city boy, then a yogi – we might call that behaviour
“schizophrenic”, since it is highly changeable and unfixed. It doesn’t make
them “medically ill”; just an individual messing about with their identity.
The extent to which someone has a weak or changeable sense of identity is the
extent to they are schizophrenic; and thus it’s a label that can be applied to
most of us.

As you can see then, based on this definition, a “schizophrenic” personality
is extremely good for brands, since such a personality is constantly
“shopping”, quite literally, for new identities. They represent something a
vacuum which constantly needs to be filled with new signifiers, before those
slip away only to be replaced by some more.

And these signifiers, of course, cost money.

Clothes, food, drink, holidays, cars, gadgets, tools, decorations, etc. – all
of these are things which can be pieced together to create a semi-coherent
identity.

By contrast an “anti-schizophrenic” personality – i.e. someone with a highly
fixed and extremely strong identity – is a terrible consumer. Beyond the basic
necessities of life, they don’t feel the urge to buy much, because they aren’t
try to  _construct a self_. They already have one! If you can imagine a person
with a strong, fixed, long term identity, and with certainty over who they are
and their place in the world (let’s say a monk for sake of argument), then
you’ll probably find you can’t really imagine them doing much shopping.

The bottom line here then is simple:

**Capitalism (i.e. brands) thrive in when consumers have weak, changeable
identities.**

Now here’s where it gets a bit dark.

You see it’s one thing to say that capitalism profits from this situation –
that much is clear. But it’s quite another thing to say that capitalism
_creates_ this situation – however that’s just what Jameson and pals
suggested.

**Their contention was that the consumer machine we are all living within
_actively erodes our identities_ , in order to then sell us new ones.**

When you think about it, this process is actually pretty obvious. All of the
“pieces” which have traditionally come together to form strong identities
(community, nationality, place continuity, religion, local particularity,
etc.) have been under assault for some time, and have never been weaker. We
covered this in detail in the last essay of this series on the “[post-cultural
myth](https://mailchi.mp/a67f3eb56612/boring-yourself-13461985)”; the idea
that we in the developed world are now living in a state of “cultural
neutrality”, rather than the parochial “cultural specificity” of the past.
This belief is actively encouraged by brands, media, government, etc., and is
stylistically manifested in the state of “permanent revolution” we see all
around us.

Needless to say “cultural neutrality” is another way of describing a vacuum –
or, to use our terminology here, a state of “schizophrenic instability” – the
perfect consumption environment.

Little wonder perhaps that it is so actively encouraged.
