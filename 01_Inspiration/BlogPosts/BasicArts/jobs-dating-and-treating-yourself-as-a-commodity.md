We’ve all heard of the concept of managing your “personal brand”, right?

Typically this doesn’t really mean anything more complex than managing your
reputation, but even so people tend to find it a bit “icky”, since it mixes
the impersonal language of business with the far deeper subtleties of
ourselves as human beings.

Certainly I don’t much care for it. It is kind of degrading thinking of
yourself as a commercial unit like that – but arguably it’s appropriate, since
the similarities between us and businesses are more similar than they at first
appear.

You see just like businesses we navigate a system made up of other things
similar to us, but different (i.e. other people). Just like businesses we have
a notion of success or failure within that system. And also, just like
businesses that success or failure is built on the responses of others to our
actions.

In addition to concepts like “personal brand”, we also sometimes see this
parallel being drawn with the use of the word “market”. People talk of the
“job market” and the “dating market” – recognising the dynamic similarities
between these fields and those in the commercial world.

Although this is a cold and cynical way of reading human interactions, it does
have the potential to yield valuable insights. One of the main reasons for
this is because a lot of strategic analysis has been conducted in the business
world, seeking to understand the “system dynamics” of markets. If we accept
that human systems have similar characteristics to business ones, we can
_translate_ this analysis across categories, and as a result better understand
our own behaviour and performance – as well as developing a more sophisticated
understanding of the ideas themselves.

In this piece I wanted to do just that with the idea of “commodification” –
and ask whether we, as people, can be guilty of treating _ourselves_ as
commodities, and the negative consequences that might bring.

Now although I’m sure everyone here knows what commodification and “commodity
behaviour” are in a general sense, let’s just break them down a little to get
us on the same page.

When a product is commodified that means it offers the same value as the other
products around it. As a result the only way it can succeed and get
competitive leverage is to find a way of offering “ _more for less_ ” – either
by reducing prices, giving more for the same price, or both. There are loads
of successful businesses playing the commodity game, typically via finding
economies of scale or manufacturing tricks that enable them to undercut the
competition. All we need to understand about commodification for our purposes
here however is that it basically boils down to _trying harder_. Doing what
others are doing, but somehow doing it a little bit more – through spend,
effort, whatever.

The alternative of course is differentiation: getting leverage by offering
something unique rather than more of what everyone else is offering.

Pretty straight forward stuff.

Now clearly although both approaches can be very successful, nobody would
choose commodity behaviour if they could avoid it. That’s why most strategy
involves finding paths to differentiation. However if you think about it,
you’ll see that in our own lives we often choose commodification – trying to
offer more for less – as our default position.

For example let’s examine those two “markets” we mentioned before – jobs and
dating.

When it comes to jobs, naturally most of them can be done comfortably and
effectively by a huge number of people. There isn’t “that one special person”
required to fill a given role; loads of people will do. This means therefore
that the job market has tendencies towards commodification built into it from
the start. As a result the way that most job-seekers attempt to find success
in it is predictable: they’ll treat themselves as commodities and try to offer
“more for less”:

  * They’ll make a big deal about how much they want the job, and how enthusiastic they are
  * They’ll emphasise their abilities in all the expected categories such as teamwork, attention to detail, creativity, and whatever other basic measures are expected of the role
  * They’ll signal they’re comfortable working overtime, and “going above and beyond”
  * They’ll accept a lower wage than the company may have been prepared to give under other circumstances

All of this is totally normal, just as commodification amongst businesses is
totally normal. All other things being equal, the person who “bleeds” the most
will take the prize.

However what is obvious is that, as a job-seeker, none of these measures are
particularly appealing. They all involve pain of some description. And they
all represent a power imbalance between “buyer” and “seller”. Therefore, just
like a strategic business, a strategic job-seeker may look for an alternative
in the form of differentiation.

Maybe if it’s a sales role they will have a well established relationship with
a client the business hopes to win. Maybe they will have an unusual but
relevant qualification, or skill. Maybe they come to the interview with a
particular idea they’d like to implement in the job which the company never
thought of before. Maybe they are the niece of the boss. Who knows, but the
point is that they bring a unique quality to the table that changes the game.

Suddenly effort and pain are no longer the deciding factors. Indeed maybe the
“fundamentals” of the role suddenly cease being important all together. They
have something the company wants, and the power dynamic radically shifts. In
certain circumstances the shift may be so pronounced that it is the _employer_
who becomes the commodity, not the employee. Maybe the employee has got
something so differentiated that they are simply doing the rounds in order to
sell their services to the highest bidder. Who’s taking the pain now eh?

We can see a similar dynamic _within_ organisations when it comes to
promotions. Something I noticed when I was employed was that people tended to
think that if they did a “good job” at whatever their role was, they would
eventually be rewarded with a promotion. This again is self-commoditisation,
and isn’t smart systems thinking. If you are simply doing a “good job” then
you are right where the company wants you to be. Why would they give
themselves a headache moving you somewhere else?

_(This is the root of the “Peter Principle”, a concept I adore which states
that people will get promoted to “the level of their incompetence”. In other
words people will continually get promoted out of roles they’re good at until
they hit a role they’re bad at, where they’ll stay indefinitely. A company
that falls for this trap is, in theory, destined to have poor performers in
every role – hence their well justified wariness in promoting people just
because they’re doing a “good job”)_

Ironically the people most ripe for promotion are not those who are a perfect
fit for their current role, but those who are an _awkward_ fit. Those who are
doing something a bit aberrant which would have a more natural fit at a higher
level – even if they are perhaps “worse” at their job than others around them.

In other words, those pursuing a differentiation strategy, rather than
commodification.

How about dating?

Well, whilst I’ll be the first to admit that using such language in this more
emotional context is extra-icky, once again we find that self-commoditisation
is common.

People attempt to offer more for less by doing things such as:

  * Spending lots of money on dates and gifts (money, in business and personal affairs, should always be seen as a proxy for blood and toil)
  * Making themselves super available
  * Agreeing with everything the other person says regardless of their true opinions
  * Etc.

Although a degree of this stuff is simply positive romantic behaviour (just as
a degree of enthusiasm for a job is also desirable) you can see how when it
becomes the _primary_ point of leverage in an interaction it can tip over into
self-damaging territory – becoming not only effortful, but potentially
counter-productive (i.e. unattractive).

You don’t have to be some sort of love guru to recognise that…

The bottom line of all this is that no matter what the field, offering more
for less is rarely the smartest way to go. Aside from it being costly to you –
in terms of money, pain, or dignity – you’ll inevitably find that your limits
are pretty similar to everyone else’s. And even if they aren’t, you’ll
probably still be outmanoeuvred by someone offering differentiation.

Every penny you spend, every late night you pull, every drop of sweat and
every pride swallowing moment – all of these are signals. Signals that in
whatever system you’re participating, _you are the commodity_ – and you’re
having to make up for lack of differentiation in some form or another.

On the other hand in those parts of your life that seem easy, where things
just seem to happen for you, and that you barely have to think about? Those
are the places where you are differentiated. Where you have some form of
leverage that’s doing all the hard work for you, and allowing you to simply
cruise.
