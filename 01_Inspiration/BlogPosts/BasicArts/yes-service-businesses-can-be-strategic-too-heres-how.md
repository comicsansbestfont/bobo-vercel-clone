These days the most common question I get asked is something along these
lines:

_“Hey, I like your stuff, but you’re always talking about product businesses –
what about people like me with service businesses, how do we do it?”._

Typically these are people with businesses like:

  * Law firms
  * Accountancy practices
  * Advertising agencies

…anything where you’re selling time rather than a “thing”.

Now, it is true, my explanations tend to favour product businesses. But this
isn’t because they’re the only ones who can do great strategy – it’s simply
because they’re more famous and so help me land my point easier.

Generally the answer I give to the above is something like this:

_“There is no difference between any type of business. The game is always the
same. Bring new value to your industry, connect it with what your customers
want, and reap the rewards”._

…but I’ll admit this isn’t super helpful.

The fact is that true strategic differentiation **_is_** harder for service
businesses, for the simple reason that they are chameleonic. They have to
respond to customer briefs, which means they basically have to become a
“different business” for every client depending on what’s been asked for.

In this situation it’s super hard to get tight and specific and be about “one
thing” – because the business will always respond “OK… but what if someone
comes and asks us for something else? We’re not gonna just turn it away,
right?”.

**This is why, as many have observed, branding agencies have shit branding.
They just don’t want to be pinned down – when strategy is all about being
pinned down!**

But look, I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently. After all, I have a
service business. And there are some service businesses in the Inner Circle of
the [Strategy Shortcut System](http://www.strategyshortcutsystem.com), so
we’ve been digging into it.

And I’ve come up with a few techniques that I think make strategy easier for
service businesses.

Check them out:

**Niching**

This is the obvious one that most service businesses try, and honestly I don’t
like it. This is where you say something like “we’ll be web developers for
dentists”, or something like that. It can work, but it’s unimaginative, it
needlessly compresses your market, and often your target customer actually
doesn’t _want_ a specialist anyway. Proceed with caution.

**Thingification**

This is something I’ve done a lot in my career. You say you don’t have
“products”? Well that’s easy to fix. Just look at things you’re doing already
for customers, codify them, slap a name on them, and hey presto what was a
“service” becomes a “product”. When something has a name and a systematised
process it gives the appearance of a proprietary innovation – even if “under
the hood” it’s kinda similar to what all your competitors are doing, but
without labelling it.

**Delivery medium**

You’ve heard “the medium is the message” right? Well the same thing applies to
service businesses. Just changing the medium by which you deliver your
services will dramatically change the way it lands for the customer. This is
what I’m doing with [my product](http://www.strategyshortcutsystem.com).
There’s a course element, a tool element, a community element, and a group
coaching element. However the actual “service” being rendered here is _the
same_ as the service I offer for $100,000 to an ordinary consulting client.
It’s just the medium is different, unlocking a whole new form of value.

**Trojan horse**

One of the guys in the group coined this term – which in the past I’ve called
“context shift”, but I like his version better. Here you take your service,
but rather than selling it to people who are looking for that service (highly
competitive), you instead enter _another_ market where people are looking for
something different, but where your service is still relevant. They think
they’re buying X, but they’re actually buying Y. A basic example might be a
sales consultant targeting people who are shopping for websites – knowing that
their desire for a new website is really a desire for more sales. Thus you
bring a new skill to that stale market.

**Personal brand**

OK this one is kinda cheating in a way, but it’s a huge lever for service
businesses so we’ve gotta mention it. Quite simply if you (or someone in your
team) is a bit of a “celebrity” in your field, things are going to come _so
much easier_. (Take it from me!). I frankly don’t understand service
businesses who don’t try and exploit this. If you’re a subject matter expert
it’s not hard to create content about it, and there are fantastic support
resources available for all the technical stuff. To produce a video [like
this](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFYYQyXIy9p/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)
only costs a couple of hundred bucks (if that) when you’ve set it all up. The
trick or course is to ensure you have an original point of view.

These are just off the top of my head, but hopefully you can see that even as
a service business you have plenty of options to:

  * Innovate
  * Get specific
  * And build meaningful differentiation

You just have to break out of the box in your head.

Now if you have a service business that is doing more than $1m in business a
year I want to help you do this. Together we can create a vision beyond the
grimy “billable hours” treadmill, and build something more scalable,
impactful, and fun.
