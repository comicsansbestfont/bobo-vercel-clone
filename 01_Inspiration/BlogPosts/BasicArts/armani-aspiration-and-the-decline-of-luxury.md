If we’re reductive about it, we might say there are really only two strategic
levers a business can pull from a consumer perspective:

When it comes to delivering value, these are basically the paths to do it.
Utilitarian companies offer a genuinely useful and unique “function” – for
instance, the supermarket Lidl, and its low prices. Meanwhile, brand-led
companies make up for their lack of differentiated function with a brand image
people want to be associated with or buy into – e.g. Nike, and their powerful
cultural innovation we explored [here](https://basicarts.org/nike-and-the-
concept-of-cultural-innovation/).

This isn’t to say that founders should pick one or the other. The [greatest
brands](https://basicarts.org/nike-and-the-concept-of-cultural-innovation/) do
both simultaneously; using utilitarian difference to support a branded
proposition (Steve Jobs era Apple is a perfect example of a 50/50 split
between these two directions, hence why it is so revered). Typically however
the balance will be skewed in one direction or another. Whilst I would never
suggest that Lidl has no brand power, I think it’s fairly safe to assume that
if its brand was totally different, but its prices were the same, it wouldn’t
suffer much damage.

Now, whilst utilitarian offerings are easy to understand – the company does a
job that solves a particular issue – branded ones are a bit more subtle. To
the cynic, they are exercises in selling people essentially “nothing”. Just a
chimera, wrapped around a generic overpriced item or service. However, as I
think we all know here, there is “real value” in brand. It does indeed have
the capacity to give people something they are looking for – just as much as
more tangible offerings like “low prices” or “fast delivery”. And, if we were
to pick a word that summarises that value, we would probably alight here:

#### **Aspiration**.

Yes, that old chestnut. What brand on the planet doesn’t want to be seen as
“aspirational”? Paradoxically even the low-priced ones are at it (other than
perhaps Ryan Air, whose anti-aspiration stance is what makes them so damn
cool).

So universal is this desire in fact that it has become cliche. I’ve always
said that a good test of whether a goal is worth stating is if the _opposite_
would be equally plausible – a test which “aspirational” clearly doesn’t pass.

However, as with many cliches, just because everyone agrees on it doesn’t mean
that everyone understands it. To create something with an “aspirational”
quality is actually quite tricky. It is tempting to view the characteristic as
being analogous with “premium” – whereby each category might have its
“aspirational option”, that being the more expensive and high-quality one.
However in reality the dynamics of aspiration are far more subtle than that –
as evidenced by a recent phenomenon we might call “luxury erosion”.

Luxury erosion – a term I just made up, but it will do – is the process by
which various premium and luxury brands have gradually drifted from
aspirational to “anti-aspirational” over the course of the past decade or two.
For a basic example, think of the brand Armani. Undoubtedly this is a luxury
“aspirational” brand, and yet it some respects it has come to represent
something of the opposite, at least in the hyper-developed West. If you see a
person walking down the street wearing a t-shirt with a big Armani logo
emblazoned on the front, you will, I suggest, not be liable to look up to them
so much as to look down on them. Such a display has come to be seen as a bit
gauche, a bit declassé. In a different manner, the same fate has befallen the
iconic luxury car trio: Mercedes, BMW, and Audi. Again these brands were once
seen as archetypal symbols of aspiration and success, and yet now that sense
has faded. For many they are now gently derided as “rep mobiles” – or in the
case of Mercedes in particular, “taxis” (given how regularly that brand is now
used for that purpose). This isn’t to say that these brands aren’t still
desired in various ways; just that they have lost a lot of the caché they
enjoyed in the 90s.

Wherever you look, you can see various iconic luxury brands suffering the same
fate – losing their allure and becoming if not anti-aspirational then at the
very least ordinary.

How can we explain this drift? And moreover, how can we decipher aspiration in
a manner which allows us to harness its effects for our own brand?

To do this there is one very simple principle I think we should cleave to:

**As material comfort increases, and societies become more “developed”,
aspirational status markers become increasingly ethereal.**

Here’s a scientific graph to make the point:

![the decline of
luxury](https://mcusercontent.com/dbfcfcd097fd0818275a2b8b8/images/77047daa-9ff5-5be2-caa3-b0b0f97f410d.jpeg)

What does this mean?

Well when we say something is aspirational, we mean that it raises our social
status. It is something we perceive as being above our current status, and
therefore by associating with it we might pull ourselves up to a higher level
on the ladder. Clearly, we are all constantly, unavoidably, and largely
subconsciously jostling for status, and this jostle is what all brand-led
businesses basically rely on.

What the above graph is about is that the things that have the power to confer
status are highly variable depending on cultural context. A high-status thing
in an Amazonian village is not going to be the same as a high-status thing in
New York City, that goes without saying. This variability is not random,
however. It’s highly predictable. _And it’s predictable in the way that it
always follows the path of becoming less obvious, more subtle, more ethereal
as development progresses._

To illustrate this, think about the concept of “bling”. Bling, I think it’s
fair to say, is very unfashionable in the hyper-developed West. However, in
cultures that have a more recent history of hardship and deprivation, bling is
highly fashionable. The tastes of wealthy Russians, Chinese, and Africans is
not the same as wealthy Northern Europeans and Americans. It tends to be more
ostentatious and glitzy – and this makes sense given the historical backdrop.
If you are emerging from 50 years of Communist rule, say, it will be
impressive to display material excess since few of your peers have access to
it. If however, you live in a society where material excess is available to
pretty much anyone, you have to look elsewhere to prove your position at the
top of the social pile.

This explains the erosion that has befallen Armani and Mercedes. In the 1990s
they were flawless status symbols and powerfully aspirational since they were
undeniably brands few people could access. As time has rolled on, however, and
they’ve become more accessible, they’ve gradually lost that power – taking us
to the point we’re at today where they are pretty easy for ordinary people to
buy into if they so choose. At such a point to flaunt these things ceases to
be impressive, and actually becomes self-damaging, as it suggests that you are
coming from a position that reveres such symbols; a position the culture
around you has moved on from.

Clearly, this division doesn’t only occur across national boundaries, but
within them too. Different social classes have different ideas of what’s
aspirational for precisely the same reasons. Luxury brand names used to be
common in hip-hop lyrics because the art arose from a deprived backdrop. By
the same token, we can see why Tony Soprano wears a gold chain, watch, and
rings, but the chairman of the World Bank does not.

#### **Wherever you look the pattern repeats: as wealth and status go up, a
taste for glitz goes down.**

Understanding this then, we might well wonder what aspirational looks like in
a social milieu that looks down on such obvious “premium” markers. We all
understand the idea that Magnum, say, is a premium ice cream because it’s a
bit more expensive, uses fancy gold typography and yammers on about indulgence
all the time. But if this is no longer seen as aspirational – and in fact is
seen as a little gauche – then what is?

One clue we can find is in the relentless ascension of “Scandic-style”: the
fashion for the clean, minimalist, and “tasteful” (note that it is only
considered tasteful due to the social position of the tastemakers). It’s a
look that says “I’ve got nothing to prove”, and perhaps at a deeper level “I
have the means to curate and standardise my aesthetic life”. The [blanding
phenomenon](https://basicarts.org/downloads/battle-of-the-blands-strategic-
ways-to-make-your-brand-stand-out/) is, in a way, a Scandification of consumer
goods. Removal of all traces of showiness or idiosyncrasy, to produce
something which blends seamlessly with the carefully managed environments of
the tastemaker classes. Looking like you’re not trying to flaunt your power
has become the standard power-play: an extension of the hoodie and sneakers
uniform we’ve come to expect of tech billionaires, now writ large.

Connected to this is the trend for infantilisation of products – or what we in
the UK might call “Innocentification”, in honour of the pioneer, Innocent
drinks. This generally isn’t found in fashion but is common in consumer goods
and technology, whereby the most premium option is often that which looks the
most “childlike”. I’ve had various food and beverage clients who wished to be
seen as premium, and thought that “luxury” would be the path by which they
could best achieve this; however, I’ve always had to point out that perhaps
the two most premium brands in the supermarket at the moment are Innocent and
Ben & Jerry’s: the two most self-consciously _unluxurious_ ones.

Part of the reason infantilised brands are seen as aspirational is their
connection with virtuous behaviour, which leads me to a more profound status
marker that has emerged recently: “luxury beliefs”.

A term coined by sociologist Rob Henderson, luxury beliefs are social and
political opinions that are typically only held by those of very high status,
and as such has come to be wielded in the same ostentatious way that gold
jewellery would have been in the past. What enables them to be “luxury” is:

  1. Being highly non-intuitive, meaning they can’t be “sensed” but rather must be learned through extensive education (e.g. “stealing is wrong” is not a luxury belief because it’s intuitive; whereas “stealing is actually right” would be a luxury belief if you could support it with some convoluted academic scaffolding)
  2. Being fast-moving, meaning they change all the time so you have to keep on top of them, thus displaying that you’ve got your finger on the pulse (a hard-working Joe Schmo won’t be able to keep pace with academic fashions, and thus will quickly out themselves as a rube when they display outmoded opinions and vocabulary)
  3. Being financially costly to hold; thereby showing that costs are something you are able to bear (those in relative poverty are forced to place their own material concerns higher in their priorities than those at the top, who are able to be more idealistic)

A typical example might be a commitment to the total dissolution of national
borders: a view which effectively no ordinary people hold, but which is quite
common in the highest echelons of society and certainly acts as a strong
status indicator.

Away from such hyper-elite views like this, the luxury beliefs phenomenon can
be seen in [strategy](https://basicarts.org/) through the continued ascendancy
of ethical offerings. Although the things most ethical brands stand for don’t
fully meet the definition of luxury beliefs, they do nevertheless tap into one
of the main aspirational currents in post-luxury societies such as the UK and
USA. While the 90s millionaire would have bragged about his sweater being made
from cashmere, the 20s millionaire would do so about hemp. The motivations are
the same, the content changes.

To simply make something premium does not work, because premium has become
democratised. To stretch people out of their social strata today, you have to
find new paths.

This job is much harder than in the days when you simply used swirly gold font
and charged 20% more than your competitors. It requires far more insight and
cultural nous. But for those who achieve it, the rewards are exponentially
higher.
