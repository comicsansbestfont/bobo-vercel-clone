When I want to make a point about strategy, I often refer to a famous brand in
order to do it. So does everyone of course, and because there are so few
brands out there who are strategically interesting, the same names always get
repeated.

To be honest I always feel a bit embarrassed to mention the usual suspects in
pieces like this, because even if you’re making an original point, a well-worn
case study can immediately make it feel cliched. However there’s no denying
that they’re useful: clear, vibrant, and more importantly, familiar.

There is however one iconic brand who I basically never reference, and that is
Nike.

Despite being arguably the _ultimate_ case study cliche (behind perhaps
Apple), Nike never struck me as being especially strategically interesting. Or
perhaps more accurately, I simply didn’t have good grasp of what their key
strategic play was.

Well, thanks to a book sent to me by a reader (thanks Greg), I now know their
back story – and it’s interesting enough to pass comment on.

The book is [_Cultural Strategy_](https://www.amazon.com/Cultural-Strategy-
Innovative-Ideologies-
Breakthrough/dp/0199655855/ref=sr_1_1?crid=38ACGT6KGXGXG&dchild=1&keywords=cultural+strategy+holt&qid=1605179166&sprefix=cultural+strategy%2Caps%2C304&sr=8-1)
by Douglas Holt and Douglas Cameron, wherein the authors discuss a concept
they call “cultural innovation”. Cultural innovation is essentially the idea
that a brand can open up clear market space not only through _functional_
innovation (i.e. providing improved or novel performance), but by representing
a new _ideology_ within its market. Brands who pursue this second approach
don’t necessarily need to have any meaningful functional differences with
their competitors _at all_ – they simply need to stand for an arresting and
motivating cultural position which is deeply at odds with the status quo.

I’ve never really bothered to draw this distinction between functional
innovation and cultural innovation before, instead preferring to talk about
the new _value_ a business brings to the market. For me it’s clear that this
value can be either functional, cultural, or ideally both – however on
reflection I do think it’s useful to pay some special attention to the
cultural side of the equation because it’s rather more subtle than the
functional.

It can be hard to talk about _pure_ cultural innovation, because most of the
great brands do both. Apple we might say represented an extremely powerful
combination of both cultural and functional innovation – whereby they made
computers non-nerdy, accessible, and tools for creative expression (cultural),
which they then backed up with radical design, UX, and product innovations
(functional). Perfect. Nike, on the other hand, give us the ultimate example
of a purely cultural and ideological strategic play.

In short, when Nike came to prominence in the 70s, they and all other athletic
apparel companies were embracing the same category norm: a focus on
performance and winning. Typical of this expression would be an attempt to
build associations with top athletes and their moments of victory (thus
implying that the shoe or whatever played a big part in it).

What was somewhat different about Nike was their background, specifically in
running. Running, unlike other sports, was individualist and somewhat
masochistic. Phil Knight, Nike’s founder, was himself an accomplished track
athlete – and he understood this culture better than anyone. Running often
doesn’t have a glorious moment of victory (for example when you’re jogging);
it is simply a solitary process which requires discipline and fortitude.

This individualistic mindset, and focus on the _struggle_ associated with
sport, rather than the moment of glory, laid the foundations for Nike’s
cultural revolution and product strategy. Whilst other brands would typically
advertise a sneaker with an athlete triumphantly crossing the finish line,
Nike would instead choose to focus on the athlete’s 5am morning routine:
getting up in the dead of winter, and putting in the miles no matter what. By
and by “Just Do It” emerged as the call to arms of this philosophy; go through
the struggle, no matter how tough.

Needless to say this focus on overcoming obstacles rather than simply “being
great” was seen as being applicable to all sorts of wider issues beyond
competitive sport.

Their first iconic ad featured a real octogenarian San Francisco resident who
ran across the Golden Gate Bridge every day before swimming in the bay. Many
of their subsequent ads emphasised the most unglamorous elements of training;
pain, poor weather, and the like. Latterly they leant heavily on the struggle
of urban kids trying to use sports to leave the projects, and on female
athletes struggling for recognition, and even on overweight people (not the
typical ambassadors for a sports brand) taking that first step to better
health.

In short, Nike became the brand for anyone who wanted to be associated with
taking matters into your own hands, and overcoming obstacles. This stood in
stark contrast to the more upbeat but fundamentally shallow and demotivational
positions of their competitors, who stood by their “this shoe will make you
play better” ideologies.

As you can gather, cultural innovation is an extremely _brand oriented_ type
of product strategy. It is, largely, superficial. Unless you go for the
blended approach of cultural + functional, you will not be building any
concrete walls between yourself and your competitors. However, as the Nike
strategy has proven, that doesn’t necessarily negate the power of the approach
if done with sufficient skill.

Would I recommend it?

For most brands I probably wouldn’t, frankly. The problem with it is that, due
to its superficiality, it looks far easier than it actually is. I’m pretty
sure that all branding agencies _believe_ they are engaging in cultural
innovation (even if they don’t call it that) when they work on a project – but
clearly vanishingly few actually are. That’s because cultural innovation
requires actual _innovation_. That means it must put forward an ideology which
is in _opposition to the orthodoxy_. And naturally very few brands have the
guts for that.

What I see most brands doing is in fact the opposite. They set up “straw man”
orthodoxies to push against, and then act like they are doing something brave
and counter-cultural, when in fact they are leaning deeply into establishment
tropes. They think they are acting like Nike, or Ben & Jerry’s, or Apple, or
any of the other successful cultural innovators because they are _copying_
them – without realising that those brands were only innovators because they
went against the orthodoxy of their times, and did so so successfully that
they made their own positions orthodox. **In fact we can put the continued
success of these brands today precisely down to them representing the
establishment** – which of course is a great place to be if you can get it.

In truth a modern Nike would in many ways have to be the anti-Nike. It would
need to put forward an ideology like:

  *     * Talented people only need apply; elitist message; we don’t need to struggle because we’re too good
    * Or win at all costs; win ugly
    * Or focus on showmanship and style, not the result
    * Or something about ease and effortlessness

Any of these would be _far more_ counter cultural than anything in the pious
territory of overcoming obstacles. I have noticed that occasionally Adidas
have flirted with some positions approaching these; which suggests to me there
are some smart cookies behind the scenes there – and sure enough they have
performed extremely well in recent years.

Anyway, overall I think it’s a worthwhile exercise to consider your current
balance of functional vs. cultural innovation, and whether it needs
readdressing.

If you’re a functional innovator, can you follow the thread of your
innovations to reveal a consequent cultural innovation? And if you’re a
cultural innovator (you probably aren’t, but you never know!), can you follow
that thread to a functional one?

One thing’s for sure: due to the process of
[concentration](https://us16.campaign-
archive.com/?u=dbfcfcd097fd0818275a2b8b8&id=32293af9e4) I wrote about
recently, cultural innovators are becoming rarer and rarer. So potentially
there are some spoils to be had.
