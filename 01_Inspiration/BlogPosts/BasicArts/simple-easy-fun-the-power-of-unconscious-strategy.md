I routinely say that the vast majority of businesses “don’t have a strategy”,
but if I’m honest, that’s not entirely accurate.

In reality all businesses do, in fact, have a strategy. It’s just that for
most of them it’s  _unconscious_.

An “unconscious strategy” might seem like a contradiction in terms, given that
a strategy is a deliberate way of coordinating actions. And certainly it will
inevitably be much woolier than a conscious one. But they do nevertheless
exist.

The way to identify such a thing, is to intuit it by observing the  _sum of
the decisions_ that a business takes.

In a business with a  _conscious_ strategy, the strategy determines the
decisions, like this:

**Conscious strategy — > decisions**

In a business with an unconscious strategy that process is reversed, with the
seemingly random decisions coming together to define a strategy that nobody’s
really aware of, like this:

**Sum of decisions — > unconscious strategy**

In theory you could go into any business, look at all the decisions they’ve
made, bundle them together, and summarise them into a strategic direction that
has been (unconsciously) followed up to that point. Some deep network of
assumptions and prejudices that are driving choices from the depths of the
founder’s mind. It’s all about pattern recognition. It’s highly unlikely that
the decisions will be so random and divergent that there will be  _no_
discernible pattern to them. There will always be subtle decision making
framework that has been followed, even if the people involved didn’t realise
they were doing it.

Now, we might well ask: is an unconscious strategy a good thing?

Clearly it’s not “proper” strategy, so you might expect me to say no, however
I do think it can have a surprising, even “magical” power.

For one thing, in the case of a business which has no conscious strategy but
is doing really well, we can probably conclude that their unconscious strategy
is the right strategy. After all it’s doing the job, no? In such cases
strategy development essentially boils down to observing what the business is
doing  _unconsciously_ , and making it  _conscious_. Bringing it from darkness
into light. Such an exercise doesn’t really require too much speculative
thinking at all – it’s really just a question of observation.

When you do that, you will of course find that quite a few decisions you’ve
made weren’t in fact aligned even with the unconscious strategy. Perhaps only
60% of them were – after all it’s only a  _tendency_ we’re talking about
there. But that’s no problem, because now you’re conscious of it, you can
correct those errors and pull everything into alignment.

So that’s the obvious benefit of a decent unconscious strategy.

**What’s perhaps even more intriguing than this however, is the potential to
pursue a _deliberate unconscious strategy_.**

This is even more paradoxical than mere unconscious strategy, but allow me to
explain.

A friend of mine runs a small coaching business that is doing really well. One
day we were talking about it, and he told me something that really made me
think:

“At the end of the day, all my business partner and I really do when we’re
making decisions is to ask ‘is this simple, easy, and fun?’ – if it isn’t, we
just don’t do it, and one way or another things work out”.

This sounds like the opposite of all the advice we typically get about working
hard, following best practice, doing the “smart” thing, and so on – but I
believe there’s a deep truth here. By only doing things they consider to be
“simple, easy, and fun”, my friend and his business partner have been able to
intuitively guide their business to places where their  _expertise matches a
market need_. They never drift into territory that is overly competitive, as
that wouldn’t be “easy”. They never do anything that they aren’t good at, as
that wouldn’t be “simple”. And they never waver from their heart-felt sense of
purpose, as that wouldn’t be “fun”.

Simple. Easy. Fun. This is a recipe for deliberate unconscious strategy. They
don’t have a prescribed “proper” strategy to follow that is making their
decisions for them; so they couldn’t really quite tell you what they’re doing.
But nevertheless they are behaving in a manner that maximises their chances of
making strategically sound decisions in the absence of a proper strategy.

At some point they’ll be able to take a step back, analyse the things they’ve
done, and the strategy will reveal itself to them – allowing them to proceed
more confidently, and to accelerate their growth.

For those of you who are into this kind of thing, you’ll probably recognise
that what I’m talking about here is essentially a Daoist approach. It’s a
method of connecting with the “universal flow” rather than fighting against
it. Although this sounds very woo-woo, it is fundamentally the way strategy
works: by finding the path of least resistance in the world around you and
submitting to it, the way that water conforms itself to the mountainside to
find the smoothest path downhill.

If I’m honest this is a technique I use as well, despite my belief in
“conscious strategy”. For instance I’ve found that it’s not possible for me to
deliberately “engineer” new business opportunities in a textbook linear
fashion. Instead it’s much more effective for me to simply go out into the
world and be helpful in an open-hearted manner, and trust that it will deliver
results in a mysterious and unpredictable way.

And it has.

Now, let’s get it straight, this is not me repudiating proper conscious
strategy. I’m not saying that every business should just go with the flow and
everything will be OK. This approach really only works with very small one or
two-person businesses, where you don’t need to coordinate a team or multiple
moving parts. The moment a business grows beyond this, unconscious strategy
(even of the best and most deliberate variety) will begin to unravel and
display its contradictions. At that point you need a way of coordinating
everyone’s decisions, and so unless you’re able to develop a sort of “psychic
hive-mind” with your team, that’s going to require a formal strategy.

Still, until you reach that point, I think perhaps you should be more “heart
led” with your decisions than you might think. There is a deeper wisdom to
“simple, easy, fun” than meets the eye. And it goes well beyond what we are
able to rationally grasp.
