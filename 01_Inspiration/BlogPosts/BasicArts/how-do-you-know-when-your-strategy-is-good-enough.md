I’m going to let you in on a little secret:

_You don’t actually need your strategy to be particularly good._

Yes, we’d all love to achieve the elegant brilliance of a Southwest, or an
IKEA, but being real that’s probably not gonna happen. There’s a reason why
people talk about those same case studies over and over again – it’s because
they represent something that’s _rare_.

No, for you and me, mediocre will probably do.

After all, given that the mean standard out there is _no strategy_ , even
something that’s “strategy-ish” will put you ahead, and so we shouldn’t demean
that. Strategy-ish is great in the grand scheme of things.

We also need to be mindful that there are good reasons why a truly brilliant
strategy will be out of reach for most businesses:

  1. For many, they simply don’t have enough to work with. Their raw materials lack potential. They are, if we’re honest, kinda vacant. And there’s a limit to what you can do with that, short of basically building a new business from the ground up.
  2. For many others, they simply don’t have the stomach for it. No amount of stirring speeches from me or anyone else is going to change that. Like I said last week, great strategy means _increasing_ risk, and there’s nothing wrong with not wanting to do that!
  3. And finally, most obviously, maybe you just can’t think of a good idea. This stuff is hard. You’re trying to uncover an angle with massive market potential, and yet which everyone else has somehow overlooked. The chances of achieving that in a really uncompromised way aren’t great.

So here I want to celebrate and explain mediocre strategy.

Strategy that’s “good enough”. Strategy you can work with (even if nobody’s
going to write any case studies about it). And strategy that, realistically,
should satisfy the vast majority of brands and founders.

What does that kind of strategy look like?

Here are the benchmarks.

## I. It’s a pure marketing play

Great strategy manifests in the creation of a truly unique business, at the
core operational level. It’s about _doing_ something different, not just
_saying_ something different. That’s how you create genuine daylight between
yourself and your competitors.

Mediocre strategy on the other hand tends to only go skin-deep. It’s a
glorified comms exercise, more than a company creation one.

This indeed is why many people get confused by the difference between
“strategy”, and things like “value proposition” or “positioning” or
“marketing”. They are actually quite similar, except that the latter three
tend to stop at presentation, whereas full-blooded strategy takes _everything_
under its remit. It’s about creating the thing rather than describing the
thing.

Now, the truth is that skin-deep strategy actually can be very effective. If
you find a fresh and coherent way to pitch a fundamentally generic product,
that’s great! And if you execute artfully and consistently over time, you will
start to build the _perception_ of true difference, which is almost as good as
the real thing.

So if the story is great, but you can’t really think of any hard ways of
executing it… maybe it’s good enough.

## II. Competitors _can_ do it, but don’t focus on it

Ideally with strategy we want to find a way to offer something that our
competitors _literally_ can’t – even if they tried. That’s how you reach the
nirvana of “anti-competitive” status, and everything flows effortlessly.

But like I said, that’s tough, so perhaps we can settle for the next best
thing: doing something your competitors _can_ do, but don’t focus on.

For example all car brands can reasonably claim to be “comfortable”. It’s not
really an ownable space. But that said, I can’t think of any who aggressively
focus on it, and so in that respect someone could take loose control of that
area if they really tried.

Like the first point, this approach will largely be a marketing play – but you
can also start to build some mild forms of true differentiation, purely by
pouring all your energies into something which is only a secondary concern for
everybody else.

So don’t necessarily despair if your offer isn’t genuinely unique… it may just
be good enough too.

## III. Regardless of content, it delivers team clarity

Do not underestimate the power of making things clear, simple, and aligned –
even if the thing you’re aligning around is kinda feeble.

Honestly just by getting your whole team to sing from the same hymn sheet
you’ll see returns, and this can be done through strategic ideas with no
leverage at all.

One of the big biz success stories out there who used this is Zappos, an
online shoe retailer. I don’t like to talk about them because I think their
“angle” is super boring and unimaginative: “great customer service”. Ugh. But
fair play to them, they embraced it so completely and coherently that it built
a true sense of vitality in the organisation that then seeped through to
market results.

At the end of the day strategy is just as much an internal-comms and
leadership tool as it is anything else, so when you understand that you can
see that merely “tidying things up” can have massive benefit.

So, if your people seem to like and understand something which doesn’t have
real strategic teeth behind it… maybe that’s OK, maybe that’s good enough as
well.

## IV. It contains at least ONE sacrifice

I’m not going to let you off totally scot-free here. I’m not going to give you
license to proceed with something that is genuinely pure waffle. There has to
be _some_ substance.

And the best way of ensuring that?

Make sure that you’re clear on at least one desirable or lucrative thing that
the strategy makes you give up, or forbids you from doing.

If you embrace the marketing-led approach _too much_ , then you’re likely to
stray into “unleash the incredible” kinda bullshit territory, where there is
so little specificity that literally anything goes, and you’ve made no
decision at all.

Understand there _must_ always be a decision of some sort – which means saying
yes to something, and no to something else.

So what are you saying no to? If there is at least something – and that
something is quite appealing – then maybe you’ve hit the magical threshold of
good enough.

____

There you have it. Strategy that is watered down so much that anyone can do
it, without the need for much courage or intelligence.

This might not sound super inspiring, but the beauty is that even when framed
like this, most people _still_ won’t do it. Most people will still let things
be an utterly incoherent reactive mess.

And that, ultimately, is why it’s good enough. Because in the land of the
blind, the one-eyed man is king.
