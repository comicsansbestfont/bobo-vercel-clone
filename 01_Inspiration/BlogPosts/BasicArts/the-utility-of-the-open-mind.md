If you ever read a book on creativity, you will find a recurring theme: the
muse.

It will be talked about in varying ways, but the central idea is generally the
same: that rather than coming up with ideas ourselves, they are instead
“given” to us by an outside force (the muse, the universe, God, whatever), and
we act as nothing but a conduit for its wishes. According to this theory, we
might say our brain is somewhat like a radio – it tunes into messages that are
floating around us in the ether, and a “creative person” is merely someone who
is _receptive_ to them, and allows them to flow through their consciousness
and onto the page. In other words the creative person “creates” nothing at
all.

As Piet Mondrian said:

“The position of the artist is humble. He is essentially a channel”.

Do you believe this? Quite possibly not. If you aren’t spiritually inclined
then it’s hard to see how you could swallow such a concept. As such you may be
inclined to dismiss the idea altogether – which is a shame because, true or
not, this idea has apparently worked for the greatest creative minds in
history. Experience suggests that, however, the process “actually” works on a
neurological level, acting _as if it works_ indeed brings results. This leaves
the dismissive sceptic at a profound disadvantage.

Personally, I love this idea, because it neatly illustrates a little-discussed
tension that we must embrace if we are to become effective decision-makers.
That is:

_We don’t have to know how something works in order to embrace it._

In pretty much every field outside of pure mechanics, systems are too complex
for us to decipher completely. We might isolate something true at a micro
level, but miss thousands of other contributing factors which add up to a
functioning whole.

This kind of reductive thinking, where instead of trusting things based on
their _results_ , we trust them based on our _understanding of their
processes_ , has plagued modern thinking. It has led to us replacing many
things that work well-but-mysteriously with things that work poorly-but-
understandably, with predictably corrosive results.

If you want a topical example of this, it’s interesting to note how the
coronavirus pandemic has led to sharp revisionism on the subject of sun
exposure. For decades we’ve been assured – against all common sense – that on
balance, sunlight is bad for us. “Wear sunscreen”, so said Baz Luhrmann, “the
long-term benefits of which have been proven by scientists”. Of course in a
one-dimensional manner, this is true – excessive sun exposure can cause skin
cancer. But in the macro it has proven to be horribly false, for many reasons
but not least the connection between vitamin-D deficiency and immune system
impairment (it has been found that corona mortality correlates strongly with
low vitamin-D levels). It has even been suggested that sun avoidance
_increases the likelihood of skin cancer_ – because spending 50 weeks of the
year hiding from it and then 2 weeks on vacation in the blazing rays is far
more “stressful” on the skin than simply spending time in the sun
consistently. The relationship isn’t linear.

Needless to say, I’m not here to make a case for sun exposure or even to
defend the above claims (not my field) – I only use it to illustrate the
principle: what we understand and what works are not the same things.

Another example of this phenomenon which I find very entertaining, and useful
at least at an intellectual level if not a practical one is that of “proxy
structures”. A proxy structure is the name I give to “made up” narratives
which we use to explain things that somehow exist, but we don’t understand.
The muse, for instance, is a proxy structure. Assuming she doesn’t “literally
exist” in a formal way, she is an explanatory vessel for helping us tap into
something that _does exist_ , but which we don’t understand well enough to
ossify into scientific language. Maybe it’s just the way the brain works, or
maybe it’s something more mystical; either way, it doesn’t matter. Either way,
the muse is a stand-in for something real. A further proxy structure might be
astrology. However sceptical we might be about astrology, the one thing we
have to admit is that it has proven incredibly durable, and remarkably cross
cultural for thousands of years. Because of this we might infer that there is
“something” there, even if that something in reality bears no relation to the
proxy structure we use to describe it. It’s like picking up a faint scent of
something in another room, and building a whole mythology around that thing
without ever actually knowing what it is. The mythology may be completely off
base, but it at least _acknowledges_ the smell, rather than dismissing it out
of hand.

Getting comfortable with this general idea is essential for [strategic
thinking](https://basicarts.org/newsletter/), and effective decision making in
general. Why? Because, if we’re honest, strategies are proxy structures
themselves.

Strategies are pleasing stories we tell ourselves which make sense of complex
webs of relationships well beyond the grasp of our understanding. They don’t
represent the “truth” any more literally than the muse does, or with any more
scientific rigour than the vague notion that sunlight is good for us. But,
like those things, they give us a direction of travel with a happy ending –
which really is all there is to it no?

This means that the most crucial attribute for a
[strategist](https://basicarts.org/) to have is not intellect, or experience,
or knowledge, but simply an open mind. An open mind, to me, is not one that is
willing to believe anything it hears – but it is willing to _entertain_
anything it hears. An open mind doesn’t demand official approval before it
will engage with something, but is instead able to engage with it on a
_conceptual_ level out of pure intellectual curiosity. It doesn’t scoff at,
say, a ghost story, but thinks “wow, how interesting that you believe that” –
even if the interesting part is merely the internal logic of the belief,
rather than anything supernatural. The open mind is at home in the world of
untamed knowledge; the things we half know but haven’t fully grasped yet. Its
point of focus isn’t set on what’s happened in the past but what could happen
in the future. And finally the open mind doesn’t pastiche the opinions it
doesn’t believe in; _instead it argues earnestly on their behalf_ , so it can
fully understand both its own position, and the counter point.

For all these reasons, the strategic mind is an open one – with all the
weirdness, speculativeness, and inevitable wrongness which that entails.

So personally I would encourage you to engage seriously with non-serious
ideas. It isn’t credulous, or uncritical, quite the opposite. It is instead a
fluid method of analytical thinking, one which can digest a far more varied
diet of information than that which is tolerant only of facts.

And what is more, it’s fun too.
