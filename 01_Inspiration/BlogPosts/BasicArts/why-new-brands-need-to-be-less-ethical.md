Admirable though this interpretation is, for the purposes of this piece I’m
interested in employing the phrase in a different context. Rather than “good”
meaning high quality, here let’s interpret it as “virtuous”, or “moral”.

In this case then, it is perfect morality that stands in the way of good
morality.

This is particularly relevant in today’s market, as an increasing number of
businesses – indeed arguably the majority, at least of new ones – are equally
preoccupied with being noble as well as being effective. Normally this
nobility is measured either in terms of the health credentials of the product,
or its environmental friendliness – the new arms races, particularly for food,
drink, and fashion.

How is it then that high ideals in these spaces actually damage these causes,
rather than moving them forwards? Why does being too environmentally friendly
as a business actually damage the environment? Why does being too healthy make
people unhealthier?

Well, it’s like the excuse that such ethical businesses give when they’re
inevitably bought by a big corporate: to make real change you have to change
the mainstream.

Now, sure, this is a pretty convenient argument to make if you’re a founder
with $100million in your pocket and an army of angry consumers berating you
for “selling out”, but it’s not without merit. As the Seth Goldman, the
founder of Honest T explained upon selling his business to Coca-Cola, it’s
easier to change Coke from the inside than by standing outside their HQ
yelling and brandishing placards. Making a small change to a million consumers
is more impactful than making a big change to 100.

When it comes to promoting ethical change with your product, the same
principle applies. What will sell in large volumes is almost invariably less
“pure” a product than what you could conceivably make. Just pay a visit to
Planet Organic. Their shelves are stuffed with healthier products, using less
plastic, than anything you’ll find in Tesco. But you know what? Nobody buys
them. Relatively speaking anyway.

If you make your product too perfect, too “good”, you will make something
that, for whatever reason (usually price), is going to be unable to make an
impact on the market as a whole. Sure, you’ll be able to sleep at night. But
you won’t have made any difference. The people making the difference are not
those making products miles better than the mainstream, but a little bit
better. Just better enough so as that consumers can make the switch without
pain or sacrifice – ideally without even realising they’ve done it at all.

Those are the products that drive change.

The secret for brands who want to make an ethical change to their markets is
to employ a “once click” policy. How can we always stay just “one click” more
ethical than the mainstream? If you can stay multiple clicks ahead without
sacrificing accessibility, functionality, or usability, then great, but that’s
not often going to be possible. Instead the priority should be moving the
centre-ground of your market just a little bit, so that in the future it can
be moved some more.

One brand that has been extremely successful in this regard is Ecover. The
“ethical” cleaning products brand has come under constant attack from
campaigners due to the fact that, in reality, its products are far from
harmless. This is a fact openly admitted by its CEO Mick Bremans, who told The
Independent: “Our products harm the environment. They are not environmentally
friendly. We never say they are environmentally friendly.”

The truth is his products are something better than being truly
environmentally friendly: they’re relatively environmentally friendly, they’re
affordable, and they work. That means they sell, they grow, and they get the
Persils and Fairys of this world to panic about some of their most acute
ethical issues.

Many are the brands whose high ideals have held themselves back from this kind
of impact, with the net result of doing nothing but propping up the status
quo, and defining ethical as a “luxury” attribute.

So if you really want to make change happen, take a moment to ask if there’s a
way you can make what you do strategically less ethical. The planet – by and
by – may thank you for it.
