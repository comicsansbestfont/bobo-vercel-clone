Many projects I work on begin with this rough scenario:

_Company launches product – sales grow – sales start to plateau – company
doesn’t know what to do next_

The most obvious solution in this situation is to find some sort of “hack”
(generally via marketing) to restart growth, but often this isn’t a realistic
option. I strongly believe that most products have a “natural” size that they
will grow to without effort, and then simply stop, and cruise at that scale
indefinitely. Just like how a mouse is the size of a mouse for a reason, so
too can we say the same for a product. It fills a market gap, and once filled
there’s nowhere left for it to go. Sure, contextual conditions might change,
expanding the gap and thus growing the product – but you don’t control that.
Chances are that once growth begins to slow, you’re done.

Now clearly this is a big problem for a lot of brands because they make the
mistake of conflating their _company_ and their _product_. When asked what
they do, they will say that they “make X”, thus completely tying their fate
and business strategy to the performance of X. If X plateaus, then so does the
business, leaving them spinning their wheels.

Clearly, this isn’t ideal, so let’s get this straight right here: **your
product is not your company.**

The correct way to understand the relationship between these two things is
like this:

  * **The company** is an organisation that specialises in providing a certain value to the market.
  * **The product** is a _tool_ they use to deliver that value.

Understood this way, we can see that far from being the centre of the
business, products are actually somewhat _incidental_. You might be able to
deliver your value to the market in dozens of ways, represented by dozens of
products, and in principle, these can come and go without actually changing
the core nature of the business or business strategy.

Airbnb is a tidy example of this, hence why I’ve referenced them here a few
times. Their main _product_ is of course renting out people’s rooms and
apartments. However, the actual _market role_ of the business at large is
“helping people feel like locals when abroad”. As you can see, their core
product is a manifestation of this, but so are their secondary products –
which include alternative tour experiences run by locals, dining in people’s
houses as well as staying in them, and various other ideas they’ve toyed with
over the years.

It’s incredibly unlikely, but theoretically, in 10 years’ time Airbnb’s core
product may have completely disappeared but with the business still ticking
along quite happily – still “doing the same thing”, just doing it through a
different selection of products.

#### **The bottom line then: the value stays the same, the manifestations
change.**

What this means for brands who have plateaued is that, although there might be
a way to restart growth on their core product, their priority should be
_understanding the true market value their product delivers and then finding
other ways to deliver it_. This high-level business strategy, if correct,
should instantly yield:

  * New product ideas which are aligned with the existing one
  * New applications of the existing product
  * New category plays

A lot of my projects boil down to this challenge.

I’ll give you one example in MOJU, which I was delighted to learn now have not
one but TWO products in the UK’s top 5 grab-and-go juices and smoothies.

MOJU’s product innovation – as you may be aware – was “juice shots”: highly
concentrated doses of certain functional plants in a shot format. This was a
great idea, and thus achieved rapid organic growth, but it didn’t answer the
fundamental question: what does MOJU actually do?

Clearly, the answer is not “make juice shots”, because:

  * 1) this leaves them with nowhere to go beyond that, and moreover
  * 2) doesn’t actually speak to the _value_ the shots deliver.

Our main insight on the project was realising something obvious but easy to
miss: juice shots aren’t actually juices. (Yes, I know the data reported above
frames them that way, but that’s just supermarket category bumf, not a
representation of the real world, as explained
[here](https://basicarts.org/know-your-enemy/)). What I mean by this is that
although juice shots are “made of juice” people do not buy them as substitutes
for regular “drinking juice”. Instead, they actually buy them as substitutes
for pseudo-medicinal products like Berocca, Lemsip, energy drinks, and the
like: a loose category we labelled “performance products”. Now the thing about
that category is that it is extremely chemical, and unnatural – which made
MOJU an outlier proposition: the only all-natural performance products brand.

This then became the overarching [value
proposition](https://basicarts.org/what-does-a-strong-value-offering-look-
like/) of MOJU _the company_ , “natural performance”. This simultaneously
reframed the existing products, thus helping them to continue their growth, as
well as providing a blueprint for how MOJU can expand in the future, attacking
all those non-juice sub-categories which comprise the “performance products”
space.

In a sane world what I’ve just described above would be described as a
company’s “purpose” – but as it is that’s come to mean something different,
and thus most businesses are left with very little idea of what they do at a
company level.

So, if you want to open a path to continuous [business
growth](https://basicarts.org/), don’t be one of them. Know how to say what
you do without leaning entirely on the product you do it with. You are not
your product; you’re something much bigger.
