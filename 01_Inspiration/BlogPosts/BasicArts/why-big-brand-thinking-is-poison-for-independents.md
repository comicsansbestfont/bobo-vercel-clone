In spite of everything you read – including here – there isn’t really one
right way to run a business. Businesses can become successful via all sorts of
weird strategies, including ones that are diametrically opposed to one
another.

The single greatest fissure of this type is that between independent
companies, and group companies. By “independent” here, we mean businesses that
are founder-owned or run, and thus have a single, highly invested, leader at
the helm, and presumably limited budgets. And by “group” we mean those that
are subsidiaries of a major conglomerate, such as Unilever or General
Electric.

Now, we could be forgiven for assuming that the go-to-market techniques
employed by the corporate giants must be pretty effective. After all, they
have the deepest pockets, and thus access to the most brilliant minds, along
with decades of research that has enabled them to fine-tune a low-risk
approach. The problem, however, is that their deep pockets don’t only buy them
talent; they also place them in a completely different starting position to
that of most independent brands. They have bundles of cash, whilst most
growing companies don’t. They can also borrow the influence and clout of their
parent brand, opening doors to distributors and retailers that are closed to
genuine newcomers to the market. In short, they are brands born with silver
spoons in their mouths, and their strategies are naturally developed
accordingly.

Bearing this in mind, it should be self-evident folly for an independent brand
to copy a Mars or Coca-Cola approach to growth, since they are starting with
such different resources.

Sure enough, the best independent brands do indeed chart a different course –
a course so different from the “big brand approach” that it often easy to tell
what kind of business you’re looking just by cursory observation.

The crux of the difference is this: big brands grow by _taking_ , small brands
grow by _giving_.

Now this sounds highly critical of the big brands, but it isn’t really. They
are simply operating in an intelligent manner given the resources at their
disposal. Their technique is to constantly watch the market, observing
upcoming trends and shifts in consumer behaviour, and when they see a wave
rising (let’s say for sake of argument, coconut water), they jump on the
bandwagon and try to milk it for all it’s worth (OK, you can’t milk a
bandwagon, but you get the idea). They _extract value_ from the market by
copying something that’s working, and use brute force to overthrow the
pioneers in that space.

Those pioneers of course, are likely to be independent brands who have
achieved success via a giving approach. What this means is having an idea that
adds _new value_ to the market (rather than replicating an existing one),
which if you’re lucky gains some traction and takes off. Coconut water would
have, at one time, been such an idea.

To distil it down to its crudest form then, group brands thrive copying what
works, and using their power to gobble up as much of the market as possible,
whilst independent brands thrive by doing something original, with minimal
competition.

You can see how adopting the opposite approach would be folly for both
parties. Why on earth would a business like Procter & Gamble ever actually
gamble on a new idea, when the likelihood of success is so low? They know that
getting in reasonably early on an idea that someone else has already tested
has a far better hit rate, so to do anything else would be irrational. By the
same token, an independent brand using a replication strategy would also fail,
since they wouldn’t have the resources to overthrow the pioneers. They’d
simply be too late.

These dynamics tend to lead to noticeable differences between the very best
group and independent brands. Group brands thrive on broad appeal, and not
excluding anyone needlessly. Independent brands thrive on highly specific
appeal, and willingly turning some people off. Group brands tend to favour
building difference through stylistic factors and borrowing external
credibility (such as celebrity endorsement). Independent brands tend to build
favour by talking about themselves and the way they do things. Group brands
tend to be faceless. Independent brands tend to talk about their people. Group
brands tend to be opaque. Independent brands tend to be transparent. Group
brands tend to be normal. Independent brands tend to be weird.

All of these are good moves by both parties, _because all match with their
respective taking or giving strategies_. What would not be good however, would
be for an independent brand to borrow from the other side of the aisle – and
this is why looking up to “big brand success stories” is so dangerous for
entrepreneurs. David cannot beat Goliath at Goliath’s game, so he shouldn’t
waste his time trying*.

It’s hardly surprising that so many great businesses have been founded by
people who had no direct experience of their product category. The world of
soft-drink startups isn’t dominated by former Coke execs, despite that being
what some investors might favour. It’s instead dominated by founders who
haven’t been taught those incompatible habits. So if you find yourself in such
a situation, and are torn between your intuition and the supposed “best
practice” of the titans in your industry, go with your gut. Because although
you may not be right, the alternative is probably – in your case – wrong.

_*The same doesn’t quite apply the other way round unfortunately – Goliath can
beat David at David’s game. However it’s more difficult that way, so the good
news is he probably won’t bother._
