If any of you have read my free little ebook Make Companies Without
Competitors, or seen my “Love your competitors” talk, you’ll know that central
to my philosophy is the idea of non-competition.

Contrary to the common metaphor of the market being “battle ground” or
“playing field”, where there is implicitly an enemy to be defeated, I prefer
to think of it as an ecosystem, where every company represents an organism
that exists in symbiotic balance with the others around it.

Of course in practice it rarely works out like this, since we are irresistibly
drawn to zero-sum competition even when it isn’t in our best interests.
However in principle the theory is sound. In principle each business should
perform a unique role which complements the roles of its competitors – without
going directly against them for the same trade.

Acting this way ironically creates businesses that tend to dominate their
competition, even though that was never the intention – hence why it’s one of
the main things I preach.

Considering this then, you’d think that the word “winning” wouldn’t really be
in my business vocabulary. And formerly you would be right. Formerly I
preferred the word “success”, or even “health” to “winning”, because it more
accurately reflects a positive outcome in an ecosystem dynamic.

However I got to thinking and I realised that although this may be technically
true, in practice most businesses should actually think about “winning” more
than they do, not less.

How come?

Well, the problem with the word “success” is that it can be quite mediocre.
Success for most businesses could be defined as simply being semi-stable and
semi-profitable – which is nothing to sniff at, sure, but it falls far short
of anything we would recognise as greatness.

If you’re a local bakery or locksmith or some such this may be as far as you
aspire to go, which is great, I admire that. But for more “mass” businesses
that’s not the intention.

Nevertheless, muddling along like this tends to be where most end up.

The lure of “mediocre success” is, i would suggest, one of the main reasons
most businesses suck at strategy. They manage to limp to that status
unstrategically, and then spend the rest of their days trying to eke out extra
little bits of growth with random tactical fiddling.

In other words, because they’re doing “OK” by their own standards, they lack
the impetus to develop a strategy, and so never get round to it.

And that’s where “winning” becomes useful.

You see winning, as a concept, has no such mediocrity problem. If you ask a
founder what “winning” would look like for their business, they are likely to
give you a much more juicy and ambitious answer than they would when asked
about “success”. Winning implies a certain gloriousness and finality;
something which would require genius and risk to achieve.

Winning means altering the shape of a category.  
Winning means changing the way consumers think.  
Winning means making old ways of doing things obsolete.  
Winning means doing something they’ll teach in business schools.  
Winning means making a dent in the world.

In other words, winning demands strategy.

It’s not a coincidence that one of the most successful strategy books of all
time is called Playing to Win. In it A. G. Lafley, the former CEO of Procter &
Gamble details the stories behind various billion dollar successes the company
achieved in the past few decades. It’s a pretty dry read, and frankly I
wouldn’t recommend it, but even so there’s no denying the guy has a great
strategic track record – and his commitment to winning has a lot to do with
it. The brands he talks about were already turning over hundreds of millions
of dollars in their “losing” unstrategic states. It was only the ambitious
vision of “winning” that prompted them to take strategy seriously, and push
them into the billions.

Other companies, satisfied merely with “success”, would probably have never
bothered.

Now of course, I’m not saying that creating a $200million brand wouldn’t be a
win for you and I. It’s all relative of course. A company with the resources
of P&G can pretty much chuck out any stupid idea and push it to that scale.
What matters here is recognising what winning looks like for you, not anyone
else.

And the answer must be something of a stretch.

So to kick start your strategic journey, I’d Invite you to begin by defining
what winning would look like for you.

Despite the origins of the word, it doesn’t have to be competitive in nature.
It simply has to be an outcome that would represent an unambiguous “smash” for
you. And typically, that will be something beyond the humdrum success you are
achieving today.

Then, and perhaps only then, you’ll begin to feel the need for strategy.
