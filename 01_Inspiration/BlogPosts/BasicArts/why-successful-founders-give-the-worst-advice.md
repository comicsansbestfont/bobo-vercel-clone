I’ve written before about the inherent limits of expertise, and how it is at
that boundary that strategy takes over.

What I’ve not written about however is the  _limits of strategy_.

The reason for that is pretty obvious of course, it’s hardly in my best
interests. I’m here to sell you on strategic thinking, and the advantages that
accrue when you do it well – however it would be dishonest of me to claim that
it’s crucial factor in determining success (_particularly_ business success).

No, the truth is that strategy pales in comparison to one far bigger, and far
more unfortunate factor: “the lottery”.

I take the term “lottery” from a tweet I once read but unfortunately can’t
locate, and thus can’t credit. However it went something like this:

**“Most advice you hear from successful entrepreneurs boils down to them
sharing their winning lottery numbers”.**

In other words: the key factor behind many success stories is not strategic,
it’s just dumb luck. By this I don’t mean anything pejorative necessarily; I
simply mean that the factor is  _uncontrollable_. It’s not something which
could be repeated with any reliability, and thus amounts to totally useless
advice. We’re talking about things like: random family connections, being in
the right meeting, having an unrealistic amount of cash to play with, randomly
stumbling across a big break etc. – the kind of things which, frankly, make
the world go round.

_(Fairly often when I’m curious about a brand’s success, I do a bit of
research into their background seeking to extract some helpful insights, only
to find myself presented with a factor such as this. You’d be shocked by how
many brands have a celebrity behind them, let me tell you.)_

What is particularly cutting about the tweet however is not the observation
that so much success is down to luck – it’s rather the implication that many
entrepreneurs don’t even  _realise_ that this is the case.

They think that what was true for them will be true for others, when in
reality their path will often have been so unique and extraordinary that
there’s little for the outside observer to learn at all.

I saw an amusing example of this the other day when an influential
entrepreneur, Noah Kagan, shared a “cold email” he received, to show his
followers of what a great cold email looks like. A couple of points from it
were:

“Hey Noah, I’ve never told you this but you inspired me back in Berkeley. I
was a freshman at the very first CBSA meeting and your pitch seemed to make
sense […] 8 years ago I started my own company and we have bootstrapped to
$150m in total revenue […] I happen to be in Austin on Monday and would love
to meet you for tacos.”

No doubt it was a great email, guaranteed to get a response. What was striking
however was the suggestion that this was in any way “cold”, or that anyone
could learn from it.

Even if we leave aside the minor issue of having built a $150m business (which
probably would have been enough to get a meeting with most people all by
itself), we have the intimacy of both having been in  _a single pivotal
meeting in an elite University 10 years prior_. To judge from the comments
below, far from being inspiring, the way it was intended, many readers found
the tweet to be depressing and demotivating, as if it were advertising what a
closed shop the elite tech world really is, and just how circumstantial
success can be.

**This then is precisely why, counter-intuitively, extremely successful
entrepreneurs do not give the best advice.**

They will  _always_ have relied on a mixture of skill and fortune – a mixture
of the replicable and unreplicable – on their road to the top. Nothing wrong
what that at all, it’s just how things work in the real world. This makes it
hard for them to get a clean read on which parts of their experience are truly
useful to outside observers, and which parts are unique to their own personal
journey.

It’s ironic really, because you’ll often hear people say something like “why
should we listen to a university business professor who’s never achieved
anything in the real world?”. Or indeed they might justifiably throw the same
criticism at me: after all, I’ve never created a billion dollar company, so
who am I to tell you what to do?

However I think it is our lack of “real world success” that, perversely, makes
our advice valuable. It is not “tainted” by the unique combination of random
messy factors which lie behind actual achievement. Our job is instead to
extract the  _replicable_ ingredients for success without letting the
_unreplicable_ lottery-like ingredients distract. I’m sure others would
disagree, but if you had the chance of getting advice on your business from
either a random business professor, or a billionaire unicorn founder, you
should probably take the professor. (Unless you’re looking for contacts that
is… then it’s a totally different story!)

In conclusion then, this is ultimately why we must place most of our attention
on strategy.

It may not be the number one factor driving success – but it is the number one
_controllable_ factor. It is something which is at least  _somewhat_
predictable,  _somewhat_ manageable,  _somewhat_ learnable.

The other stuff; the lottery stuff; the stuff which will act as  _the_ true
catalyst for your billions and your cover profile on Forbes or whatever… well,
that’s a mystery. All you can be is prepared for when it comes – and humble in
its presence.
