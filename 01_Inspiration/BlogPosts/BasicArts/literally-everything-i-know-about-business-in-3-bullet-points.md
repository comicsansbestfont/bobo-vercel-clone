OK, I have a confession to make:

I don’t really know what the word “marketing” means.

I don’t know what the word “proposition” means. I don’t know what the word
“positioning” means. I don’t really know precisely what _any_ technical
business word means, even “strategy” (or at least what other people mean when
they say the term).

Now obviously I get the _gist_ of all this stuff, but I wouldn’t like to be
pinned down on it. I’ve not swallowed the textbooks or done the tests. My
understanding of these “official” terms really stems from listening to the way
people talk about them, and inferring some vague meaning from the context.

Considering this confession, you might well ask why the hell you should listen
to me? After all, the stuff of business is _built_ from ideas like these. You
understand them, you knit them together, and hey presto, there’s your
business!

**How could you possibly do it any other way?**

Well, I’m here to tell you that there _is_ another way – a way that I think is
far more simple, intuitive, and direct, and which enables you to master
business without “properly” understanding any of those things.

It’s the way I taught myself, the way that informs all my content, and the way
that I apply to all my clients. Maybe it’s bollocks, but heck, it’s got me
this far, so it must be good for something. _Especially_ if it can be boiled
down to three simple bullet points.

Long time readers will have heard me lay this out before, but I’m going to
repeat it again here simply in order to illustrate how _all other bits of
business are downstream from these ideas_. And how if you truly internalise
them, you don’t really need anything else.

Here we go.

  1. All business is nothing more than an attempt to create something people want, and are prepared to exchange money for.
  2. Your ability to receive money for that thing is directly correlated with how hard it is for people to get it from somewhere else.
  3. The more you increase these two metrics (desire for the thing + scarcity), the more money you will make.

That’s it. Honestly I really cannot see how there is anything more to say or
know than that.

Of course lots of the “sub disciplines” like marketing or whatever contain
techniques and tools which will assist in that endeavour. However I would
suggest that many experts in those sub disciplines lose sight of this
fundamental equation above, rendering their expertise kinda meaningless.

If you manage to create a business that nails the demands of those three
points, but has done _nothing else_ in terms of technical rigour, then it
really won’t matter, because the thing’s probably gonna be flying regardless.

As for strategy, well, in my opinion it is simply the exercise of nailing this
equation, and driving up the desire + scarcity. Because it’s quite a broad a
flabby term (literally anything that will get you from point A to point B can
be called a “strategy”), I think this is accurate enough – and any tighter
definition is more of a refinement of this idea than it is a contradiction of
it.

Another thing that’s really cool here is that when you base your thinking on
first principles like this, you can actually create your own methodologies for
getting the job done.

No longer are you limited to the textbook!

Anything you can think of that will deliver this end goal is fair game, and
that has the potential to yield some pretty original thinking, and new ways to
get an advantage.

I don’t think of myself as a particularly original thinker, in that most of my
ideas have probably been said before in different ways, but sometimes the
ideas _feel_ original, which is the next best thing – and this all comes from
reverting back to first principles, rather than reverting back to “technique”.

So there you go. You can unsubscribe now. Burn the book. Unfollow the
accounts. Because really I have nothing more to say to you – just endless
remixes and diversions on the same simple theme, which hopefully, bit by bit,
embed it into your brain.
