One of my favourite things is to come up with new ways of explaining old
concepts.

They say there’s nothing new under the sun, and I think that’s true – but
there _are_ new ways of _expressing_ things, and they can be just as valuable.
After all, every new expression of an old idea makes it new to a fresh group
of people who didn’t quite “get” the old way of saying it.

And, needless to say, in strategy this technique is essential.

Everybody’s heard the old ways of talking about it, and most of them still
don’t get it. So the only way around it is to keep saying the same old stuff
in new ways, with new angles, and new thought experiments.

And today, I want to show you a good one.

I’m gonna name it “The Cringe Test”, and it’s a test which you can apply to
your own business, to measure its strategic strength.

Ready? Here it is:

**Tell me what your business does, without mentioning your product, or
sounding like a prat.**

Can you do it?

This is a powerful test because it reveals the presence (or absence) of
strategy in two key ways.

## I. Product detachment

The first part of the test – saying what your business does without mentioning
the product or service – establishes whether your business is focused on
delivering _value_ (which is “above” product), or just product (which could
potentially deliver many different forms of value).

As regular readers will know, the essence of strategy is to find a way to
offer extraordinary value to the market – and a product or service is merely a
_tool_ with which to deliver that value.

No clear idea of value? Then no strategy. And not being able to describe your
business without resorting to a description of the product is a clear “tell”
that this is the case.

So to use myself as an example, my product is obviously “strategy consultancy
services”. However if I was to describe my business without resorting to that
I could say something like “I help brands make bold moves to escape the
competition”. The fact is that I do this in various ways other than
consultancy – for example this newsletter – thus enabling brand stretch and
consistency.

## II. The cringe factor

That first part is pretty standard fare, but this second part is what makes
the test effective.

Most CEOs could make a pretty good stab at describing their business without
mentioning their product, IF they resorted to cringey platitudes.

Stuff like:

“We delight our customers”  
“We nurture the human spirit”  
“We make life easier for people”  
“We brighten the everyday”

Now that’s all well and good, but imagine being in a pub and answering with
one of those when someone asks what you do. You just _wouldn’t_. Or if you
did, you’d sound like a prize idiot. It would be humiliating. The cringe
factor is just far too great.

Answers like these are both grandiose and vague, because they replace
strategic content with superlatives. Therefore by measuring for cringe you can
do a pretty good job of instantly establishing whether there’s any strategic
content there.

A business with a good strategy will be able to do this without sounding
ridiculous.

So how did you do?

If you want to take it a step further you can ask your team to take the test
too – you’ll probably get a colourful mix of answers, and who knows, some of
them may be pretty good. At the very least they’ll be revealing.

But speaking broadly it’s always interesting to use these more visceral, less
intellectual tests to measure the value of something.

If you find something embarrassing, awkward, or repulsive, there’s probably a
pretty good reason for that.

And in the field of strategy (or worse, brand), such reactions are sadly
pretty common!
