I’ve often felt that you can boil strategy down to an attempt to simply be as
_honest_ as possible.

About your business.  
About yourself.  
About the world.

The closer you get to absolute truth, the more effective your actions. With
God-like omniscience anything can be done. You of course know a lot less – but
the closer you can get to that ideal the more powerful you’ll be.

Needless to say the flip side of this is also true:

**Bad strategies are built on lies.**

And they are the worst kind of lies, because they are the _ones you tell
yourself_ – which means you can’t easily spot them. They are the things you
insert in some subconscious attempt to flatter or protect yourself, or to play
politics, or to look clever, or to align with some prejudice or other.

Whatever the reason, the point is you have some ingredient that _isn’t true_.
And so the strategy is doomed from the start.

Now the easy way to reveal these lies is to get an honest, straight talking,
external set of eyes on things- because frankly they’ll often be pretty
obvious to people with no skin in the game. But in the absence of that you can
sometimes weed them out yourself.

How?

Well you can start with these three questions…

## I. Are you insulting the competition?

One of the most common lies basically boils down to “our competition is shit,
so we will win by not being shit”. Of course it’s never framed that way, but
that’s the thrust.

This fails on two levels: first, because the competition is almost never
_actually_ shit, at least not in the view of the market who are presumably
paying them. And second, because this belief drives you into an ineffective
“better” strategy that does nothing to open up new market space.

The way to weed this out is simple. Just examine your strategy to see if you
are building it on _anything_ that is insulting to the competition. On
anything that implies the competition are unskilled, or lazy, or greedy, or
malevolent, or stupid. They might be all those things, but that’s by the by,
because you need to be offering a _good faith_ alternative – one which assumes
that they do one totally legitimate thing, and you do another.

_(All that being said, there are exceptions. Octopus Energy in the UK have
done fantastically well due to their competition genuinely being awful – but
it’s extremely rare you’ll get such an open goal like that!)_

## II. Does your strategy cost you something?

Real decisions come at a price. They demand you give up something. They must
hurt, at least a little. So the question here is: does yours?

What are you giving up? What are you sacrificing? What money are you leaving
on the table? What makes this move in some way bold or brave or risky?

If the answer is “nothing really”, then there is probably some kind of fantasy
assumption at play here. One where you’re telling yourself – falsely – that
you can eat your cake and have it too. Another very likely possibility is that
your strategy has no cost because it doesn’t really even _do_ anything in the
first place. The lie here isn’t so much in the _substance_ of the strategy as
it is in the labelling of it as a “strategy” in the first place!

You know what they say, “the truth hurts”, so frankly you should expect a
decent strategy to do the same.

## III. Are you validating prior decisions?

You could say, at a pinch, that a great strategy makes your old decisions look
foolish. After all, something must have been going wrong, or else why are you
bothering? By the same token then, a bad strategy makes your old decision look
_wise_.

A bad strategy says “look, here’s why we were right about all this stuff!”.

Now I’m not saying that a strategy needs to tear everything down. Far from it.
A big part of the strategic game is identifying the stuff that’s working, and
doing it more. But it does need to tear _something_ down. It does need to
invalidate _some_ prior point of view.

You could do worse than creating a section on your strategy doc titled
something like:

“What we thought was right but isn’t”.

That shows a change in direction. That shows growth! And isn’t that basically
what we’re after here? Growth?

___

When it comes to this stuff, I’m as guilty as the next guy. A lot of the
principles I share are basically guardrails against these natural slippery
tendencies we all have in common.

But like with anything, admitting you have a problem is half the battle. Do
that, and scan for your deceptions, and your powers won’t exactly become
“Godlike”… but they’ll certainly be a lot better.
