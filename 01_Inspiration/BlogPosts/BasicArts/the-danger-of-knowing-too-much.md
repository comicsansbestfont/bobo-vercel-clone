Consider the following paradox:

**The more news you consume, the more ignorant you may become.**

How can this be true? After all, clearly the person who reads the paper
regularly, watches a 24 hour news channel, devours current affairs podcasts,
and spends hours on Twitter will end up _knowing_ an awful lot of stuff.
Certainly far more than the person who does none of those things. Given that
we equate knowledge to wisdom and understanding, it should then stand to
reason that the news hound will develop a very good idea of the way the world
works. And yet this isn’t always the case.

The issue is nothing to do with fake news (although that certainly doesn’t
help) – it’s simply one of _proportionality_. The news media naturally favours
stories that are extreme, negative, and which fit into certain meta narratives
that drive sales. This means of course that reading the news will give you a
distorted picture of the way the world really is: overemphasising some things
and underemphasising others, ultimately leaving the reader crippled in their
ability to see the big picture.

I’m sure we all know someone like this – or perhaps are even like this
ourselves. I for one know that there are certain media talking points which
get me riled up,_even though I’ve literally never encountered these issues in
real life_. This isn’t “being informed”. It’s “being corrupted”. Two things
which are far more similar than they initially appear.

In comparison the person who consumes little of this may not “know” a lot in
terms of facts and events, but what they do know will be via direct experience
and as such will be proportionate and realistic. They are closer to seeing the
world as it is, rather than an image of it that is warped through arbitrary
information.

I use this idea to furnish the basic message of this piece, which is simply:

**Too much detailed knowledge can lead to poor decision-making.**

On paper this shouldn’t be the case. On paper all accurate information should
be useful in understanding an issue, or developing a strategy. The problem
however is that since we are incapable of gathering _complete_ and
_proportionate_ information on any issue, we have a tendency to get overly
swayed by the limited information we can collect. The more trees we pay
attention to, the less we are able to see the wood, leading to a narrowing of
our perspective the more we learn.

This diagram illustrates the point. You start with low knowledge but holistic
thinking, but as you gather knowledge your thinking narrows.

A real-world example of this idea that I’ve mentioned before can be found in
the debate concerning the health effects of sunshine. We used to intuitively
understand that sunlight was good for us. It raises our mood. It gives us a
healthy-looking glow. Plants grow towards it. It warms us. Etc. However when
science learned of the link between sunshine and skin cancer, the message
reversed. We entered a period where we were actively encouraged to avoid the
sun, and to wear sunscreen every day as a matter of routine. Now that the
science is becoming more subtle, we are beginning to see that this was an
error, and that although the link between the sun and skin cancer is of course
true in a narrow sense, that doesn’t mean the sun isn’t good for us on the
whole.

This was a classic case of detail-oriented thinking clouding our sense of the
big picture. This happens all the time in businesses – so much so that I’ve
found I’m often able to make meaningful breakthroughs _in my very first
meetings with prospective clients_. It’s not that I come up with anything
particularly groundbreaking or insightful. It’s just that I know nothing,
which forces me to take a big picture perspective that the far more
knowledgable client is no longer able to take.

This distortive power of detail contributes to a further paradox which I
absolutely adore:

**Idiots and geniuses tend to come to the same conclusions, whilst merely
intelligent people come to different (and wrong) ones.**

As you can probably gather, what idiots and geniuses have in common is the
ability to see things holistically and intuitively. Perhaps in the idiot’s
case this is because they have no other information, don’t overthink things,
and thus have no choice – whist the genius is knowledgable but knows how to
handle that knowledge – but either way the end result is the same. The merely
intelligent person on the other hand, with their bias towards hard facts and
analysis tends to cling to what little knowledge they have, and thus arrives
at a flawed conclusion.

I know it’s a bit cringe to quote Albert Einstein, but nevertheless he nailed
it when he said: “The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is
a faithful servant. We have created a society that honours the servant and has
forgotten the gift.”

Fetishising detail and facts is the mechanism by which we forget the gift,
whilst fooling ourselves into believing we’re doing the “smart” thing.

In sum then, whilst I would never discourage the gathering of quality data
when tackling a problem, I would encourage you to hold that data lightly.
Embrace not only the facts, but more importantly the gist. Get comfortable
with generalisations. Become a master of the sweeping statement. Because these
pejorative terms aren’t your enemy, they are your friends. They are tools for
proportionality, and the fruits of intuition.
