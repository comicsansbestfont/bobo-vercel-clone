When all is said and done, there are only two methods of attracting customers.

**One of these is obvious, and everyone knows it.**  
**The other is secret, and almost nobody knows it.**

The obvious one represents the assumption that guides the vast majority of
brands – probably including yours. It’s the water they swim in, so they don’t
even know realise its an assumption in the first place. They just think it’s
“how business works”, and never stop to question if there might be another
way.

The secret one, however, represents the assumption that guides almost all of
the iconic brands you care to think of.  _It’s a totally different game_ , a
reversal of the norm. It’s not that these brands are “doing things better”
than everyone else. No, it’s more that they’re doing something different.
They’re playing poker while everyone else is playing blackjack.

I’ll quickly spell out the obvious method and then we’ll move on to the secret
one.

In essence the way people believe the purchase process works is like this:

**Need — > Choice**

First the punter “needs” something, and decides to go shopping for it. Then
they survey their options and make their choice. For example they might think
“I’d like to get a motorbike”, and then they decide which one they’re going to
get .

In this paradigm customer needs emerge organically, and then brands compete to
win that sale. High performing brands are those who either win a
disproportionate amount of the sales, or those who manage to command a higher
profit per sale.

First comes the need, then the choice. Simple right?

Now this model is obviously true and pervasive. There’s nothing wrong with it,
and there are many billion dollar brands operating within its logic.

However there is another logic which is much more powerful, and yet almost
completely invisible to the average brand, and that is this:

**Choice — > Need**

This is when a consumer chooses something  _without a well-defined pre-
existing need_ , and then post-rationalises or creates the need afterwards.

If that sounds implausible, just think of this kind of thought process: “wow
Harleys are cool, I’d really like one of them – maybe I’ll get a bike”.

In this example the hypothetical consumer didn’t want a motorbike in the
abstract. They wanted a Harley, and this prompted them to enter the market. If
Harleys didn’t exist, they would never have bought a bike at all. And
furthermore, because they made their choice  _prior to the need_ , they never
considered any other brands either.

This “choice first, need later” thought process is far more prevalent than we
think. It’s evidenced by how often we make purchases where we don’t seriously
consider multiple options. For instance:

  * Most people who buy an iPhone don’t “consider” an HTC
  * Most people who buy a Patagonia jacket don’t “consider” a Berghaus
  * Most people who buy a Tesla don’t “consider” a Kia
  * Most people who buy a carton of Oatly don’t “consider” Alpro

All of these brands have perfectly adequate competitors which provide viable
alternatives to the consumer… but in many purchase cases the consumer totally
ignores them. This is because it is the  _specific brand_ that has attracted
them to make that purchase in the first place, not some abstract “need”.

Now of course we aren’t all going to build brands that are global icons like
this (although we should try). But even so, there is a profound lesson here
even for tiny brands.

What it suggests is that there are in fact not one, but  _two_ markets for any
product:

  * The “organic” market, which is needs driven
  * And then the wider “dormant” market, which is choice driven, and can be “activated” only when an exciting brand triggers it

You can imagine this using the motorbike example. The organic market is the
market of  _true_ bikers – people who are going to ride motorbikes by hook or
by crook, and will choose from the options within it. The dormant market is
the far larger market of people who will only enter the category if a specific
brand appeals to them in a “category transcending” way, like how Harley
Davidson does.

Now imagine this same dynamic for a much smaller business and category – let’s
say curry paste.

Again there is an organic market for curry paste. People who want to make a
curry, and will go to the shop and pick from the pastes available. Fine. But
then there is this much larger dormant market of people who are not going to
make a curry  _unless_ a particular charismatic brand cuts through and makes
them want it. Those people will not even consider the other curry pastes of
course – they’ll just go straight to the one that attracted them in the first
place.

**Such brands then, are those who don’t focus on answering a pre-existing
need, but who focus on _creating a need_ among the dormant market.**

The beauty of the approach is, of course, that they will also win a huge slug
of the organic market too – just as many bikers do choose Harleys and many
hikers do choose Patagonia and many electric car browsers do choose Teslas.

Although there are exceptions, and some brands are strategically better suited
to the normal paradigm, I would strongly encourage anyone to think first and
foremost about how they can appeal to people who aren’t naturally shopping for
what they’re selling.

Even if your idea doesn’t really work, it should at least make you more
distinctive and appealing to the organic market, which is a pretty decent
second prize.

Just think of how many potential customers might be lying dormant outside of
your organic market – totally untapped by all your “needs answering”
competitors.

Got get em.
