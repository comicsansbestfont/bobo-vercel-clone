equivalents and still get the gist._

___

When I was growing up, I vividly remember our family’s Saturday night viewing
routine: Blind Date, Gladiators, and Birds of a Feather. An unbeatable triple
combo of mainstream light entertainment, enjoyed not only by us but millions
of others across the country.

Those, of course, were different times. There were only 5 TV stations (4 in my
household, we couldn’t get the exotic Channel 5), and so naturally the
nation’s viewing habits were concentrated into the meagre options available.
This dynamic didn’t only apply to TV of course – everybody listened to Oasis
and the Spice Girls, everybody watched Titanic and Forrest Gump, everybody
drank Coca-Cola, everybody voted for Tony Blair – this was the age of mass-
market appeal before we were able to burrow down into our internet-enabled
niches.

Now, we are told, times have changed. We are free to indulge our unique
personal tastes, watch what we want, listen to what we want, eat how we want,
and so on. In the past, if you had a weird interest, like rating airline food
or cataloguing potatoes that look like celebrities, you’d struggle to gather
enough like minded souls to indulge it. But connectivity has fixed all that.
There’s now supposedly a market for everything, and this, in turn, has eaten
away at the middle and killed the mass market.

At least, that’s the narrative.

For founders, this narrative has been liberating. For the most part, they
understand that it’s important to be differentiated, and to have a unique
proposition – and the increased commercial viability of niche-ness has enabled
them to do that. To be unique _and_ mass – formerly to the only reliable path
to success – is extremely difficult. The low-hanging fruit has been taken, and
it often seems like there are no such ideas left to be had. But to be unique
and _niche_? Well, that’s easy. Keto dog food, cactus water, CBD dental floss
– the modern marketplace makes these once ludicrous ideas appear viable.

**But is all this true?**

Is the mass market really in retreat? And are niche propositions really
commercially viable? Although these trends are undeniably real, my sense is
that they are wildly overstated – and that the mass market represents a far
bigger opportunity than most founders realise.

In reality, the mass market is still alive and well – it’s just that certain
segments of the population (including most founders) have managed to
successfully tune out of it, and so don’t realise just how healthy and
powerful it still is.

A perfect example of this can be seen in the sitcom Mrs Brown’s Boys, which
was recently voted the greatest sitcom _ever_ in a BBC poll. The show – which
ended last year – was drawing 90s-esque viewing figures of 10 million people
per episode. And yet here’s the thing: have you ever watched it?

Understandably those overseas won’t have, but I’m guessing that even for my UK
audience the answer will also be no. I know I haven’t. In fact to tell the
truth I’m only vaguely aware of its existence. And this says nothing about the
show; it simply says that I, as a certain kind of media user, have
successfully isolated myself from the mainstream, which continues to exist
quite happily in my absence.

This self-isolation doesn’t only apply to my TV watching habits, it applies to
pretty much everything. For example, I am very interested in nutrition,
health, and new brands, and as such haven’t bought a mainstream packaged
product like Frosties, Sprite, Muller Light, or Carling for many years.

**But again, that doesn’t mean these products are in trouble – it just means
that weirdos like me now have the means to avoid them.**

The problem for founders is that that they are typically the same. They kid
themselves into believing the mainstream is contracting simply because they’ve
inoculated themselves from it. They listen to weird stuff on Spotify, they go
deep on Netflix and spend more time looking at the pages of Courier magazine
than the shelves of Tesco. This gives them a distorted picture of the world –
one where everyone is going vegan, is into micro-dosing, and knows what NFTs
are.

This problem is exacerbated by the thriving communities of founders that exist
today. It’s fantastic that we are able to connect with and support one
another, that’s for sure. But it has also created an echo chamber. One where
cool but fundamentally niche brands become the benchmark for new
[innovation](https://basicarts.org/how-to-make-an-innovative-product-idea-go-
mainstream/), whilst genuinely successful ones are ignored, o _r not known
about at all_.

The result of all this is a failure to spot where the real market
opportunities lie.

My [advice to brands](https://basicarts.org/why-brands-struggle-with-purpose/)
(_especially_ FMCG brands in the UK, which isn’t a big enough market to
properly sustain niche propositions, unlike the USA) is simple: understand the
mass market players you overlap with, and position against them. Find the Mrs
Brown’s Boys of your market, understand why it works, and respond to it.

Even if you never manage to topple them, that doesn’t matter. What matters is
that they have shaped the market that you operate in. They set the cultural
agenda. They define what brands like you normally offer, look like, and cost.
It is your responsibly to fit in with the expectations they have created, and
then to twist them. To refresh the market. To give people – real people –
something new.

Glancing at the top 100 selling grocery brands in the UK for 2020, I would
estimate that around 95 have been around for well over 20 years – most of them
much longer. The only slightly more recent ones which jumped out were Fever
Tree, Monster, and Nakd (Innocent is there too, but if we call them “new” we
are really scraping the barrel).

**At what is supposedly a glorious time for new brands, there is tragically
little churn at the top end of the market.**

So although there are lots of reasons for this, let’s not allow our own myopia
to be one of them. Let’s not let snobbishness, fear, or infatuation with the
niche to restrain our ambition.

There are unique _and_ mass propositions still there for the taking.

Watch ITV, walk around Tescos, listen to Heart, and you’ll find they’re hiding
in plain sight.
