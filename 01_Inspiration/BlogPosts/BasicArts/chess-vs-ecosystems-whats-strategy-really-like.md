The other day someone sent me a great [Twitter
thread](https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1597886668719198210) where a
strategy expert explained why he doesn’t do consultancy: namely because, in
his view, there is  _no such thing_ as strategy consultancy.

You should check out the thread as it’s pretty entertaining, but in essence
his argument was that strategy and execution aren’t divisible, so you cannot
have a different person “doing the strategy” to the one executing. In his view
this makes about as much sense as getting somebody to “play a game of chess on
your behalf” – admittedly a pretty ridiculous concept.

If you’re strategising you’re executing, and if you’re executing you’re
strategising, so where precisely does consultancy ever enter into it?

Hmm, interesting stuff.

Naturally as a “strategy consultant” I am duty bound to disagree, but I was
wondering  _why_ I disagree. I don’t simply think he’s wrong. Indeed, quite
the opposite. I think he’s right. In fact I think everyone is right almost all
the time. Disagreements don’t arise when one person is right and the other is
wrong – instead they arise when two people are looking at different parts of
reality, and explaining what they see. If you zoom out far enough, the
differences resolve, and you can see that there was in fact no disagreement at
all.

So I wanted to try the same thing here – to explain why the author of this
thread is right, and yet also why strategy consultancy is completely viable.
And to do this, we must tease apart two different “versions” of strategy which
are often confused, and can be explained by two different analogies:

I’ll start with “chess strategy” which, obviously, is the one referenced in
the thread.

Chess strategy understands strategic behaviour to be akin to playing a game of
chess; where you’re locked in a competitive battle with another party (i.e.
another brand), and each of you make “moves” to try and gain advantage each
other. The important thing to understand about chess strategy is that it
breaks strategy down into granular actions (moves) spread over time, just like
in a real game of chess. So your flow of action will look something like this:

**Move 1: do X**  
**Move 2: do Y**  
**Move 3: do Z**

In between each move the scenario (e.g. the market) changes, and so you have
to re-strategise so you can plan for your next action.

Understood this way strategy is rolling process of perpetual analysis and
adjustment based on unfolding circumstances. There isn’t really a single macro
strategy per se, because you are called upon to be responsive. Yes, just like
in a game of chess you might begin with a general strategic approach in mind,
or you might follow a strategy for series of moves – but eventually this will
be largely out of the window, since you’re “in play” now, and no plan survives
contact with the enemy.

As you can see, when understood this way it is true that “strategic
consultancy” isn’t entirely natural. Strategy requires a continual flow of
move-adapt-move-adapt-move-adapt, which, if someone was to do it for you,
would basically mean they’re doing your job.

_(Even so I would argue that it’s beneficial to get strategic advice during
this process so you have someone to bounce things around with and who can
offer a different perspective – but that’s by the by)_

Still, whether or not consultancy is right for chess strategy, it certainly is
for our other version of strategy, “ecosystem strategy”.

Ecosystem strategy understands businesses as parts of a “natural ecosystem”
(i.e. the market), within which they play a particular role, just as an
organism does. For instance in nature bees do one “job”, wolves do another,
and oak trees do another – and by the same token so do various businesses in a
given market. In both cases the health and success of the organism/business is
dictated by 1) understanding what its role is, and 2) doing that role
effectively, in a manner that’s harmonious with the competitors around it.

So for a basic example, Jeep know that their role in the ecosystem is to make
rugged off-road vehicles, and so provided they do that effectively they’ll
continue to thrive. It would be “off strategy” if they were suddenly to make a
natty little urban runaround.

Now where ecosystem strategy differs from chess strategy is that it is “one
big idea” that the business keeps on referring to over time, rather than a
sequence of smaller more changeable ideas. Whilst chess strategy assumes that
the two players (businesses) are fundamentally the same at the start of play,
ecosystem strategy assumes that they are distinct, and have totally different
ways of being in the world – totally different “rules” by which they play. An
ecosystem strategy determines who you are at an existential level – and as
such what moves you are suited to going forwards.

In this scenario then strategy consultancy is totally viable, because the
strategy (i.e. the role of the business in the ecosystem) is a general
blueprint which can then be handed-over to execute. The consultant says “the
overarching job of your business is X”, and then you are able to go and
execute using that understanding as a guide.

**Yes, once again we are confronted by the blurred definitions of the word
“strategy”; the industry’s eternal curse.**

It goes without saying that there is no either/or when it comes to chess and
ecosystem strategies. You should do both. Jeep know what their overarching
ecosystem strategy is, but they still play chess on a day-to-day basis. They
still have to make a sequence of moves, each time adjusting to changed
circumstances. It’s just that they make those moves  _as Jeep_ – not as some
abstracted generic “company”.

Strategy then is both “fixed”  _and_ “ever changing”. It is an interplay
between  _what you can do at this moment in time_ **and**  _who you are_.
Neglect either one of these and you’re only doing half a job – whether you’ve
got a consultant helping you, or not.
