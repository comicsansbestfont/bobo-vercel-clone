There is a quote you may have heard which goes something like:

“I am a libertarian at the federal level, Republican at the state level,
Democrat at the local level, a socialist with my friends and family, and a
communist with my dog”.

The idea is designed to reveal the fatuousness of political labels, but when
taken more broadly it beautifully illustrates the importance of an almost
completely neglected concept in modern life:

**Scale**.

To think about things (ideas, systems, organisations, strategies) in terms of
scale is to recognise that they behave differently when implemented at
different “sizes”, and across different expanses of space. In the case of the
above quote, you can see that it suggests that various policies work when
activated at the appropriate scale – and equally that they don’t work when
activated at a different, inappropriate scale.

This way of thinking differs wildly from the more standard belief that certain
ideas are simply “good” or “bad” in a general sense. Scale matters hugely, and
your behaviours and philosophies must vary a great deal when you are operating
at different levels.

If I were to offer a very rough rule of thumb for this variation, it would be
something like:

_The bigger the scale the less you should seek to control things; the smaller
the scale the more you may control things._

At the root of this idea is the unassailable (but routinely ignored) fact of
human limitation. We creatures, it goes without saying, are not omnipotent. We
are smart, but we are only _so_ smart. We can see, but we can only see _so_
far. We can run, but we can run only _so_ fast. We can remember, but we can
only remember _so_ much.

What this means is that we have a highly limited “sphere of competence”. In
other words, we have a scale at which we are highly competent (generally
referred to as “human scale”), and then larger scales at which we are
incompetent (what we might call “inhuman scale”).

**When we seek to master conditions at a human scale we are highly effective.
But when we seek to control things at an inhuman scale we are less so –
sometimes disastrously.**

An example I’ve used before of this idea is the comparison between a car
engine and the global economy. The car engine is a human scaled machine which
we can effectively manipulate and master – thus producing predictable results
in line with our intentions. The global economy on the other hand is an
“inhuman scaled machine”, which we cannot reliably manipulate and master –
thus producing unpredictable results not in line with our intentions.

Historically I believe this idea was well understood, but as technology has
gradually increased our sphere of influence (but not, I stress, our sphere of
_competence_) we have forgotten it. It is now commonplace for us to talk the
language of “global solutions”; to buy from global corporations; to consume
global news media; to judge our own lives via global comparison. All of these
things represent action at an inhuman scale and thus provoke inhuman
consequences – which are by definition unpredictable, because we do not have
the processing power to understand the complexity of what we are doing at that
level.

Recent conversations about how we might “rein in” the tech giants are a case
in point. They miss the fact that the dubious consequences of these companies
aren’t peculiar them as organisations; they are embedded in the _very concept
of the internet itself_. Information completely unbounded by geography betrays
all laws of scale, and therefore must produce outcomes completely beyond our
control.

Inhuman system, inhuman outcome.

Not to get _too_ philosophical here, but personally I find it interesting to
consider that there is not only a competence question here, but also one of
psychological health. If you think about it, you will notice that nature never
gives any creature knowledge that is beyond its physical capabilities. An
eagle can see for miles and has mastery over all it surveys, meanwhile a mole
can barely see at all and yet _also_ has mastery over all it surveys. Their
knowledge and capabilities “match”. What is going on beyond their sphere of
influence is of no concern to them, so their lives are inherently
_satisfying_. We of course have no such privilege; our vision and knowledge
far surpass our abilities, and as such we are forever aware of that which lies
out of reach. We are not only _acting_ at a scale that is beyond our
competence; we are also _thinking_ at such a scale too.

**So what’s the upshot of all this?**

In short, we must recognise that strategic behaviour should always be bound up
intimately with consideration of scale. We must always consider the scale we
are acting at, and adjust our plans accordingly – even if that means
contradicting our prior positions as scale changes.

This is why I always propose a “leading from behind” approach to [business
strategy](https://basicarts.org/why-most-businesses-have-no-strategy/). All
businesses, other than perhaps the most tiny, are beyond human scale. The
founder is not a puppet master; the business is out there doing things they
cannot see and cannot control. It is not bounded, it is free, and interwoven
with the outside world; a living thing more like an organism than an object.

This means the founder cannot hope to bend it precisely to their will, because
it is beyond their capacities to do so. It is too complex. Therefore they must
adopt the leadership style which is necessary for _all_ systems beyond human
scale, and that is to _facilitate_ it rather than control it. You must allow
it to be what it “wants” to be, rather than dictating what you think it
“ought” to be.

If helpful, you can imagine your leadership as something similar to being a
politician.

A sensible political leader, when elected to office in a particular country,
will recognise that that country has an organically evolved personality and
culture, which was “designed” by nobody. Their job is to simply _facilitate_
this culture, by removing barriers to its flourishing and cohesiveness. This
submissive form of leadership is of course why we call such politicians “civil
servants”. If on the other hand they wished to _transform_ the culture from
above we would call that totalitarianism, and it would look something like the
handiwork of Pol Pot. Imperialism is another example of this, where X culture
takes control of Y culture and seeks to remake it in its own image.

_(As an interesting aside I have read that many ancient empires didn’t seek to
do this, and were quite happy for the people they invaded to continue in their
own traditions. Whether this is because of wisdom or simply lacking the
technological means I’m not sure!)_

In any event, such humble facilitation is the best you can ever do when
operating at an inhuman scale. Seek first to _understand_ what you are
nurturing, and then help it flourish in its own image.

A beautiful word for this process, which you may find useful, is “husbandry”.
This is normally used to describe human care for natural resources, which
makes it a perfect analogy since we cannot remake nature as we please; we can
only support it on its own terms. As a founder or chief exec you too should
practice husbandry of your business, out of respect for its scale, and your
own limitations.

The one other way to tackle leadership at scale is _decentralisation_. When
you decentralise something you break it down from a large unwieldy unit, into
multiple human-scaled ones. Each of these then becomes manageable, provided
they remain oriented to the priorities of the larger “whole” of which they are
a part.

In politics this is exemplified by local governance; and in business it is
exemplified simply by the “department” – logistics, sales, marketing, etc. –
all of which of course need to harmonise under the will of the overall
business.

So there you have it – two scales, and two corresponding behaviours:

**Human scale (within our competence) – you may control and guide it**

**Inhuman scale (beyond our competence) – you follow it and nurture it**

Flow back and forth between these states, with constant sensitivity to which
is right at any given moment, and whatever you lead will become beautiful,
vibrant, and healthy.
