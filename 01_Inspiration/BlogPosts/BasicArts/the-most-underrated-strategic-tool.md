We are all cats in boxes.

This is an analogy I once heard (can’t remember where) which really speaks to
me, and has a lot of importance for smart and [strategic
thinking](https://basicarts.org/newsletter/).

Expanded, the concept is something like this. Imagine you have a cat in a box,
with air holes punched in it so it can breathe. When the cat looks out of
those holes, it’s able to get a pretty good idea of the environment
surrounding it – but naturally, the picture is incomplete. Now imagine there’s
another cat in another box right next to it. It is in exactly the same
situation; only out of its holes it can see a slightly different image of the
same environment. This means that although the two cats are _looking_ at the
same thing, they _see_ different things.

Clearly, these cats are an allegory for our own limited perspective on the
world before us. We are all looking at the same thing, but only partially;
through random little holes of clarity, with the majority totally obscured.

Just like the cats, if we want to get a more complete and true picture we need
to pool our knowledge. We need to add the view another person has through
their holes to our own – producing a still imperfect, but markedly more
complete picture of reality.

When we fail to do this, we arrive at the root of pretty much all conflict:
the assumption that what we see through our holes is “true”, and what others
see through their holes is “false”. This then leads to the central paradox at
the heart of almost every conflict: that nobody is wrong. In fact, both sides
are probably right. They are just looking at things through different “holes”.

_(As an aside I think this particular point is a truly powerful one. When you
start to realise that most debates don’t have a “right” side and a “wrong”
side and that in fact, both sides are right, you instantly understand them
much better.)_

In any case, the unavoidable incompleteness of our individual perspectives
leads me to the point of today’s piece:

**The power of the humble chat.**

Yes, I believe that the most powerful and underrated strategic tool that any
of us have at our disposal is this – preferably one-on-one, preferably
confidential, and preferably informal.

Many people underestimate the power of the chat thanks to its loose, everyday,
and “unprofessional” nature. They prefer instead analysis; workshops; number
crunching; exercises; etc. But whilst these often have their place, to me,
they are all basically corporate pastiches of the chat. Flawed attempts to add
veneers of respectability and science to the real sauce.

Chatting through a problem with someone supercharges your thinking. It is not
simply a question of “doubling the amount of information” at your disposal
because there are two of you (two cats = double the amount of holes). It’s
more like _squaring_ it because the interpersonal dynamic adds new dimensions
which you can’t achieve in other contexts.

Consider the following crucial characteristics which only chats have:

**1 – They are opinion-based**

I’ve referred to opinions before as “dynamic facts” since rather than being
the half-truths many people think they are, they are more like approximations
of how multiple facts interrelate. This makes them often more powerful than
the blunt one-dimensional information favoured by other forms of analysis. In
an informal chat, the currency tends to be largely opinion, and this means it
contains a uniquely high-quality form of information – providing you carefully
unpick it, and don’t take everything at face value.

**2 – They are candid**

The workplace (and indeed wider world) is of course ridden with hidden
political pressures, expectations, and codes of conduct. As a result, anything
with a whiff of formality about it is likely to become sanitised and diluted
to the point of uselessness. Nobody wants to risk the kind of controversial
thinking that actually makes change happen. In a chat, however (especially
when alcohol is involved) these restrictions are removed. Granted it’s hard to
remove them completely if, say, you’re the boss speaking to an employee. But
even so, taking things “off-record” can be powerful in any context.

**3 – They induce pressure to perform**

Although chats are low pressure in terms of their atmosphere, they are high
pressure in another way, and that is pressure to contribute. When there are
only two of you there’s no hiding. The silence must be filled. This of course
is a big part of the way talking therapy works. When you’re exposed and forced
to talk about yourself, with no way of wriggling out, interesting things will
eventually bubble to the surface. With chats, we can play the same game in a
business context.

**4 – They are open-ended**

Finally, a crucial way this underrated strategy tool differs from their more
structured brethren is that they don’t have a destination in mind. They are
free-wheeling; perhaps without a well-defined start or a clean and tidy end.
Granted this can make them pretty inefficient – lots of red herrings, blind
alleys, and rabbit holes. But it also makes them surprising, and surprise is
the very essence of [strategy](https://basicarts.org/).

Speaking for myself, although there are some more formal elements, I place
one-on-one chats at the very centre of every [strategic
project](https://basicarts.org/work-with-us/) I undertake. I would say they
are responsible for 75%+ of breakthroughs.

No leader with decision-making power should underestimate them.
