_A note before we begin: the below describes a trend which I’m sure is true,
but which would benefit from more research than I’ve had time to do. It
references certain brands only from an outside consumer perspective – and thus
does so perhaps a bit unfairly._

_But still I’m not a journalist or academic, and this newsletter is about
insight, not reportage, so it’ll have to do. I’m sure you’ll get my broader
point._

___

Like any closing-in-on-middle-age man, I’ve now reached the point in my life
where I like literally  _every_ piece of music from my adolescence.

At the time I hated most of it – my tastes, like most people’s, were much more
narrow and particular – but the passage of time has progressively widened
them, to the point now where I’ll happily listen to anything from B*Witched to
Placebo to Nelly. Anything that taps me into that time frankly. I’ll take it
all, I bloody love it.

The reason I bring up this self-indulgent reflection is because I think it
acts as a small example for how anything – not just music – achieves wider
adoption over time:

**It’s not the thing that changes to suit the audience; it’s the audience that
changes to suit the thing.**

This music has not changed in the slightest in the past 25 years. The only
thing that’s changed is me, and of course the culture surrounding the music.
These contextual changes have made me (and others) move  _towards_ music we
would have previously rejected, with the music itself remaining steady and
true to its original form.

I’d suggest that this same dynamic applies to anything seeking to move along
the adoption curve:

I’m sure you’re all familiar with this concept; how an idea gradually moves
from niche to mainstream, starting with the “innovators” (people who like to
try new things for their own sake), moving to “early adopters”, then “early
majority” as the mainstream starts to take hold, followed by the “late
majority” and finally the “laggards” (the sort of people who are still using
CDs and suchlike).

It’s a good model, but it has one big problem in it which is inherent to the
way I described it above: the concept of ideas  _moving along_ the curve.

This implies that the audience remains static, and it is the idea which
“travels”, but for the most part this is the opposite of what actually
happens. In reality the more true interpretation is that the idea remains
static, and the  _audience shifts_ beneath it.

To give a basic brand example, Apple didn’t move along the adoption curve by
adapting themselves to become more like Dell or Nokia, and therefore more
mainstream. No, instead the technology audience matured in a direction whereby
Apple became more mainstream over time,  _without_ changing. Apple didn’t go
to the audience, the audience went to Apple.

This isn’t to suggest that they didn’t have agency in their wider adoption,
nor that there was no strategy at play. Naturally they made smart bets on the
way the industry was going.

**No, the point is that Apple didn’t have to dilute themselves or dumb
themselves down in order grow.**

It’s basic law of attraction stuff. Chasing someone (a customer, an investor,
a romantic prospect), and being inauthentic in order to persuade them to get
with you is needy, desperate, and fundamentally ineffective.

But it’s something we’ve all been guilty of.

And moreover, something I’ve increasingly noticed brands doing.

One example I noted the other day was when Huel, the meal-replacement shakes
brand, was [forced to pull a series of
ads](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64637704) which attempted flog the
product as a remedy for the cost-of-living crisis. The details of the case are
fairly unimportant – basically they claimed a month’s worth of Huel would cost
£50 whereas the ASA said it would actually cost £350 – fine, whatever. What
matters for our purposes here is not the ban, but the overall game Huel were
trying to play.

These ads were clearly a blatant pitch to “mainstream” what has up to this
point been a fairy niche, even “cult” product. The thought process is pretty
transparent: “Ordinary people (early/late majority) aren’t buying our product,
so what do they care about that we can play on? Ah yes, the cost of living.
Let’s pitch ourselves as budget product”.

There’s nothing wrong with this ethically (assuming the sums add up), or
logically. It all seems very sensible. But where it falls down is in its
backward attempt to  _force_ progression along the adoption curve, but
corrupting what Huel has traditionally been all about (basically a premium and
progressive tech-bro life hack), in order to become something that they think
will have wider appeal to “normies”.

Now to be clear, I’m sure there is more to this Huel story than I’m aware of.
I don’t know anything about what’s going on within that particular company
other than what I observe as a consumer, so I don’t want to make this an
unfair criticism of them.

No, the point is only illustrative. That this is just one of  _many_ examples
that are emerging where exciting and innovative brands in the “early adopter”
phase are debasing themselves in order to “hack” quick growth.

I spotted another this week with this WeWork ad:

Again, there’s a sensible idea here. Why don’t we widen our appeal beyond
startup culture to include ordinary office workers who are bored of their
post-Covid work-from-home lifestyles? Yes, this is logical. But it also
undermines what that brand is (or used to be) about: creativity,
entrepreneurship, risk taking. Not just a glorified Starbucks, which is what
this is.

**What I’m sensing here is desperation.**

We’re seeing (theoretically) great brands who are early-ish on the adoption
curve starting to lose their nerve, and so make tin-eared and frankly somewhat
patronising pitches to ordinary folk who aren’t naturally aligned with their
innovations. (Or at least not yet).

Huel and WeWork aren’t outlying examples. To me they feel entirely
representative of a trend which is only going to grow stronger – as over-
invested “revolutionary” start-ups begin to panic as it becomes clear that
their pitch deck promises of world domination were perhaps a little
overstated.

We can probably trace this trend back to the moment when tech-logic began to
infect the world of bricks-and-mortar businesses, CPG brands, and so on. It
used to be that it was enough to simply build a hugely profitable and
sustainable company, that provided great value to its customers, its
employees, and its shareholders. Brands like Huel and WeWork both have that
potential with little bother. But then suddenly, it seemed that was no longer
enough. Nothing less than tech-style global disruption would do. It was’t
enough to be a mayonnaise; you had to be the “Uber of mayonnaise”. It wasn’t
enough to be a gym. You had to be the “Amazon of gyms”.

With these promises, the seeds of desperation were scattered. And now it seems
to me they’re starting to shoot.

Although I have no evidence for this, it wouldn’t remotely surprise me if Huel
had promised investors that it would “make food obsolete”, or if WeWork had
promised that it would “consolidate global office space under one umbrella”.
Such claims are now commonplace. The cost of doing business almost.

And who knows, perhaps they were, or even still are, achievable.

But  _only_ if they stood their ground, owned who they are, and let people
come to them.

_Only_ if they positioned themselves to profit from shifting cultural sands,
rather than abandoning that position in pursuit of an unfit audience.

_This is how adoption works._

And it’s also how brands maintain their dignity.
