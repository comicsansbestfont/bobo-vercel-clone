You’ve probably noticed that a lot of my writing focuses on the importance of
communication in strategy. Or, more specifically, _making your case_.

Standing in front of a group of people.  
Explaining your thinking.  
Laying out the plan.  
And getting them to enthusiastically agree.

Indeed, I have gone so far as to say that if you can do this, then the content
of the strategy doesn’t really matter – you’ll probably win anyway.

Now at first glance this sounds sort of ridiculous. How can we say that
spinning an enticing story about your strategy is more important than the
actually strategy itself? It doesn’t add up, it seems superficial – until,
that is, you realise just what is _required_ to spin such a story.

You see, you can’t even attempt a story without this:

**An idea.**

An actual novel, creative, thought with practical substance. Something to
pitch to people in the first place.

Most businesses don’t have this. I mean like 99% of them. We tend to believe
that the reason businesses is fail is because they were a “bad idea”, but
that’s not actually true. _Businesses fail because they aren’t an idea at
all_.

Look at these examples:

**Not an idea:** “An ad agency with great creative”.  
**An idea:** “An ad agency that does creative for free and makes its money on
production”.

**Not an idea:** “A sleek speciality coffee shop”.  
**An idea:** “A coffee shop that only sells flat whites”.

**Not an idea:** “A casual fashion brand”.  
**An idea:** “A fashion brand that only makes clothes for wet weather”.

Quite honestly I think all of those ideas I listed there would probably
succeed if executed well – and indeed probably a couple of them exist already.
And this was me thinking about it for like 2 minutes, these are not
particularly well considered (think I stole the coffee one from Rory
Sutherland’s “flat white and fuck off” idea actually).

But the “not an ideas”? Almost certainly they would fail, because there’s
nothing there – just as there is nothing there in the case of most businesses,
who only succeed because of contacts, graft, or sheer dumb luck.

People talk about the “survivorship bias” of outlier companies, but no, it’s
the ORDINARY companies that are examples of survivorship bias. They represent
the 1% of non-idea businesses that actually worked.

Bringing it back to the pitch of your strategy then, can you see how I could
easily construct an compelling pitch for the idea-businesses, but not for the
others. I mean what would I even say? “People love good coffee and so we’re
going to give it to them!”. Not exactly thrilling is it. But the argument for
the flat-white only one could have so many layers and angles to it:

  * It could be incredibly fast
  * It could be incredible stripped back and cheap to run
  * It could become famous
  * You could absolutely _nail_ that one type of coffee
  * It could be housed on a tiny premises that other cafes couldn’t
  * Etc etc.

This is why the quality of the story is the key metric in judging strategy –
because it shows that you actually have one in the first place!

Taking it one step further, you’ll note that my thesis doesn’t only require
you to have the story, but for it to be convincing. For the people you tell it
to to say “yeah, that sounds cool actually”. You don’t pass this test if
people say “I don’t get it”, or “yeah, errm, sounds kinda interesting”. This
is where you really get into _rarified_ territory, because if just getting an
idea is hard, getting a convincing one is even harder.

Just run the (somewhat made-up) maths here:

  * 99% of businesses are not an idea at all
  * 0.9% of businesses are an idea, but most people think it’s dumb
  * 0.1% of businesses are an idea, and people think it’s smart

That’s an incredibly high bar – a bar you only clear if you have a case you
can make, which people are excited about. Is it possible that after _all that_
the strategy is still shit? Yeah sure, but I’d suggest it’s unlikely.

_(Incidentally almost all of those 0.9% of “bad idea” businesses are tech
brands, who generally manage to cross the idea threshold, but are usually
pretty unconvincing)_

So with all that in mind, here’s a little exercise to consider. Explain your
business using this formulation:

“My idea is [_describe business_]”

In other words, frame it as an idea, not just a business. Can you even do it
without sounding absurd? Do you have the innovative meat to cross that
threshold?

To be honest I’m not sure I can do it for mine. Even though I have a good
strategy I think it falls short of this higher standard, so I’m going to think
on that.

I suggest you do too.
