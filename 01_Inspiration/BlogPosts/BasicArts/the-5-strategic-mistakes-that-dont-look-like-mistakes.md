One of the things that makes strategy tricky, is that it’s war against
yourself.

It’s not really a knowledge-based discipline, like engineering or medicine,
where you just have to know stuff. It’s more of a discipline of consistently
and relentlessly going _against_ your instincts, and what seems sensible at
that moment in time.

It’s sort of like that episode in _Seinfeld_ , where George’s life is going so
badly that he decides to simply do the opposite of whatever he thinks in any
given moment. After all, it can’t get any worse right? And of course,
predictably, his counterintuitive choices all work out beautifully.

Yup, strategy’s kinda like that.

And this is why we see founders and CEOs constantly making the same mistakes.
_Because they don’t realise they’re mistakes_. They think they’re doing the
right, sensible, and logical thing.

(But right, sensible, and logical is rarely the way.)

Here then are the most common “seemingly right but actually wrong” things I’ve
seen my clients do over the years.

Recognise any?

## I. Selling with “purpose”

You don’t find that many brands these days that don’t have some sort of noble
or virtuous purpose guiding their behaviour. It’s perhaps slightly on the
wane, but there was a time when it seemed like people had forgotten that it’s
OK for a brand to just be fun, or cool, or helpful, without solving the sins
of the world.

Still, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with purpose – indeed it can be great
for galvanising the team, and of course for making positive things happen in
the world. But what _is_ wrong is believing that people will buy from you
_because_ of it.

Get this straight: _nobody cares except you_. Or at least you should act like
that’s the case, because otherwise you’ll tether your financial performance to
your customer’s moral compass – and that’s a road to ruin.

The truth is that the market is driven by fundamentally selfish desires, and
even the most purposeful brands out there are selling by appealing to these
desires you examine them critically. So the same goes for you. If you want
your purpose to actually happen, you must first ensure that the commercial
strategy driving your business taps into these less virtuous forces.

Being “nice” is not a free pass to avoid the same tough strategic thinking as
everyone else.

## II. Sticking with your vision

When you’re building a company, you’re actually really building two of them:

  * The one you think you’re building
  * The one you’re _actually_ building

The first corresponds to the plan or vision you had in your head. The thing
you wanted to make, solving the problem you wanted to solve. The second
corresponds to how the outside world _interprets_ the business, and how it
manipulates it to solve _different_ problems.

Understand, this dichotomy is _always_ at play, at least in part. There are
always these two businesses there, it’s unavoidable.

The mistake here is cleaving too closely to your version of the business, and
being unaware that the other version exists. This is especially problematic
since it is that other version that _makes money_. That is the “real” business
– your vision is just a chimera. A mirage. Something that may excite you but
which in truth doesn’t really exist.

Your goal should be to unify your vision with the truth of the business that
is emerging. To get on board with it and serve it – no matter how much it
deviates from what you wanted to build.

Trust me, no matter how great your original idea was, this one is better.

## III. Talking about yourself more than the customer

OK people don’t exactly think this one is a “good idea”, but it’s just so damn
natural that they can’t help it anyway.

It is _insane_ how pervasive this “me me me” style of communication is when
you consider how often we’re told that it’s bad and ineffective. But I guess
old narcissistic habits die hard; we talk about the thing that matters to us,
and that is us. While our customers only want to hear about the thing that
matters to them, and that is them.

I heard a superb analogy about this from Donald Miller, who said that the
customer is James Bond, and your brand is Q. This really nails the dynamic you
want to create here, both on terms of who the hero is in the relationship, and
the ratio of attention each party deserves.

Roughly I would suggest making all your comms like this:

You  
You  
You  
You  
You  
Me  
You  
You

You can literally fill in the blanks there with your comms and see massive
dividends – even before you’ve done any more fundamental strategic thinking.
It’s just such an insanely easy win that you’d be crazy to let it slide.

## IV. Focusing on the customer for strategic insight

Hold up – we just said we should be focusing in the customer in our comms, but
now we’re saying we _shouldn’t_ be focusing on them for our strategy?

That’s right.

The customer should be the relentless focus of all comms, BUT they will _not_
be your best source of strategic insight, and they will _not_ tell you how you
should direct your company, _nor_ what role you should occupy in the market.

The reason for this is simple: pretty much all of the obvious needs of your
customers will already be adequately served by the market. Everyone is asking
them what they want, and trying to give it to them, so the chances that a
lucrative opportunity has been “missed” is gonna be razor slim (though it does
sometimes happen).

You need to uncover new opportunities and unimagined needs that customers
could never tell you – and the way to do that is to focus on your
_competitors_. Competitors define the landscape and context; they tell you
what spaces are taken and what spaces are open; and by bouncing off them and
counter-signalling them you can come up with fresh strategic ideas.

Now of course many of these ideas won’t be high value to customers (there’s no
point in just being different for the sake of it), but if you examine the
ideas for _potential_ customer value you’re likely to find something. And that
something will be something fresh which you could never have discovered merely
by listening to them.

## V. Trying to be better than your competitors

Finally one of my greatest hits, but it bears endless repeating:

The market does not reward better, it only rewards different.

Better is a synonym for “the same”, because it explicitly presupposes that the
two things being compared are designed for the same job (which is the
yardstick for determining “betterness” in the first place). If the job is
different, then the concept of “better” becomes meaningless. What’s better, a
Birkin bag or a paper bag? Better for what? It’s a dumb question.

Because of this implicit sameness, the market will simply bundle the two
things being compared into the same sludge – and the winner will not be the
one that is marginally “superior”; it will probably just be the one with more
money, greater availability, and greater name recognition.

The business graveyard is overflowing with solutions which were “better” – and
if you try that game, you’ll likely join them.

Tricky isn’t it?

All that good sense, all those natural decisions, and yet each one only
serving to imperceptibly suck you into the quicksand of commodification.

The price of escape is either extreme vigilance or natural contrarianism (or
ideally both).

But on the plus side, if you manage it, you know you’ll be in a pretty
exclusive club.
