“For there is nothing either good or bad,  
but context makes it so”.

– _Not quite William Shakespeare, but close enough_

___

Back in the days before they moved to the Emirates stadium and became mid-
table dreck, Arsenal had a player called Freddie Ljungberg. Ljungberg has
always held a particular fascination for me and my pals, as his career was
marked by a spectacular drop-off in form when he moved from Arsenal to another
Premier League club, West Ham United, in 2007.

Pretty much overnight he went from being one of the finest players the league
had ever seen, to a nondescript journeyman who wasn’t able to hold down a
place in a far inferior team. After one undistinguished season at the Hammers
he threw in the towel and moved to the States to play for the Seattle Sounders
– a new low where once again he failed to stand out.

Now of course players lose a level or two as they get older, but Ljungberg was
only 30 when he moved to West Ham; an age when many are hitting their peak. As
a result we are left with a bit of a mystery: how could he be one of the best
players for a top team, but then a couple of months later _not_ be good enough
for a lesser team?

The answer is what I want to talk about in today’s piece, namely:

**How by changing the context of something, you change its qualities.**

What does this mean?

Well, we are used to thinking of things – people, businesses, objects, etc. –
as having fixed and objective qualities. To use Ljungberg as an example, in
2006 we may have thought of him as a “top class footballer” – and indeed he
was. Based on this belief, it was logical to assume that he would be a top
class footballer wherever you put him – and indeed that his abilities would
only become more pronounced when placed amongst inferior players. In the event
however it appeared that the opposite was true: that his level of mastery
wasn’t “baked into him”, but was rather _activated by a particular context_
(playing for Arsenal) – and that when removed from that context his level
totally changed.

In other words Ljungberg had a particular “bag of qualities” which manifested
as _one thing_ in one context, and as _another thing_ in another. By moving
clubs he became a totally different player even though he was exactly the same
person. Intrinsically he was neither master nor fool; he was instead _dynamic
potential_ which could take on different forms depending on the external
frame.

**This idea is important because it doesn’t just apply to Ljungberg – it
applies to everything and everyone.**

Our performance and status is always dictated by two things:

  1. Our inherent qualities
  2. How those qualities interact with our present context

This means that if we want to change our performance and status we have two
levers to pull: the obvious one, which is to change ourselves, and the less
obvious one, which is to change our context.

Typically we put far too much emphasis on the former and not enough on the
latter. If we or our business are in a bad spot our first instinct is always
to think about how we can improve, and what we can do differently. We rarely
think about whether perhaps we are just fine, and that it is the context (or
“frame”) that needs to be changed in order to unlock our potential.

Thinking about this in terms of my projects with clients, I would say that the
solutions are generally a blend of around 50% changing the business and 50%
changing the context.

There is an almost magical quality to this, as it is often impossible to
unpack all the subtle ways that framing can allow something to flourish.
Returning to Ljungberg, if his variability had been down to something basic
like being played in a different position, then there would have been no
mystery. However there is so much more that may go into it:

  * His relationship with the players around him
  * The nature of the coaching sessions
  * The dimensions of the pitch
  * The differing attitude of opponents to his new club
  * His emotional response to playing for West Ham rather than Arsenal
  * Etc.

This isn’t to say that these were all important – who knows, maybe it was just
that he had a longer commute to work or something – it’s simply to say that we
cannot fully understand.

Similarly when I worked with the cereal bar brand Eat Natural, who have now
sold to Ferrero, we discovered that their performance was highly variable to
the context they were sold in. A particular strength relative to their
competitors was their performance in “dirty” convenience channels – things
like train stations, motorway service stations, vending machines, corner shops
and the like. I could write you an essay on why that might be – the
competitive set, the type of shopper, the need states, the influence of price,
times of day with high traffic, visibility, etc. etc. – but suffice to say
it’s beyond our ability to grasp completely.

Bottom line an Eat Natural bar is a _different product_ on a station platform
than it is in the cereal bar aisle of a big Tesco, just as Ljungberg was a
_different player_ at West Ham.

Finally let’s not forget the personal in all this. Each and every one of us,
just like these two, are bags of qualities which have the potential to thrive
or wither in different contexts. This is much bigger than simply matching our
abilities with our tasks – doing jobs we’re good at etc. It’s more a question
of being in a context where we are “activated” or “deactivated” in a holistic
sense; where we feel a sense of mastery, or flow.

We are different people day to day, moment to moment, depending on where we
are and what we’re up to. So if we want to change, it’s good to remember that
context is the easiest way to do it.
