Believe it or not, strategy is meant to make things easy. And the key to
making things easy always boils down to this:

  * Transforming an ambition into an _act_

This applies to anything really. “Losing weight” (an ambition) is hard,
because you might not know where to begin. But “stop eating sugar” (an act) is
theoretically easy because it’s just something you do, which happens to result
in losing weight. It removes the ambiguity and the overwhelm of options, and
leaves you with a relatively simple task.

This then is basically what any strategy should look like – a singular act in
place of a broad ambition. Lovely.

Today, inspired by a newsletter from Roger Martin on a similar subject, I
wanted to use this “ambition into act” technique to explain business growth.

Growth is obviously an ambition, and a vague and intimidating one at that. But
it can actually be broken down into three possible acts, each of which are
much more approachable. It doesn’t exactly render the task “easy”, but it
certainly makes it more straightforward.

So I’m going to briefly list them, and then explain how regardless of which
you choose, the strategic approach to each should be _exactly_ the same.

## The 3 ways to grow

So, no matter which way you cut it, these are pretty much your options:

  1. Get people to spend more with you
  2. Get more people to enter your market
  3. Expand into new verticals

Let’s break them down quickly:

**Get people to spend more with you** – This just means increasing the amount
of profit you can squeeze from the average customer. Note, this _doesn’t_ mean
getting more customers from your competitors (increasing unit market share).
That is _not_ a viable form of growth because it encourages commodifying
behaviour. It may happen as a by-product, but it shouldn’t be pursued for its
own sake. Instead this approach simply means maximising the customers you
have. This might come from upselling, or increasing willingness to spend more
via brand or whatever, or increasing repeat purchase.

**Get more people to enter your market** – So this is classic “grow the pie”
behaviour where you find ways to bring people into your category who aren’t
currently shopping it. Again, this does _not_ mean stealing your competitors’
customers; it means selling to people who aren’t _anyone’s_ customers. Martin
put this really nicely: “convince women to drink whiskey, get men to use
fragrances, and adults to assemble Lego”.

**Expand into new verticals** – Finally the most difficult and high risk
approach, pushing your brand into a new market, like Apple entering phones for
instance. Not many brands manage to straddle multiple categories like this
since generally it involves an entirely new skillset under the hood, even if
the move might make sense from an external “brand perspective”.

You can see then, that when you get granular like this, it isn’t actually too
hard to come up with ways you might grow. I think that if you spend literally
60 seconds thinking about your business in line with each of the above topics,
you’ll probably come up with some interesting ideas you’ve never thought of
before.

Now some of these will be little tactical ideas which might have the potential
to deliver you, say, 5% growth. Assuming these are easy to execute you might
as well do them – why not?

But what about more “strategic” ideas in these categories, which have the
potential to delver 2x, 5x, or even 10x change. How do we come up with these?

Well this is where unique value comes in.

In order to generate and identify genuinely _powerful_ ideas within these
categories, you basically need a strategic yardstick to see:

  1. What would be right for your business specifically
  2. What would deliver competitive advantage

The unique value your business exists to deliver to the world _is_ that
yardstick. If you have it you can use it as the “brief” for these different
forms of growth, which will not only help you spit out good ideas, but will
also ensure those ideas are congruent with everything else you’re doing – thus
helping build a vivd and coherent brand.

So for a basic example, if we imagine IKEA and their unique value offering of
“making designer interiors accessible”, we can easily come up with a couple of
on-strategy ideas for them:

**Get people to spend more with you** – bundle products into “design families”
where the shopper will want to build out the set.

**Get more people to enter your market** – create a line of attractive
furniture for people with mobility issues, so they aren’t limited to “hospital
chic” in their homes.

**Expand into new verticals** – go beyond furniture into homewares and
kitchens.

Pretty straight forward stuff, IF (and that’s a big if) you have a clear
understanding of the value you’re going to own.

So now you can see how, when chunked down, strategic growth is actually pretty
manageable process. Identify your unique value, then explore how that can be
leveraged to make people spend more, bring new people into the category, and
potentially move coherently into new verticals.

Kinda makes you wonder why we aren’t all billionaires, doesn’t it?
