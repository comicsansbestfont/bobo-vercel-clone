Haven’t our mothers always told us that the best way to get people to like us
is simply to be ourselves?

The wisdom of this old cliché can take a long time to dawn on us, but at some
point in our lives we tend to wake up to the fact that nothing is less
attractive than trying to be something we’re not; and any type of person can
be cool so long as they occupy that type wholly and with integrity.

It seems, however, that no matter how old brands get, this realisation never
quite hits them; even if they have their very own Mother advising them, as is
the case with KFC.

The fried chicken titan is currently witnessing its ‘Whole Chicken’ ad [rack
up complaints](http://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/07/31/asa-complaints-about-
kfcs-the-whole-chicken-ad-could-exceed-400-investigation) for a hodgepodge of
reasons, chief among which seems to be a belief that the ad, which touts food
quality and provenance credentials, isn’t an accurate reflection of who the
brand really is. It’s not so much that it’s offensive in a Protein World kind
of way; it’s more like a teenager ordering a martini or your dad calling
something ‘jokes’… void of authenticity.

It’s easy to see how it ended up here, as it’s a trick attempted by countless
brands, and it is perhaps just KFC’s bad fortune that it seems to be getting
burned for it when most offenders pass under the radar.

Essentially what happens is that an otherwise successful company identifies a
chink in their armour – say a particular negative perception people have, or
an audience they lack penetration with – and sets out to remedy it with an ad.
In KFC’s case, clearly it realised that people don’t think the company uses
high quality chicken, and it figured that by fixing this it would open itself
up to a whole new (more discerning) audience.

Seems to make sense right? The problem with this approach, this belief that a
brand can be all things to all people if it just covers all the bases in its
comms, is that it flies directly in the face of reality. Every brand has
specific strengths and weaknesses, which serve a particular market purpose,
often with the weaknesses being essential compromises to make the strengths
more powerful. Trying to “have it all” and shrug off those weaknesses is
wishful thinking, and makes you end up looking foolish.

Imagine for instance if some bright spark working for Cosmopolitan suddenly
said: “Hey, guys, I just realised that we currently only cater to 50% of the
market, but if we target our next ad at men then we’ll capture 100%!”. Pretty
dumb right? And yet that’s kind of what KFC and hundreds of other brands try
to do every day: build their brand on the one thing that they are,
categorically, not good at.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure KFC has good food quality for its category. Do
KFC chickens have better welfare than those of the average chicken shop?
Probably. But that’s not much of a platform for a major brand campaign is it?
This is evidenced by the fairly meagre promise that it only uses chicken in
its products. I doubt the majority of people think KFC uses raccoons and
asbestos in its chicken.

Thus we are left with the bizarre marketing scenario of a brand putting its
worst foot forward to try and remedy an issue that essentially doesn’t matter
to its real target market. It’s an unappetising brief to give an agency, and
yet agencies are subjected to these briefs every day, briefs that ignore the
realities of the product in a cynical attempt to gobble up more market share
without earning it first.

What’s the alternative?

The smart approach – but a rare one outside of the most enlightened of brands
– is to clearly identify what you are for, and in doing so come to terms with
what you are not.

KFC ultimately sells cheap chicken. Its cheapness is an absolutely essential
attribute of what makes the company successful. The compromise is that its
chicken is never going to be the highest quality. Consumers who like buying
cheap chicken know this and live with it. Consumers who want quality, well,
they don’t eat at KFC. And that’s just fine, let them be. Ironically, KFC is
currently running a parallel campaign that mocks food provenance purists and
the wider clean eating trend in a way that actually feels very right for the
brand. But it sits very strangely with the ‘Whole Chicken’ campaign.

If that doesn’t sound appealing, there is one final option. Don’t like
something about your brand? Change it – for real. Brands aren’t primarily
built by advertising, they’re build by fact. If you want to change your
positioning, then you have to change your business, not your messaging. If KFC
pivoted to be all about chicken welfare then naturally it could take some
pretty radical steps to prove it, just as if Cosmo wanted to attract blokes it
could start writing stuff they want to read.

Of course, it would ruin its current brand position. But hey, it can always
run an ad to fix that, right?
