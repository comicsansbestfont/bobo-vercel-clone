Historically, I’ve kinda thought that goals for businesses are a waste of
time.

After all, aren’t the goals always the same?

• To grow  
• To increase profits  
• To get more customers  
• Etc.

It’s all so obvious it goes without saying, so I’ve preferred to “cut out the
middle man” and just jump straight to the more fundamental question of:

“How can we make this business the most healthy, thriving, high value version
of itself it can be?”

No goal required.

However, recently, I’ve started to change my view on this slightly. Although I
still think that goals are unnecessary for a business when developing
strategy, I’ve come to realise that they may still be useful if done right.

• Great goals can provoke great strategy  
• Great goals can also fuel strategic execution  
• And, just as importantly, bad goals can provoke bad strategy

So in this piece I want to explain the difference between a _strategic goal_
(i.e. a goal that supports a great strategy), and a _tactical goal_ (i.e. a
goal that undermines strategy), so that you can start using goals effectively.

You don’t _have_ to set goals, but recently I have. And to be honest, the
result has been magical.

Let’s get to it.

There are three key ways in which a (bad) tactical goal and a (good) strategic
goal differ:

**Tactical goals — > have known solutions**  
**Strategic goals — > have unknown solutions**

**Tactical goals — > are achieved by doing “more”**  
**Strategic goals — > are achieved by doing “different”**

**Tactical goals — > are piecemeal**  
**Strategic goals — > are holistic**

In the abstract this is probably pretty confusing, so let me illustrate it
with a pair of non-business examples which neatly show the difference:

**Tactical goal: Lose 20lbs**  
**Strategic goal: Become a movie star**

First up, let’s think about how we would go about achieving each one of these
goals. To lose weight, the solution is _known_. Just eat less, exercise more,
or do some variation of this, and you’ll get your result. Also note how not
only is the solution here _known_ , but it also relies on doing something
you’re already doing _more_ (or _less_ in the case of eating). It’s simply a
question of turning the dials; increasing the effort to increase the output.

Finally, in the context of your whole life, it’s also a pretty narrow
ambition. You don’t have to change “everything”; you just need to tweak a
couple of relatively minor things (diet and exercise) to get what you want.

**Known.**  
**More.**  
**Piecemeal.**

This is the definition of tactical.

Now compare that to becoming a movie star. Here, the solution is _not_
obvious. It is _not_ known. There is no tried and tested path to follow here.
Every movie star became a movie star in a different way, which was highly
particular to their individual context. Not only that, but if you’re an
ordinary person, you’re probably going to have to change your behaviour
radically to achieve this goal. You can’t do it by continuing what you’re
doing now, “but a little bit more”. You’re going to have to take some bold,
speculative punt. And chances are, that’s going to involve shifting your
_whole life_. You’re gonna have to move to a new place, hang out with new
people, get a new day job, learn new skills – the entire ship is going to have
to turn.

**Unknown.**  
**Different.**  
**Holistic.**

That is the definition of strategic.

Now then, if we apply this same logic to business, we can see how your choice
of goals can have a constructive or destructive effect.

If you set a tactical goal, you will come up with a tactical solution. An
example of a tactical goal in a business setting might be something like
“increase rate of sale”, or “get more distribution”, or “grow 20%”, or
something like this.

All of these goals can be achieved by _pushing harder_. Expending more labour,
more sweat, more cash, in pursuit of marginal gains. This is _not strategic_ ,
and indeed there is no strategy required. This is precisely why most business
have no strategy, and are perfectly content that way: because they are setting
tactical goals, with tactical solutions, and are simply grinding their way to
their mediocre vision of “success”.

But if you set a strategic goal? Then grinding isn’t gonna cut it.

A strategic goal is something with an unknown solution – which is precisely
why you need a “strategy” of course! The “strategy” is the _proposed_ solution
to the problem. Examples of strategic goals might be change-based (e.g.
transition the world to electric vehicles), or they might be based on
_extreme_ growth (e.g. get a pair of our shoes in every household in the
country, or grow 10x in one year). In either case “what got you here isn’t
going to get you there”, hence why you need a strategy.

_(It’s worth noting that growth goals can be tactical or strategic. The
difference is simply the scale of the ambition. “Realistic” growth goals are
tactical because you can see a path, and “unrealistic” ones are strategic
because you can’t.)_

As you can see then:

Tactical goals will smother strategy.  
Strategic goals will provoke it.

Having trouble coming up with a good strategy? Then set a bigger goal. Set a
goal you can’t possibly reach the way you’re going right now. The chasm you’ve
opened before you will call forth the need for a strategy, and your brain will
kick into the right gear.

Beyond this technical advantage of strategic goals is a psychological one:

**Strategic goals are exciting.**

They turn you on. They turn your team on. They are motivational and
inspirational. And that stuff counts.

Speaking for myself, a few months ago I set just such a strategic goal for my
business (when before I had no particular goals at all). And the results have
been kinda magical – mystical even.

By laying out an unreasonable goal and focussing on it, it’s almost like the
universe has shifted to allow it as a possibility. Or, if you’d prefer a less
woo-woo explanation, my own perspective has become more strategic as my mind
has grappled to bridge the arbitrary chasm I’ve created.

Perhaps then it’s a chronic lack of ambition that’s to blame for the chronic
lack of strategy we see around us? If you don’t create the _need_ for the
strategy, then you won’t create the strategy.

So decide what you want.

The mediocre tactical?  
Or the extraordinary strategic?

And then set your goals accordingly.
