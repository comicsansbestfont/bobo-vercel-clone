As you may recall, I believe strategy has two jobs:

1\. To decide what to do  
2\. To motivate people to actually do it

The first is well understood, the second, not so much. People believe that
good ideas should speak for themselves, and that energy will build behind a
solid plan – but this is naive. Millions of wasted words have been spilled in
boardrooms around the world detailing great strategies which ultimately never
happened.

The problem is that nine times out of ten, nobody really gives a shit. So your
responsibility as a strategic leader pretty clear: _make them_.

Make them care.  
Make them notice.  
Make them want to do it.

But how?

I talk about this topic a lot, but I’ve never really broken down _how_ you
make a strategy motivating, so I thought I’d try and give a few pointers here.

The crux is this:

**Style.**

It’s not a word we normally associate with strategy. I don’t think I’ve ever
heard someone talk about “strategy style”, although I dare say I’m not the
first. But when you think about it, all other things being equal, style is
what counts.

Let’s say you have a strategy “S”. This is outline of what you’re going to do,
and it’s fixed. So naturally you assume you’ve done your job, right? But you
haven’t. You see that strategy can still be explained in various different
ways – let’s say with the styles “ _x_ ”, “ _y_ ”, and “ _z_ ”.

This means then that you don’t have just one strategy, you potentially have
three:

Sx  
Sy  
Sz

The same idea, presented in three different ways – potentially yielding
_wildly_ different levels of buy-in and effectiveness.

See how important this is?  
See how the strategy itself is only half the battle?

You’ve gotta get the sizzle right. You’ve gotta lay on the style.

So, what then is the correct style? Well, first I’ll tell you what it isn’t.
It isn’t “simplicity” – even though that’s what people think it is. In fact
I’d say that the fetishisation of simplicity has arguably done more harm than
good.

Now of course, simple is better than complex. And of course, a good strategy
must be simple. But the problem is that if you _target_ simplicity with your
strategy you’re also likely to end up with something that’s:

• Dry  
• Dull  
• Overly obvious

You’ll end up with the strategy equivalent of a piece of dry toast. Undeniably
simple, undeniably sound, but with zero charisma.

**No, what you should be aiming for isn’t to be simple, but to be
interesting.**

Interesting _includes_ simplicity within it (because complex = boring), but
has so much more besides. By its very definition it catches the attention,
stops people in their tracks, and invites them to look closer.

It’s not the only thing that matters with strategy style, but it’s probably
the main one, since without interest, nothing else is going to land.

Here are three ways you can take any strategy, and make it more interesting:

## I. Show opinion

A colossal error people make when presenting strategy is to attempt to make it
as “objective” as possible. This comes from the utterly heinous association
people make between strategy and science – two things which have a similar
vibe, but which are in fact at opposite ends of the philosophical spectrum.

Strategy – _all strategy_ – is never more than a punt. It’s what you do when
you have no certainty. When you have nothing “scientifically verifiable”. If
you had such a thing it would’t be a “strategy”, it would be a “solution”. You
don’t need a “strategy” to stop a bridge falling down, you _know_ how to do
that. Strategy is what you use when you _don’t_ know.

Now, because all strategy is a punt, that also means all strategy is an
_opinion_. It’s your opinion on what we should do.

**Don’t apologise for this, own it.**

Lace your argument with terms like “I think”, and “maybe”, and “what if”, and
“it’s my opinion that…”. This isn’t just intellectually honest, it’s also
compelling.

• It humanises the strategy  
• It positions you as a leader, as an authority  
• And it encourages you to highlight more interesting and lateral evidence to
make your case; stuff you’ve intuited, not just dull lifeless facts

You are not some boffin, explaining the results of their equations. You are
Napoleon, standing on the brow of a hill before battle, and backing your own
genius.

Opinion makes this so.

## II. Be radically honest

This point is both stylistically important _and_ technically important for
creating a decent strategy in the first place.

Basically the absence of good strategy in most organisations can often be
attributed to the presence of _lies_. Things people in the organisation
_pretend_ are true, but know in their heart (and admit in the pub) to be
false. Things like:

• Our competitors are crap  
• Our customers care about the things we care about  
• Our product is the best  
• Etc.

Strategic breakthroughs regularly occur because someone (generally an
outsider) has the courage or tactlessness to call one of these lies out. Then
the _real_ situation can finally be observed, and a plan made accordingly.

Therefore I expect that somewhere within your strategy there is a challenge to
a lie. A bit of truth telling. Something that’s gonna scare the horses.

**Again, don’t disguise this, amplify it.**

Call the business out. Say what needs to be said. This has gigantic stylistic
benefits, because not only is it naturally arresting and attention grabbing,
but it also sparks recognition in people. You’ll get them saying stuff like:

“Finally someone’s said it”  
“Yes that’s what I’ve been saying for years”  
“You’ve put into words what I’ve always felt”

The second you hear this, you’ve won. It becomes their strategy, not yours.

So effective is the style of honesty that I’d even encourage you to _engineer_
it into your strategy even when there isn’t a lie you’re confronting. Act like
you’re being provocative. Act like you’re saying the unsayable. People dig
this shit.

And thus, people will dig a strategy that does it too.

## III. Master rhythm

Now I admit this one requires a touch more talent, and is difficult to learn,
but you may as well be conscious of it at the very least.

Effective communication (including communication of a strategy) has rhythm. It
has musicality; ebb and flow; narrative structure; all that good stuff.

Rhythm is the difference between being a good writer and a good copywriter.
The former can coherently string together information. The latter can express
information in a way that’s easier to consume than ignore – a _rare_ skill.

You should have rhythm in your presentation of the strategy. You should have
rhythm in your write up of the strategy. And you should even have rhythm in
the name of your strategy. Everything needs artistry.

Perhaps you could hire someone to do this for you – a “storytelling expert” or
some such. I’ve never heard of anyone doing this, but I think it could be a
good idea. However in the absence of that you might want to think about:

• **Narrative structure**. Classic hero’s journey stuff (although don’t cleave
to it too tightly otherwise it might mess up your argument). What’s the status
quo? Why does this suck? What thrilling secret have you noticed / realised?
How might this change things? So what are we going to do? That’s the basic
structure of all strategic argument.

•**Expressive language**. Yes, we all understand that “jargon is bad”. That’s
a given. But it’s also bad to be _too_ plain in your language as well. You
want to be a _bit_ flowery, just not in a corporate manner. Allow some
humanity, some exuberance, some poetry into your strategy – even if it makes
it longer. Don’t be a slave to brevity. (But equally, only expand in the
interests of deeper clarity, not to add complexity).

• **Hooks**. We all know about the importance of hooks in ads, social media
content, clickbait, etc., but frankly they’re important in all comms
everywhere. Ask curiosity-stoking questions, make contrarian statements, use
manipulative words like “secret”, “surprising”, stuff like that.

I wouldn’t advise plotting this kind of thing _too_ consciously, because it
will probably give you some sort of paralysis and make things too unnatural.

However just being aware of the general idea should subconsciously loosen you
up, and scare you away from the decidedly unrhythmical rubbish that most
people churn out.

___

You know it’s funny – we’re a generation that has been bred to worship
simplicity; in no small part because of the legacy of Steve Jobs and Apple.
Simplicity, we’re told, was his genius. And so we see cack-handed attempts to
mimic it wherever we look.

But when you think about it, simplicity _wasn’t_ his genius. That’s a red
herring.

His genius was _poetry_. Poetry and style.

That’s what’s really lacking from business today. So let’s do our best to fix
it.
