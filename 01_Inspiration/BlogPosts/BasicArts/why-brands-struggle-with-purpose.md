purpose/)._

There’s only one thing more common than brands talking purpose these days, and
that’s brands without one.

Keith Weed, CMO of Unilever, made an impassioned call in [The
Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/mar/21/unilever-keith-
weed-brands-sustainable-business) recently for brands to place purpose “at the
core of the brand, driving everything it does”. But those of us who work with
brands (or indeed, live with them) will know how far that ideal is from
reality across the marketplace.

His piece gave us a clue as to why that might be. He advised that any brand
thinking about this issue should simply go for it, saying “you won’t know
exactly how it’s going to go at first, but don’t be scared to learn along the
way”. Now I agree, that’s an admirable sentiment. But it’s not the kind of
advice that security-minded marketing directors are likely to base their 2017
[strategic thinking](https://basicarts.org/newsletter/) around. The truth is
that authentic purpose remains nebulous, the kind of ‘you’ve either got it or
you haven’t’ magic reserved for Jobs-like visionaries rather than something a
generic brand can simply buy.

A central reason for this is that true brand purpose tends to come from
within, whilst most brands outsource their identity to agencies. Patagonia
never had to hire a consultant to tell them who they are, and that’s why they
get purpose; the average brand has no idea and their agencies can’t change
that. This isn’t to say that agencies are incapable, it’s just that internal
change is never part of their remit. And if it’s not internal and integral to
the brand’s operations, then it’s not purpose.

So what can we do to change this?

We can’t rely on every brand to do it themselves, for every CMO to become a
mini Steve Jobs, orienting their whole business around their vision. We have
to come to a solution which works within the current paradigm of brands and
agencies working together – where the output is not ads, but business change.

The way to do this is to speak the language of the industry and create a new
discipline. This means identifying what, on a practical level, creates
‘purpose’, and then allowing this to be sold as a product like social or
shopper marketing.

The ingredients of the discipline would be simple – brand identity manifested
through internal company change, rather external campaigns. The creation of an
interesting business, rather than interesting ads. It would need a name, as
only then could it get traction in the market the way ‘social’ has over the
last decade or so. I would suggest ‘basic’, implying the crucial truth of this
approach: that it’s something fundamental – something that should be nailed
before other types of marketing, not an afterthought.

This crucial service could spawn specialist agencies, budget lines, award
categories, even trade bodies. In this world, a sound purpose could be as
accessible to a brand as a Facebook page, only far more important for both the
brand and the world around them.

Powerful voices like Keith Weed and others like him have the ability to align
and create this new reality. Only then will purposeful brands become the norm,
not the exception.
