It’s not every day that I come across a new idea in this field which stops me
in my tracks, but I heard something recently that did just that. I’m
paraphrasing but it was along the lines of:

**Marketing is the barrier you put up between yourself and the world.**

This is epic, so let me break it down a bit.

Generally we consider marketing ([meaning the modern comms-oriented version of
it](https://us16.campaign-
archive.com/?u=dbfcfcd097fd0818275a2b8b8&id=d629d6f379)) to be something like
the “best presentation of ourselves”. This is the version of us and of our
brands which is the most vivid, interesting, and attractive. Almost like an
enhanced image of what we are, and what we’re selling.

However the above idea totally upends that notion.

What it suggests instead is that our marketing – the external image of
ourselves that we send out into the world – is in fact more of a “shield” than
an amplification; something we “hide behind” rather than expose ourselves
with. It’s a safe and timid representation of our true nature, that we think
(or hope) will be acceptable to other people. Rather than being bold and
confident it’s fundamentally insecure – a deeply compromised shadow which is
built by our deepest desires to play it safe, avoid risks, and deflect
criticism.

This strikes me as staggeringly insightful.

As with most of the things we discuss here it can be applied to both an
individual and a brand. The idea is that the common disease often shared by
both is a crippling lack of confidence in who they are and what they’re doing
which leads to:

  1. Copying others (safety in numbers and all that)
  2. Hedging your bets (trying to play all sides rather than committing to one)
  3. A subconscious shrinking from attention (even in something like marketing which is all about getting attention)
  4. Ultimately blending in (sheltering you from criticism, yes, but also from any form of extraordinary achievement)

By contrast we might say that a truly confident brand (or person), rather than
having “good marketing presentation” actually has  _no marketing
presentation_. It has no barrier, no filter, between itself and the market. No
propaganda department. It is what it is: unequivocally, and unmistakably.

Indeed I’m prepared to go out on a limb here and say that the defining
difference between the great brands everyone loves, and the vast morass nobody
gives a shit about, is simply this. Confidence. Confidence in who they are,
and zero hesitation in expressing it to its fullest extent.

This advantage doesn’t only accrue because confidence and authenticity are
“attractive” in and of themselves (although that is true). No, on a more
strategic level what happens is that brands with total confidence push harder
in one direction, and don’t temper their execution, or hedge their bets. This
in turn generates  _difference_ ; growing the gap between them and their
competition and opening up market space.

Now, to an extent this might sound a bit like common sense. “Yeah, OK, brands
need a tight strategy, so what else is new?”. But actually I think there’s
something more profound going on here.

You see traditionally the main focus in the field of strategy has been
“smartness”, or “rightness”. You have smart strategies which succeed, and you
have stupid strategies which don’t. The way we judge a strategy is by how
“clever” it is, and the extent to which it “works” on a technical level –
almost like a formula.

By contrast what this alternative interpretation suggests is that the primary
deliverable of a strategy shouldn’t be smartness, or rightness, but in fact
_confidence_.

To put it bluntly:

**The main job of a strategy is to instil confidence in an organisation.**

Yes, naturally the strategy should be reasonably smart – or at the very least
not actively stupid. But if the confidence it instils is strong enough, the
thinking doesn’t need to be especially dazzling, since the true value
ultimately comes from a fearless authenticity, and aggressive execution.

I believe that the strategy industry’s misplaced focus on smartness rather
than confidence is to blame for why people in general don’t understand, like,
or buy it; and why most brands operate completely without it.

Just think about what strategy looks like if you have smartness as the core
value:

  * It becomes overly detailed and technical, as it seeks to cram more and more information and variables into its hypotheses
  * It becomes elitist and inaccessible as it starts to require a level of analytic sophistication that only a PHD can handle
  * It becomes vague and cautious in and of itself, as its commitment to cramming in multiple considerations begins to cut off options (you can always find a good reason not to do something)
  * It becomes boring and gutless because in a misplaced drive to behave “scientifically” it removes crucial subjective ingredients such as taste, intuition, and humour

**In short it becomes exactly what most of us understand as strategy today.**

By contrast when you place confidence as strategy’s primary deliverable, the
nature of the craft changes drastically:

  * It necessarily becomes far more simple and direct, since the strategy must be something which everyone can internalise and act upon without thinking about it, or having to consult some 200 slide deck
  * The language becomes not only less technical, but in fact  _deliberately_ casual and informal by design, since the goal is to maximise intuitive understanding across the largest number of people
  * Quirkiness and interestingness become crucial ingredients in the mix, since the recipient of the strategy is not simply some abstract notion like “the market”, but actual human beings, both inside and outside the organisation, and human beings care about that kind of stuff
  * Intelligence becomes balanced with more psychological notions such as motivation and inspiration, recognising that the effectiveness of the strategy is directly correlated with the intensity of the fire it lights in everyone’s bellies

**In short, strategy becomes a wildly different beast.**

I believe this is what founders, CEOs, and organisations at large are truly
lacking. Not intelligence, but confidence. When I think back on literally
every client I’ve ever had, and every company I’ve ever worked for, this truth
is hiding in plain sight. In every single case they weren’t  _quite_ sure of
themselves, of what they were about, and what direction they should take. They
were plenty smart enough to take sensible decisions that would keep the
business on track, and deliver growth. But they were always crouching behind
the shell of indecision I referred to earlier. There was never any true
conviction, and the full-blooded expression that comes with it which is the
common factor in all greatness.

Insight + simplicity + passion. That is what an effective confidence-oriented
strategy looks like.

So my challenge to you is to stop measuring your direction by how “right” you
think it is, and start to asking how much conviction it gives you. If the
answer is anything less than “100%, let’s get on it”, then one or more of
those ingredients is lacking. So dig a bit deeper, and when you’ve fixed it,
you’ll feel it in your bones.
