You know how they say “don’t talk about yourself, talk about your customer”?

Yeah well just for today I’m going to ignore that, and talk about me me me –
what I’m trying to do here, my vision for Basic Arts, and OK perhaps a little
bit about what that might mean for you.

Why am I doing this?

I don’t know really. Mainly to just organise my thoughts. Partly to put this
stuff out there so I’m held to account. And maybe also because I think some of
you will have an interesting POV on the matter – so if you do, please hit
reply and let me know.

Right, so what’s this about?

Well, for a while now I’ve been thinking about something I call “The Starbucks
Strategy”, which basically boils down to this:

  * Don’t raise the ceiling, raise the floor

I call it “Starbucks” because that’s exactly what they did. They didn’t
produce the best coffee. Instead they massively raised the standards of _bad_
coffee – turning the 3/10 norm into a 6/10. This is very different from what
most brands try to do. Most brands want to raise the ceiling. They want to
turn a 9/10 to a 10/10, and think that’s the way to create the biggest impact.
Because hey, the best must be the most impactful right?

Wrong.

The impact of turning the 3/10s into 6/10s is far _far_ more meaningful (and
lucrative) than creating the best of something. Starbucks have contributed
infinitely more positively to global coffee culture than your favourite
artisanal roaster, and that’s just a fact. (Even if that roaster considers
them a blight on the coffee landscape).

So what’s the relevance of this?

Well, that’s what I want to do with strategy. I want to create “The Starbucks
of Strategy”. I want to create a business that turns all the 3/10 strategies
out there (or let’s be real, they’re generally more like 0/10 cos they’re not
happening at all), into 6/10 ones.

I am probably not the best strategist. I am definitely not the most
experienced, or knowledgable. I have not advised the boards of Shell, or Meta,
or Lockheed Martin. And I probably never will.

But I am willing to venture that I _might_ be one of the best at “dumbing down
and sexing up” strategy concepts. Making them quick, accessible, and fun. And
that’s just what Starbucks did with real Italian coffee – introducing a “close
enough” version of it to the world, and massively raising the average
standards of coffee worldwide.

Just imagine for a second how impactful this might be at scale.

Strategic businesses create value. _New_ value. Unstrategic businesses don’t.
They either do something worthless, or they do something that’s been done many
many _many_ times before. What this means is that the amount of genuine value
being produced by the vast mass of companies out there is a _fraction_ of what
it should be based on their intelligence and efforts.

If however we were to make those masses _strategic_ – not necessarily
“Southwest Airlines strategic”, just reasonably strategic – then there would
be an explosion of new value, growth, and richness created for the _precise
same amount of effort and capital outlay_. (Or arguably even a little bit
less).

This is the potential power of successful implementing “the Starbucks of
Strategy”.

Now of course this probably sounds a bit grandiose. And who the hell am I
anyway, I’ve got a few thousand followers but it’s not like I’m Tony Robbins
or something.

But I do have a few ideas.

And regardless of the scale they achieve, it’s something to shoot for anyway.
It’s something to be getting on with. So I’ll give it a crack. And at the very
least hopefully produce a lot more value for you – my core crew – in the
process.
