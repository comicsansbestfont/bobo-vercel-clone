The other day a reader alerted me to a funny little scam being pulled,
surprisingly, by Apple. Apparently in the weeks running up to Christmas, they
have been known to book all cargo flights out of China, partially to allow for
rushes on their stock, but also to chuck a spanner in the works for their
competitors – ensuring they’re going to be the only story in town for that
time period.

To what extent this is really their intention I’m not sure, but it wouldn’t be
the first time Apple has been accused of ethically dubious practices. For
years they’ve taken jibes relating to everything from working conditions, to
environmental concerns, to tax; all the usual stuff you’d expect from a global
manufacturing megacorp.

You’d think that over the years this kind of consistent criticism would have
taken its toll on them in some appreciable fashion. But you know what?

**Nobody cares.**

Apple, despite having had far more bad press than your average enterprise,
continues to sit pretty not only as a tolerated brand, but a beloved one. No
doubt their critics – few as they are – often write their screeds on Apple
products, just as those who rail against sweatshop work regularly do so from
the comfort a pair of Nikes. This kind of mild hypocrisy is par for the
course.

_(NB I’m not sure if Nike actually do use sweatshops, but most people think
they do, so for the purposes of my article here they may as well)._

It’s strange, isn’t it, how in this age of so-called “ethical consumption”,
true ethical breaches are so often conveniently overlooked?

Well I’ve been thinking about this, and I’m going to go out on a limb here and
say that in reality there is  _no such thing_ as a widespread concern over
ethical consumption on the part of consumers today. What there is instead is a
concern about  _brand congruency_.

What do I mean by this?

In short people do not care whether a brand does something “good” or “bad” in
an objective sense. What they care about is whether a brand does something
_incongruent_ (or if you prefer  _inconsistent_), with their supposed
strategic offering.

Taking the Apple example for a moment, they never promised to be an ethical
company, or even a nice one. Sure, they have the usual reams of CSR
boilerplate, but that’s just ass-covering: it’s not a central part of what
they’re all about, or what they bring to the market. Because of this,
consumers will tolerate pretty much  _anything_ they do because hey, they’re
still holding up their end of the bargain. The same of course applies to Nike.
I have no doubt that Nike have also got loads of propaganda about ethical
working conditions and the like. And I’m sure they do a pretty good job with
it too. But the fact remains that they never promised to be an especially
ethical shoe company, so very few people take their ethical behaviour
seriously – for better or for worse.

**When a business has a clear, powerful strategic offering, that sets the
parameters of what it’s able to get away with.**

Of course you should strive for ethical behaviour for its own sake, that’s a
given. But the fact is that if you do something bad which is outside of the
scope of your offering, the market won’t punish you for it. And, furthermore,
if you do something  _good_ which is out of scope, it won’t reward you for it
either!

The only time ethical or unethical behaviour matters in a business sense, is
when it reinforces or erodes the offering. A good example of this can be seen
with the VW emissions scandal, where they were caught cheating emission
controls. Unlike the examples above, this did fly in the face of their
positioning, which they’d been bolstering for years with claims of
environmental friendliness and all the rest of it – and as a result they
suffered huge material and reputational losses.

This “rule of congruence”, as we might call it, clearly doesn’t only apply to
ethical missteps. Any “out of scope” behaviour is liable to be interpreted as
a broken promise, and will damage the brand, even if it’s harmless or benign.
Virgin has seen itself sink from being one of the world’s most beloved
companies – certainly up there with Apple and Nike – to being a slightly tacky
also-ran, in large part because of their mistake to license the Virgin name to
external operators, who of course didn’t use in quite the manner it’s suited
for.

Smart businesses get this – for example Amazon. They have their fingers in
many pies beyond their central shopping offering, but they are very careful to
ensure that these don’t infect or muddle with consumer perception. Most
notably their space program, Blue Origin, isn’t in any way obviously tied to
the parent company. Other brands wouldn’t do this; they’d just think “space is
cool, so if we tie it to our company we’ll be cool too!” – and so would just
call it Amazon Space or something. But Amazon know that this would be
incongruent, and so could cause them more harm than good.

Rounding off this idea then, I’ll leave you with the ultimate proof of the
concept, which is when bad press  _helps_ a company because it’s congruent.

My favourite example of this is United Airlines, who made truly horrible
headlines a few years back when they essentially assaulted a passenger on one
of their planes, dragging him off the aircraft due to overbooking (their own
error). You probably couldn’t get a more grim piece of PR if you tried, but
you know what happened? Sales went up.

For me the reason for this is obvious. People already saw United as a shitty
airline who do shitty things in order to be as cheap and efficient as
possible. This appalling customer service then was simply in keeping with
that. Sure, a little more extreme than you’d like to see on  _your_ flight.
But overall in line with something you expect to be efficient and moreover
_cheap_.

Of course, nobody thought “I want to fly on the abusive airline”. But United
did deepen their general no-frills status, and in practice that amounts to the
same thing.

So ultimately yeah, ethical behaviour doesn’t matter as much as most people
think. And it’s  _certainly_ not the commercial silver bullet that so many
brands seem to think it is.

But even so, let’s try to do it anyway.
