It’s time for another macro-trend piece.

As long time readers will know by now, these are my crude attempts to sketch
some of the more subtle forces shaping the world around us. As strategy is all
about adaptation to context, it follows that we must understand our context to
think strategically – and that’s what these pieces are all about.

_(Mostly however it’s a bit of fun and a chance for me to talk about something
other than brands for a change)_

The last two topics were [concentration](https://mailchi.mp/dd9af7538fb4/the-
problem-with-strategic-models-6462286) and [hyper normal
stimulus](https://us16.campaign-
archive.com/?u=dbfcfcd097fd0818275a2b8b8&id=da1736ac52). If you’ve not read
them then check them out. But otherwise let’s move onto today’s matter:

**The rise of horizontal loyalty.**

What is this?

Well first let’s think about loyalty. Mutual loyalty between a group of people
is probably the central force that determines the shape of a society. Indeed
we could probably define society just like that: _a group of people loyal to
each other_. For the most part this is what defines national boundaries.
Within X boundary there’s a group of people loyal to each other, and within Y
boundary there’s another group of people loyal to each other. Naturally when
the boundaries don’t neatly match the loyalties within them, that’s when
conflict arises.

Where do these loyalties come from? Well, that of course varies. They may be
religious, cultural, ethnic, or simply the reflection of a shared history and
a shared land. Forest people do things the forest way; plains people do things
the plains way. It doesn’t really matter: what matters is simply that such
loyalties exist, and that they are _particular_.

Nobody – _nobody_ – is loyal to everyone. Nobody takes a genuinely “one word”
perspective, despite the plentiful rhetoric to the contrary. We all have “our
people”, and therefore by definition we also have “not our people”. This is
only human, only natural, and there’s nothing wrong with it per se; it doesn’t
necessarily imply animosity. Our loyalties simply give us a shortcut with
which to smoothly engage with others, without having to establish trust from a
base of zero with every new person we meet.

And on top of this, they also give us a sense of home and belonging.

Now, as suggested above, human loyalties have traditionally been _place-
based_. They exist primarily between people who are from / live in a certain
location. Often they are multi-scale; strongest at the immediate local level,
and then getting weaker the wider you draw the circle around it. For our
purposes here however, we’ll talk about them in terms of nations, simply
because that’s a simple unit of “place” to discuss.

**This “place-based kinship” is vertical loyalty.**

The reason it’s “vertical” is because while it’s pinpointed in one spot, it
also moves “up and down” the social spectrum. In other words it binds people
of different classes together, provided they have that place in common. A Lord
and his butler, although miles apart in “rank” may still feel a sense of
brotherhood due to being from England, say.

This diagram illustrates what I mean:

Vertical loyalty is the oldest and most common form of loyalty in the world.
It’s the loyalty which, like I said, created the nation state, and with it
pretty much all legal, economic, and social systems we live by.

**So what’s horizontal loyalty?**

Well, at various points throughout history vertical loyalty has faced a
challenge. A typical example of this challenge can be found in the various
communist revolutions of the 20th century. These revolutions drew their lines
of loyalty not from _place_ , but from _class_. “Workers of the world unite”
is clearly a statement untethered from geography. It says it doesn’t matter
where you’re from, it just matters what class you are; that a worker from Peru
should feel more loyalty to a worker from China than they do to their middle
class neighbour down the street.

That’s horizontal loyalty, and on our diagram it looks something like this:

Now as both this image and history have shown us, the dilemma with horizontal
loyalty is that it can be quite bloody. That’s because it results in people
living side by side with others who have _conflicting loyalties_. Under
conditions of vertical loyalty, this doesn’t really happen; you’re basically
pals with everyone you’re likely to come into contact with. But when
horizontal loyalty is at play, that’s no longer true. Your neighbour could be
operating to a completely different set of values from you.

As a result horizontal loyalty is pretty unstable – and this instability
probably contributed to the eventual collapse of the USSR’s horizontal model
towards the end of the century.

Vertical loyalty went toe to toe with its challenger, and triumphed.

But that wasn’t the end of the story. There was another revolution just around
the corner. One ultimately far more powerful than anything Marx envisaged: the
internet.

As we discussed in the concentration piece, the internet’s central feature is
the _removal of boundaries_ , and the _dissolution of place_. Naturally then
we might expect this to have a corrosive effect on vertical loyalty, and so it
has proved, but in a way that the revolutionaries of the 20th century perhaps
wouldn’t have expected.

Instead of their vision of “workers of the world unite”, what we are now
seeing could be better described as “elites of the world unite”; a pretty
ironic reversal of fate.

In essence what we see today is a high degree of horizontal loyalty not at the
bottom of society, but at the top: where the values, opinions, and concerns of
the global upper classes (which I think would include everyone I’m talking to
here) have begun to converge, often in ways that decouple them from their
vertical place.

Here’s the diagram:

How this happened isn’t exactly rocket science. Those at the top of the socio-
economic ladder have the most access to the boundary-dissolving technologies
of the the connected world. This means they have greater means of finding each
other than the rest of the world. Couple this with the homogenising power of
big tech algorithms and you have a recipe for unification and consensus across
geographic lines.

There are naturally thousands of examples of this. A pretty obvious and benign
one can be found with TV. Whilst the global lower classes (speaking broadly)
continue to consume locally specific programming, the globally connected class
are now coalescing around “horizontal TV stations” such as Netflix. You and I
probably consume pretty much the same cultural diet even if I live in England
and you live in Brazil. However this may not be the same diet as our
neighbours down the street.

Less benignly of course none of us can fail to notice the political fallout of
this division. “Populism” we might say is basically a word used by the
horizontally integrated to describe the priorities of vertically integrated;
whilst “conspiracy theories” are how the vertically integrated interpret the
priorities of the horizontal.

We might even say that “political polarisation” isn’t really a policy conflict
at all; it’s instead a conflict between the models of vertical and horizontal
integration, just like the Cold War (with which of course it shares many
dynamic characteristics).

Anyway, plenty has been written about all that stuff, and it’s not my remit to
get into it here. What’s more interesting I think is following the thread of
horizontal integration a little bit further, to see where it may lead.

If we accept the idea that the internet encourages horizontal loyalties rather
than vertical, then it stands to reason that as it continues its march across
the globe more of these kinds of loyalties will emerge.

This isn’t a game that only the so-called “metropolitan elite” can play –
everyone can. Provided they have the technology of course, which increasingly
they do.

This may lead to a future looking something like this:

Understand of course that the reality would be far more complex than simply
the binding of the upper / middle / lower class. I use these terms only to
illustrate the principle. Horizontal loyalties _could_ organise like this,
sure. But they could also organise along the lines of religion, political
persuasion, cultural preferences, ethnic background, who knows.

However it happens, the key thing is people will no longer get their sense of
belonging in _place_ but in something untethered from place.

What would this mean? Well, who bloody knows, but clearly a hell of a lot.

For a trivial business thought, we may need to start thinking differently
about what constitutes a “market”. At the moment we draw these via
geographical boundaries. But will that be the right way of thinking in the
future? When you launch a business, will you be launching it to a “vertical
loyalty bubble” like the UK, or France, or India? Or will you be launching it
to a “horizontal loyalty bubble” of like minded people spread around the
world?

Even today I think it’s worth considering whether your company operates within
horizontal or vertical loyalties – but in the future this question may well be
standard.

Less trivially we will of course have to contend with the same dilemma as the
past revolution: the local intermingling of conflicting loyalties.

Indeed many people may even come to question the very legitimacy of structures
which are organised vertically in the first place. If you see your identity as
being unrelated to the land under your feet, then where does the authority of
that land’s legal, economic, and social system come from?

In the past it came from the consensus of a mutually loyal local populous. But
if such a thing ceases to exist, then what then?

But anyway, this is all just sci-fi speculation. The result, as always, will
be something far less crisp than such theorising suggests; but it’s intriguing
to think about nonetheless.

My purpose with this piece was simply to introduce you to the vertical /
horizontal lens of looking at the world, and hopefully I’ve done that.

I hope you find it somewhat useful – and not too scary.
