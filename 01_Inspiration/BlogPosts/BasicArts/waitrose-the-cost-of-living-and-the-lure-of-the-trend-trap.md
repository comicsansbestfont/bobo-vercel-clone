What are trends for?

In the minds of most businesses, trends are see as things to follow. They
represent the movement of the market in a certain direction, and thus to
follow the trend is to follow the money.

The formula is pretty basic:

**“X is starting to become more important to consumers, therefore if we offer
X we will increase our relevance and grow.”**

It’s logical, consumer-centric, and of course completely and utterly wrong.

The reason for this should be obvious to readers of this newsletter. All
strategically sound businesses have a fixed value offering, or if you prefer
“job” to do in the market, and in order to carve out market space and grow
brand equity they need to deliver on it consistently. If they go  _against_
their role by following a trend that isn’t aligned with it then not only will
they fail to capitalise on the trend – they’ll destroy their existing position
too.

For a case in point look no further than the recent troubles faced by
Waitrose, the UK’s “posh” supermarket.

For those who haven’t been following, the chain that was once beloved of the
aspiring middle classes has taken a beating both in its reputation and its
finances. Why? Because it committed the sin of trying to “keep up with
consumer needs”.

As you may have noticed, the UK and indeed much of the world has been
struggling with a “cost of living crisis” that has forced many consumers to
economise. At the same time, budget supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl have
continued to rise, as many punters (even middle class ones) have come to see
that they aren’t so bad after all.

**The trend narrative then has been clear: consumers are struggling to make
ends meet, and are seeking out cheaper options.**

So what is a brand like Waitrose to do?

Well, if they’re like any other trend-chasing market-share-obsessed
organisation, the answer is obvious: cut service, cut prices, and in doing so
“serve emerging consumer needs” and steal share from their budget competitors.
And of course this is just what they did – only it didn’t work out quite the
way they expected.

The problem lies in the fact that Waitrose’s market role – their  _destiny_
even – is to be the posh premium supermarket, whether they like it or not.
Regardless of “trends” they cannot change this. By chasing their budget / mid-
market competitors down the price rabbit hole they 1) fail to convince price-
sensitive shoppers to switch because hey, they’ve already got good options in
this space, and 2) they betray their core audience by damaging their once
fabulous product.

Waitrose are but one example of this trend-chasing error. In truth it befalls
almost every strategically mediocre business, especially those under pressure
to grow from shareholders, and the pattern is always the same:

  1. Grow by delivering value X
  2. Observe the growing popularity of value Y
  3. Chase growth by offering Y at the expense of X
  4. Ultimately fail to deliver either and suffer

**We might call this process the “trend trap”.**

So what lessons should we take from this? I think there are three.

**_LESSON 1 – YOU CANNOT CHANGE_**

This is one of the strategy truths that’s hardest for business to grasp, but
it’s key. You are what you are. You’re stuck. You cannot change. Your business
has been selected by the market to fulfil a certain role, and it has no
interest in you doing anything else, even if you want to.

For a business to switch strategy is like a frog deciding to become badger –
it’s futile because it’s simply not in its nature. It doesn’t correspond to
its component parts, nor the way that the ecosystem receives it. All it
succeeds in doing is becoming a shit frog and even shitter badger.

**_LESSON 2 – TRENDS ARE OVERHYPED AND NOT UNIVERSAL_**

In the grand scheme of things, even the mightiest trends are seriously
overblown. For the most part things don’t really change – or if they do they
change so slowly that businesses adapt to them organically and imperceptibly.
