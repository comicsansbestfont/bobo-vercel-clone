_Here we have part 6 of my cultural context series, in which I try to
illuminate some of the hidden forces that define the world in which we
strategise. Soon I’ll be able to piece these together into nice self-indulgent
little book! Until then, the others are here:_

“They don’t make ‘em like they used to”.

Yes, the refrain of nostalgic curmudgeonly luddites the world over. I should
know, I’m one of them. There are very few things that I don’t believe were
“better in the past”, which makes me a bit of a small-minded rube by most
people’s analysis these days. We live in a world which doesn’t only believe in
moving “forwards”, but couples that belief with an unshakable faith that
whilst we don’t know what the future holds, we can be certain it will be
“better”.

Now in one respect I agree that it is somewhat small-minded to reflexively
assume that everything in the past was superior to everything in the future –
but it seems to me equally small-minded to assume that everything in the
future will be superior to everything in the past. I once heard someone say
“people who accuse others of romanticising the past are simply those who think
it’s somehow more mature to romanticise the future”, and of course they’re
both wrong. Some things get better, and some get worse – that much should be
blatantly apparent with even a moment’s reflection.

What I want to talk about today however is something more subtle than the
question of whether things are getting “worse” or “better”. Instead I want to
talk about the phenomenon whereby  _things get worse because they get better_.
Or in other words:

**The crushing tedium of excellence.**

At its most raw level, the idea goes something like this: things are at their
best not when they are polished and optimised for maximal performance and
effectiveness, but rather when they arrive at a  _balance_ between the
effective and the ineffective; the smooth and the rough; the professional and
the amateur.

To give you a simple example, think about the output of Hollywood in the
1970s.

Cinephiles are for the most part in agreement that this decade was “peak
film”, bringing forth a deluge of masterpieces from The Godfather to Star Wars
to Jaws which have few comparisons before or since. This was the age of the
auteur, of excess, controversy, and glamour. And yet “good” as it apparently
was, it didn’t last. It seems we weren’t able, or weren’t willing, to continue
producing such a high level of artistry.

Why? Not because Hollywood got worse, but because it got  _better_.

As I understand it the accepted analysis for why 70s cinema was so good tends
to be that it was a moment in time when movie-making had been professionalised
and optimised – but crucially  _not too much_. For the first time they had
great equipment, the technology for pretty much any special effect they
fancied, and confluence of global talent into one geographical location, BUT
the industry was also still fundamentally chaotic. There was little business
sense, little accepted wisdom, little sophistication and little “science”.
Studios were basically happy to throw money at different filmmakers, give them
free rein, and hope for the best. This resulted in, yes, some of the greatest
movies of all time, but also some of the most damaging and spectacular
commercial flops – not to mention scandal, death, and outright criminality.

In time Hollywood managed to iron such kinks out of the system, and began to
make a far more polished and reliable product – both artistically and moreover
commercially. They started to realise what worked and what didn’t, and equally
realised that they didn’t have to tolerate alcoholic egomaniacal jackasses to
produce it. By and by this evolution brought us to the state we’re in today,
when Hollywood is “better than ever” on every  _objective_ metric you care to
mention, but also, on the  _subjective_ level, the level of our  _souls_ , is
absolutely shit. A formulaic meat grinder of maximally merchandisable pap.

This identical process has taken place in literally hundreds of industries,
always following the same pattern:

**Step 1 – amateurish (boring)**  
**Step 2 – amateurish / professional (thrilling)**  
**Step 3 – professional (boring)**

One example that’s very important to me is football, which I would suggest had
its “1970s Hollywood” moment in the late 90s and early 2000s. The game had
moved beyond the muddy, grey, hooligan infested gruel of the 70s and 80s, but
hadn’t yet reached the machine-like instrumentality of the 2010s and beyond.
Coaching was sophisticated, but not  _too_ sophisticated; there was still
space for the maverick, the hard man, and surprise package.

I was keenly reminded of this the other day when a young Manchester United
player, Anthony, was pilloried for doing an [outrageous piece of
showboating](https://youtube.com/shorts/dmmJnRegCM4?feature=share) in the
middle of a game. In the early 2000s pointless (and I would say  _joyous_)
moments of skill like this were fairly commonplace (Soccer AM Showboat
anyone?), but today they’ve largely been phased out, because hey, where’s
their  _utility_? Do they, in the final analysis, have an instrumental
purpose? If not then get rid of them – and stamp on any player who still has
enough mischief in his spirit to try.

Now look, of course there is subjectivity at play here. I realise that there
are plenty of people out there who would claim that, say, the 50s was the
golden age of cinema, or the 70s were the golden age of football. Who’s to say
that I’m not simply rationalising my own personal biases?

**Well that may be so – but even in the _objective_ analysis, the facts back
the theory up.**

For instance in America baseball fans would recognise what I’ve described at
the “Moneyball Effect”, the analytics revolution that changed the sport
completely a few years back. I won’t bore you with the details (largely
because I know very little about baseball), but sufficed to say it boiled down
to a bunch of maths making teams both  _far more effective_ and  _far more
boring_ at the same time. This had led (or, if you prefer, coincided) with a
collapse in the game’s popularity.

In basketball a similar collapse has occurred, in this case stemming from
teams suddenly realising that prioritising 3-point shots is a far more
effective (and dull) strategy than anything else.

In his great essay [ _What Moneyball-for-Everything Has Done to American
Culture_](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/10/sabermetrics-
analytics-ruined-baseball-sports-music-film/671924/) (which explains the
baseball and basketball examples, as well as touching on music and film),
Derek Thompson puts it beautifully when he says:

“The quantitative revolution in culture is a living creature that consumes
data and spits out homogeneity”.

Technology is making everything better and better until it breaks it. Until it
reaches a point where the objective argument for the superiority of the new
thing is unshakeable, and yet we all know in our subjective little hearts that
it is nonetheless crap.

And given that subjectivity is “just opinion” and that money in the bank is
the ultimate decision maker, who are we to argue?

My ultimate take here is that every system desperately needs inefficiencies.
It needs flaws. It needs texture. I suppose, ultimately, it needs  _humanity_.
Recently I have found myself starting to Google things by adding “reddit” to
the end of the search term, so it prioritises answers on the popular forum,
rather than the internet at large. Why? Because at least those answers are
real. At least they are human, unlike SEO optimised “perfect” answers which
are otherwise served up and consistently fail to satisfy. Reddit answers are
inconsistent, they’re not fact checked, and they’re not from a respected
source – and yet they are all the richer in spite of those “flaws”.

As creators, I think we have a responsibility to allow such flaws, flights of
fancy, and rough edges into our creations – not because this will make them
“work better” or “earn more money”, but precisely because they  _won’t_. Not
every single thing we do needs to amount to a formula with a dollar sign at
the end of it. Not everything needs to be instrumental. Not everything needs
to be rational. Sometimes things can simply be  _expressive_ , and serve other
parts of the psyche beyond the rigidly material.

For instance, when designing a brand, yes, you need to give due heed to what
“works”, that’s clear. Indeed you can (and should) give 90% heed to that
impulse. But also allow a bit of character into the mix. I was chatting with a
designer friend of mine the other day and asked him what is behind the
“blanding” trend of [all logos moving from serif to sans serif
font](https://twitter.com/BoF/status/1089388033428869120?s=20&t=IW1pUhKoWNfKs6TicNvwfw),
and he said it was because people believe that sans serif works better in
digital. Now I’m perfectly happy to accept this might be true, but it doesn’t
thus follow that “all logos should be sans serif”. This is what I’m talking
about. Sometimes you need to override what works in favour of what you just
bloody feel like.

I’ll leave you with a more sophisticated and poetic explanation from the
particle physicist Frank Wilczek, who Thompson references in his article. He
says that beauty benefits, yes, from symmetry – or what we might call for our
purposes here “optimisation” or “perfection”. But it also draws from what he
calls “exuberance” – a beautiful word that perfectly captures the point here.

“Looking up at the [interior of a
mosque](https://fineartamerica.com/featured/interior-of-shiekh-zayed-mosque-
naufal-mq.html) or a [cathedral](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/cologne-
cathedral-interior.html?sortBy=relevant), or gazing at a classic Picasso or
[Pollock](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Lavender-
mist.jpg) painting, you are seeing neither utter chaos nor a simple symmetry,
but rather a kind of synthesis; an artistic dizziness bounded within a sense
of order, which gives the whole work an appealing comprehensibility”.

Or in my way of looking at things: Eric Cantona may not be as good a
footballer as Kevin De Bruyne, but he’s a far far  _greater_ one. And in our
hearts, that’s what counts.
