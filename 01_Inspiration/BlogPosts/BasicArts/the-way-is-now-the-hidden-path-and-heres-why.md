First things first:

  * Yes, it’s still me, Alex from Basic Arts
  * And yes, this is still The Way, the strategy newsletter you subscribe to

…but a few things have changed.

Not only is the The Way now called The Hidden Path, but this is part of a
wider set of changes I’ve made to Basic Arts, culminating in a rebrand you can
check out [here](https://www.basicarts.org).

Essentially, I’ve taken my own medicine, and tried to take the next step in
the strategic evolution of my own business.

What does this mean for you?

Quite possibly nothing at all. The product is the same, and this newsletter
will continue to be the same, so you can stop reading here if you like.

However if you’d like to get a bit of an insight into why I’ve made these
changes, and the strategic challenges I’ve been grappling with myself, then
read on.

_(I’ve never quite understood why people are interested in seeing under the
hood of Basic Arts, but the last newsletter I wrote about it had my highest
open rate ever, so what do I know?)_

To begin, it’s important to flag that it’s near impossible to do this sort of
exercise to yourself – even if the exercise is your specialism.

It’s slow.  
Painful.  
And nothing like the process on a normal project.

But still, I did manage to dig out three key thoughts which informed the work,
and I’m hoping will push BA to the next level.

##  I. From B2B to P2P

My prior assumption was that my work involved one business (Basic Arts)
providing a service to another business (the client brand). Obviously this was
true, and continues to be so, and yet I’ve come to see that this may not be
the most fundamental relationship at play here.

You see, deeper than that, is the service being provided by me (Alex Smith) to
the individual client (the founder or CEO).

Of course, it is their business which is the _ultimate_ beneficiary of the
work – through growth, standout, enhanced profit, etc. – but these results
come _via_ the enhanced clarity and confidence of the founder. These are the
primary fruits of strategy development; the business results are secondary.

For that reason I have shifted my focus from “what my business can do for your
business”, and towards “what I can do for you”. From business-to-business
towards person-to-person. The product is identical, the goals are identical,
but the shift acknowledges the fact that this is deeply human work.

The practical consequences of this are:

  * A greater focus on the founder / CEO needs of clarity, confidence, and bravery
  * Bringing more of myself into the business, and ceasing to hide so much behind the “wall” of Basic Arts

##  II. Sweetening the strategy “pill”

As you know, I sell something (strategy) which most of my buyers don’t quite
understand.

It is that lack of understanding that creates the opportunity of course, and
opens up the need for it – but it still creates a great communication
challenge.

**The need is acute, but also unconscious.**

For this reason I have shifted idea for this newsletter away from “strategic
thinking”, and instead towards the idea of “competitive advantage by seeing
things others don’t” (hence The Hidden Path).

Understand, these are exactly the same thing.

Strategy is, _by definition_ , the act of gaining competitive advantage by
seeing things others don’t – but as a piece of language it doesn’t have quite
the same hook to it. So I am now going to try to ease people into the subject
of strategy via various more graspable entry points.

Whether or not that works, we shall see by the gross subscriber and follower
metrics…

## III. People like nice things

Look, this one is hardly complicated but I think it’s often neglected. There
are all sorts of “clever” reasons why someone would be interested in something
or buy something, but part of it is simply a question of:

  * Is it pleasurable to buy this thing?

Is it fun to buy it? Is it something I _want_ rather than something I merely
need?

The driving force for this is, largely, taste. It’s not subjective, it’s
objective, and is a hidden and [deeply underrated factor within business
success](https://basicarts.org/taste-the-secret-ingredient/), and one where I
felt I was falling short.

Of course you can judge for yourself whether I have improved my “shelf
appeal”, but I think considering the fact that I’m ultimately selling
“consultancy” (bleaugh) it’s in pretty good shape.

Anyway, I hope you were able to take something from that little bit of self
indulgence.

Thanks a lot for your continued support, back to our normal programming next
week.
