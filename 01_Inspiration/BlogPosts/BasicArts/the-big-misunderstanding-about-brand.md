Whatever most people believe about a subject, you can be sure that the _exact
opposite_ is true.

It’s crazy how often this principle turns out to be accurate. I’d almost call
it a law of nature. Or “Smith’s Law” perhaps. On any subject of
_understanding_ (as opposed to hard fact), people have an incredible ability
to get precisely the wrong end of the stick. So much so that you can get a
great insight into the world simply by assuming this to be the case by
default.

_(There’s a great Seinfeld episode about this – isn’t there always? – where
George decides to do the exact opposite of what he thinks he should do in any
given moment, an approach which naturally yields great success)._

Our case in point today is the idea of “brand”.

Like everything else, it’s something which most people have totally backwards
– including many marketers and brand experts.

Let me show you.

Here’s the common understanding of what brand is, how it works, and what you
use it for:

• You create a company  
• You have a product or service to sell  
• You create a “brand” to overlay on top of the product or service  
• And the brand helps you sell it

Seems pretty sensible right? People build brands to help them sell product. If
you have a great brand – like Apple, BMW, Coke, etc. – then you’ll shift more
units than if you have a crap brand. Thus it makes sense to do a “branding”
exercise to try and make your business as appealing as possible.

Like with all misunderstandings, there is some truth here.

Doing things like this – using a brand to help sell product – does work. It
works well enough in fact to furnish the entire multi-billion dollar
“branding” industry. And those guys aren’t wasting their time; they are
providing value.

But, passable though it may be, this understanding of brand is still _wrong_.

The truth can be summed up in the following couplet:

**It’s not your brand’s job to sell your product.**  
**It’s your product’s job to sell your brand.**

Let me repeat that.

**It’s not your brand’s job to sell your product.**  
**It’s your product’s job to sell your brand.**

These are two entirely different ways of playing the game, where the order is
flipped. In the first approach, the conventional approach, you start with a
product and then you “brand it”:

**Product — > Brand**

In the second more strategic approach you start with brand, and then you
manifest it in product:

**Brand — > Product**

If you see brand as being this vague stylistic thing represented by nice
design and pretty words this idea probably doesn’t make a lot of sense. You
can’t just make a cool logo and then pull a successful product out of it.

But if you understand brand correctly, _as an expression of value_ , and you
understand product correctly, _as a manifestation of value_ , then it starts
to make sense.

**Brand = expression of value**  
**Product = manifestation of value**

To give you an example of what I mean, let’s think about that old chestnut
Patagonia (sorry to always use the same examples but it just makes it easier
for everybody to click into the concept quickly).

Do they make a jacket, and then start doing brand stuff to “elevate” it and
make it seem “special”?

No, they do the opposite. They start with a super clear idea of their brand –
its value, its meaning, its philosophy – and then engineer the jacket to be as
vibrant an expression of those things as possible. The brand “made flesh” if
you like. And of course with this thinking they don’t have to stop at jackets.
They aren’t a “jacket company” with cool branding. No, they can make
_absolutely anything_ which acts as a physical manifestation of the brand –
e.g. their branching into “provisions”, and workwear, and all this other
random stuff which you don’t see from their nominal “competitors” like
Berghaus or whoever.

Most businesses don’t start with brand like this, they end with it, like the
cherry on the cake.

And this is why they:

• Struggle to differentiate  
• Don’t have a clear idea of what verticals they can move into  
• Make uninspiring products  
• And generally have shit brand presence

It’s because of all this that the very term “branding” is fatally flawed. If
you are “branding” something then you’ve _already lost_ , because that implies
that the thing itself didn’t emerge _from_ a fully formed brand. In other
words it didn’t emerge from a rich, opinionated, insightful expression of
genuine value. It’s just a generic “thing”.

You need to stop thinking of your branding as a sort of “advertisement” for
your product, and start thinking of the _product as the ad_.

You are selling an _idea_.  
Selling a point of view.  
Selling a belief.  
Selling a philosophy.  
Selling a vision.

The product is a form of advertisement for _those things_. An agent for them.
A messenger.

“OK”, you might be thinking, “I get that this is true for something sexy and
aspirational like a fashion brand, but isn’t this all a bit over the top for a
more functional business?”.

No.

This misconception comes from the other fallacy that assumes that “branding”
is by definition high falutin’ and glamorous. But of course brand is not those
things. It is just a pointed and insightful expression of value.

Pimlico Plumbers, the London plumbing, heating, and electrics titans, built a
brutally effective (and unglamorous) business “brand first” – by starting with
the platform of getting people’s problems fixed _immediately_ , without any
complexity or messing around.

Sounds obvious but there’s a lot of depth there. They recognised that when
your boiler breaks, or your pipes burst, you just want it dealt with – and
therefore are probably willing to pay massively over the odds to do that. Thus
you get 24 hour service, instant phone answering, 1 hour call-out times, and
yes, breathtakingly extortionate prices.

But that’s cool because _that’s a brand_. Just as much as Patagonia is. They
are not a plumbing company who have done a good “branding job” (in fact
they’ve clearly done remarkably little in that regard). They are a brand idea
who have manifested as a plumbing company – and much more besides.

So flip your thinking.

Bring your idea of brand to being the deepest, most foundational part of your
business. The soil from which the rest of it grows. And then nurture all else
you create in its image.

Of course, if you haven’t been thinking this way so far, then your current
brand won’t be up to this task. And that’s a great test in itself. Can you
grow a business from your brand? Probably not.

So there is work to be done.
