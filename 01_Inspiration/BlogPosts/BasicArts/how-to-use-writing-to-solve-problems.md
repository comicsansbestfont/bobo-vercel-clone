I have written before that if you want to have a successful newsletter, you’d
better be happy with firing off 500 mails to absolutely nobody – because in
order to get there, that’s exactly where you’ll have to start.

Fortunately, things haven’t been _quite_ that bad in my case; I’m a long way
from 500 mails and have scraped together more than zero subscribers. Even so,
the fact remains that I have had to do a lot of writing without many people
reading it – and on the face of it that’s a pretty dismal chore.

**However, much as I want this newsletter to grow, being read is not my
primary goal when I write: problem-solving is.**

Many of my mails are, in effect, private exercises in which I figure out
something relevant to a project I’m grappling with. The fact I’m able to
repurpose them for the consumption of other people is great, but even if I
couldn’t it would still be worthwhile.

When you write about something in a long-form narrative style (not mere bullet
points or notes), two things occur:

**1 – You order, validate, and strengthen your _existing_ thinking**  
**2 – You generate _new_ thinking and solutions**

I’m doing it right now. This binary breakdown I just wrote here I hadn’t
really figured out until a moment ago. All I knew was that I wanted to write
about writing for problem-solving and that in the process of doing so I would
need to make my views on the matter clear and helpful. As a result, out popped
these two benefits, which act as their own proof; both clarification of my
thinking, as well as new ideas in and of themselves.

Although I think both of these effects can occur at the same time, for the
sake of simplicity let’s address them one by one.

The first – writing to order your thinking – is a technique that is used
extensively in Amazon. Amazon is a brand that I haven’t written much about
since there’s not much you can learn from their [strategic
thinking](https://basicarts.org/newsletter/) (unlimited cash to throw loads of
shit at the wall and see what sticks is not easily replicable) – but from a
_managerial_ perspective, they are pretty much the best there is.

One of their core techniques is the use of written memos rather than
presentations. Where other companies would typically build their meetings
around PowerPoint decks, Amazon insists on the “presenter” writing their idea
in narrative prose. The first 15 minutes of the meeting then consists simply
of everyone sitting and reading in silence and only then entering into the
discussion when the whole thing is digested.

As Bezos himself says:

“The reason writing a 4-page memo is harder than “writing” a 20-page
PowerPoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better
thought and better understanding of what’s more important than what, and how
things are related.”

In other words, you can’t hide faulty reasoning in an essay. A bad PowerPoint
is still somehow passable, but a bad piece of writing is just bad. It doesn’t
stack up. It has holes. It can’t rely on the audience to fill in the blanks.
Long-form writing demands _completeness_ — and as such encourages completeness
in its subject.

When I present strategies back to clients, I will confess that I generally
start with a deck. It allows for a bit more showmanship, and that’s important
in my game. However following acceptance of the initial draft, I then like to
transfer the strategy on a couple of pages of A4, and use that as the root
document going forward (for reference, briefing, sharing etc.). Through this
process, I feel something is always added to the idea. It always becomes
stronger, simpler, because it has nowhere to hide and so loses its fluffy
edges.

Bearing this in mind, in a purely internal business context – where there’s
less need for showmanship – why not jump straight to this point? I’m confident
you would see a marked improvement in quality of thought. Some might protest
that they aren’t “good writers”, but we aren’t trying to get published by _The
New Yorker_ here. We are only putting across the information. And information
is the precursor to action, and therefore unavoidable. Whether you write or
not, you are still processing it – so why not do it well?

As for using writing to generate _new_ thinking and solutions, this is
typically a much more private exercise.

I’m not sure it would work for everyone, but I’ll tell you what works for me.
When you have a problem to solve, simply take a pad of paper, and begin
writing a stream of consciousness on it without stopping; a “conversation with
yourself” if you like. You’re not trying to impress anyone, you’re not going
to show it to anyone, the value is simply in forcing yourself to continue
getting words down on paper, and as a result, dredging up new angles and new
ways of looking at the problem.

I’ve found on occasion that this exercise can achieve in 20 minutes what might
otherwise be a couple of days of work.

In sum, I think we have all been taught to have a weird and distorted view of
what writing is. Thanks to its educational ghettoisation into subjects like
English literature, history, and philosophy, we see it as something artistic
or academic. To be a “writer” is to be someone somehow detached from reality.
And to “write” is to do something decadent or fancy or difficult. But writing
doesn’t have to be any of those things. At its deepest level, it is the same
as _speech_ : thought made manifest. In fact, it’s deeper still; it is
_editable_ thought, which can be captured in time, and disseminated on an
infinite scale.

So whether you have an audience of one million, one thousand, or zero, its
utility remains much the same – clear creative thinking. If this matters to
you, then you’re crazy not to.
