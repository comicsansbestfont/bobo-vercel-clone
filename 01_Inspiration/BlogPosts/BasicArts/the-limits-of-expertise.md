“People are sick of experts.” These infamous and much-derided words uttered by
UK Conservative parliamentarian Michael Gove express a sentiment with which we
are now probably all familiar. It has come to represent a sign of the
times—either an indictment or a celebration (depending on one’s political
point of view) of our current age.

Certainly, the disdain for expertise and its promised consequences have been
highly alarming for many people. They are woven through various controversial
and destabilising phenomena from Trump, to Brexit, to fake news, to the
generally ‘anti-elitist’ tone that characterises populist politics and much
contemporary discourse. And this attitude stands in stark contrast to the
unspoken but assumed Obama-era doctrine of “let the experts figure it out”; an
idea that had a palpable End of History feeling about it, and that makes this
abrupt reversion to ignorance all the more startling.

The majority of educated people are fairly unequivocal in their belief that
this rebound is a bad thing, and as such many influential voices have been
doing their best to restore the value of expertise to our society. The
nobility of this ambition is quite obvious. Why on earth would we not want to
take decisions informed by the most qualified opinions? However, it is within
this obviousness that the danger lies.

I want to propose that high expertise, whilst generally beneficial, also has
the capacity in certain circumstances to be pathological as well—and that if
we don’t recognise this and correct for it, then we will continue down our
current path of drowning its benefits with its problems. In short, if you want
to profit from expertise, you must tame it first.

To draw a line between when high expertise helps and when it potentially
hinders, we first need to acknowledge that this anti-elitist trend did not
emerge from nothing. ‘Experts’ as a group (if such a thing can be held to
exist) have not exactly covered themselves in glory in the last few years, so
the cynicism they now face is to some degree justifiable.

We need not get into the weeds here about the specific issues. But, suffice it
to say, the complex manoeuvring of some extremely bright and learned people
unwittingly triggered the financial crisis. Apocalyptic deadlines for climate
change devastation came and went without fireworks. Election predictions on
both sides of the Atlantic have been appalling, as have the predictions on the
immediate consequences of those elections. Silicon Valley ‘geniuses’ plunge
from one self- inflicted crisis to another. And, meanwhile, we have watched as
what many people consider lunacy leaks out of the credentialed halls of
academia and into the world at large.

In other words, smart people keep getting it wrong and scepticism about their
competence has grown as a result. This seems to be a fairly straightforward
story at first glance, and yet the public will only take their antipathy so
far. Nobody says, “I want someone unqualified to be my president, therefore I
also want someone unqualified to be my surgeon.” Nobody doubts the value of
the expertise of an engineer or a pilot. This apparent inconsistency is what
frustrates the anti-anti-elitists so much, not least because it seems to be
unjustifiable.

However, it is worth drawing a distinction between these two types of
expertise—the kind people question, and the kind people don’t. In short,
people value expertise in closed systems, but are distrustful of expertise in
open systems. A typical example of a closed system would be a car engine or a
knee joint. These are semi-complex systems with ‘walls’—that is to say, they
are self-contained and are relatively incubated from the chaos of the outside
world. As such, human beings are generally capable of wrapping their heads
around the possible variables within them, and can therefore control them to a
largely predictable degree. Engineers, surgeons, pilots, all these kinds of
‘trusted’ experts operate in closed systems.

Open systems, on the other hand, are those that are ‘exposed to the elements,’
so to speak. They have no walls and are therefore essentially chaotic, with
far more variables than any person could ever hope to grasp. The economy is an
open system. So is climate. So are politics. No matter how much you know about
these things, there is not only always more to know, but there is also an
utterly unpredictable slide towards chaos as these things interact.

The erosion of trust in expertise has arisen exclusively from experts in open
systems mistakenly believing that they know enough to either predict those
systems or—worse—control them. This is an almost perfect definition of hubris,
an idea as old as consciousness itself. Man cannot control nature, and open
systems are by definition natural systems. No master of open systems has ever
succeeded—they have only failed less catastrophically than their counterparts.

Every king, queen, pharaoh, emperor, president, prime minister, and dictator-
for-life in history has tried to master statecraft, and every one of them has
failed. If they had not, their formula would have calcified into knowledge and
rumbled on successfully indefinitely. And wasn’t such a legacy the goal of
every single one of them? The better ones only failed more gradually, less
bloodily, than the rest. But slowly their ideas, too, unravelled in the face
of chaos. Ultimately, history has shown this to be axiomatic: the more you
seek to control nature, to control an open system, the more disastrous the
results.

Knowing this, it’s a wonder that humility in the face of open systems is still
such a rare commodity amongst those who know them. Perhaps it’s because the
Enlightenment granted us so much mastery over closed systems that we forgot
the distinction existed. One could argue that we have earned our arrogance
when it comes to technological progress, for instance. But just because we
invented smartphones, it does not follow that we can predict the future.

So what are we to do? The anti-elitist solution is to simply disregard the
opinions of any expert in an open system. Given that accurate prediction or
control are impossible, we might as well rely upon the layman’s word as on any
other. Who cares what the so-called experts say? This would be the wrong
conclusion to draw. Laymen can have big opinions too, which are likely to be
even more erratic.

Instead, we must continually encourage the interplay of diverse expert voices
to help ease us into the future gradually, without any one of them gaining
absolute authority. This variety is important, since all open systems, being
fundamentally unknowable, are governed by competing theories as to how they
work. There are no competing theories for being an auto-mechanic, or for
flying an aeroplane. There is just one way to do those things.

But when it comes to open systems, multiple interpretations apply. In
economics, for instance, you have Marxists, Keynsians, Hayekians, and so on.
All are ‘experts,’ and yet they may hold completely opposing views on any
given topic of economic debate. It is only the interplay of such opposing
views, stretched over time, that mitigates the chaos of the open system. It
enables society to be agile and reactive. It prevents us from ever trying to
sculpt the future, and thereby fends off the disasters that inevitably occur
if only one voice is allowed to become hegemonic. It is this that has shaped
the society in which we live today—nobody designed it; we merely stumbled here
in the dark, getting this far by avoiding terminal catastrophe with a
combination of deliberation and good fortune.

Herein lies the beauty of democracy, and indeed all bipolar, yin-and-yang
systems. Democracy doesn’t work because it gives people what they want—it
works because it gives nobody what they want. And, as a result, nobody is ever
able to fall victim to their belief that they control open systems. The
troubles of experts in recent times can be interpreted as a continuation of
this balancing act—provided that they are not usurped altogether.

For expertise to function properly and flourish it needs to be bound in the
following three ways:

First, an expert or observer must always consider whether the recommendations
pertain to an open or closed system. This line won’t always be perfectly drawn
(medicine is a good example of a semi-open system), but it can be
approximated. This will determine the appropriate level of scepticism.

Second, experts who realise they are operating in open systems must be
vigilant to adopt a certain level of humility. No grand theory works; it only
fails less spectacularly. This should hedge predictions being made in
unhelpfully absolutist terms.

And third, we should always encourage the interplay between diverse viewpoints
in open systems—for only such an interplay can pull us back from the
inevitable excesses of hubris, that attract us like moths to a flame.
