Difference, as we know, is at the heart of strategy.

In any realm – business, politics, military, personal – it is about walking a
different path to the others around you. Indeed we might say that’s its very
definition:

#### **Strategy is that which only you do.**

Naturally, you will be the same as others in the vast majority of ways – 95%
of your actions are probably completely standard. But the remaining 5% is
where you get leverage, where you find your edge. That’s your strategy.

Still, whilst difference from others is fundamental to the [strategic
process](https://basicarts.org/newsletter/), it’s not the only difference that
counts. In fact, there is another form of difference which I would say is even
more important, and that is this:

#### **Difference from yourself.**

This sounds a bit esoteric, but actually, it’s very simple. You see the
problem with most strategies is that it’s kind of bullshit: all high-minded
talk, but very little in the way of real tangible action. Many are strategies
that only exist on paper, and not in the real world. Many are the
organisations and people who believe they are following a strategy, but in
reality, are following the same generic path as everyone else.

The way to escape from this trap is to not only measure your difference from
others _but to measure your difference from yourself before you adopted the
strategy_.

In other words, what have you changed as a result of this strategy?

The reason this is important is that you can kid yourself on the first point,
but not on the second. For example, if a business adopts a new wooly strategy
that actually means nothing meaningful, and is asked to defend it in relation
to their competitors, they can generally do a pretty good job. It’s super easy
to rationalise a shit strategy and explain in convoluted terms how it works.
What isn’t so easy to rationalise however is the far more simple question:
“what have you changed?”.

Naturally, if a strategy hasn’t prompted an obvious binary change in
comparison to conditions pre-strategy, then it doesn’t exist. All you’ve done
is intellectualise what you were doing before – something which feels good but
is otherwise pretty pointless.

If you don’t have much experience with [developing
strategy](https://basicarts.org/) you may doubt the extent to which this is
possible, but trust me, it’s not only possible; it’s the norm.

I’ve worked in organisations who have done big strategic exercises, changed
absolutely nothing of consequence, and yet _truly_ believed they were
following through on their plans. Equally, at the start of my doing this line
of work, I worked with a couple of clients who wholeheartedly agreed with my
strategic recommendations, but then (to my mind) did nothing about it. Again,
they _thought_ they adopted the strategy but they hadn’t, not really.

I now see that measuring the difference between yourself _today_ and yourself
_yesterday_ is the one sure-fire way you can avoid this trap. It’s simple,
it’s binary, and there’s no hiding.

What makes it even more important than the difference you have with
competitors is that without _it there is no strategy_. A slightly dodgy
strategy that _exists_ is generally preferable to a brilliant one that
doesn’t. It’s like if you want to lose weight: it’s more important that you
change your behaviour than the specifics of the behaviour you change to.
(_Within reason of course – if your strategy is to double your cake intake
then OK, you’re probably better off with nothing…_).
