There are two ways brands can be created – by giving or taking.

Most people imagine the giving kind; where the business wants to offer
something new to the world, or make something better. They see a need that
isn’t being met, and serve it, leaving the world richer for their presence.
Without them, something would be lacking.

This might be the stereotype, but it is by no means the norm. Far more common
are businesses built through the taking paradigm. In this model, the founders
observe an emerging trend or growing category, and decide to grab a piece of
the pie. Cider consumption is growing? Then we’ll make a cider too. People
love gourmet burgers? Let’s add that to our portfolio. This parasitic approach
works by diluting the market that giving brands created, sucking it dry before
moving onto the next thing.

Superficially you might look at those two models and assume that, whilst it’s
more difficult, the giving approach is more effective. However, you’d be
wrong. Being a parasite works. All the world’s most powerful groups, from
Unilever to InBev to P&G, use this as their primary new product development
strategy. They wait until there’s momentum in a particular space, and then
step in using their huge marketing budgets and superior retailer clout to blow
the original innovators out of the water. Sometimes the big brand groups may
just buy up the smaller giving brands, but this can be even worse, as the
groups then lock the pioneers into particular commercial roles that shift
their focus away from consumers and innovation.

Either way, the moneyed parasites suppress creativity and slow the development
of markets, leaving the wider world poorer for it.

But things might be changing.

A study last year uncovered something rather surprising. Of the 100 biggest
advertisers in FMCG in the United States, [90% of them lost market
share](https://www.catalina.com/news/press-releases/catalina-mid-year-

"90% lost market share") in 2015. The same was true for

advertisers in automotive](http://adage.com/datacenter/ "automotive").
Assuming this trend more or less held across all categories, we are faced with
the intriguing paradox that advertising spend appears to lose market share.

How can this be?

We can rule out the idea that advertising is damaging in and of itself. If you
can afford it, go for it. The more people who know about you the better. We
need to look one layer deeper than that, at the type of brand that leans on
advertising as a marketing strategy, and thus occupies those big-spending
spaces.

What we find there are parasitic brands; brands offering generic products that
face huge amounts of competition, and thus have to strain for raw brand
awareness just to keep their heads above water. The approach that papered over
the flaws of their substandard businesses for the last 50-years is beginning
to crack.

The reason, as ever, is the internet. The sheer volume of sources through
which we learn about brands has exploded since advertising’s heyday, and this
means that controlling the paid-media airwaves buys you a much smaller share
of voice than ever before. This has allowed more niche, creative, giving
brands to gain traction without big budgets. That’s where the market share is
going – not to a major competitor the way it might have in the past; instead
it’s dissolving across dozens of micro-competitors, with each catering to
specific pockets of consumers in interesting ways.

So how can we use these trends to our advantage, even big brands?

The crucial skill is controlling the content of independent media. Think about
it: every day brands are discussed, but in the vast majority of cases the
brand in question is not a participant. So you have to ask whether these
discussions are serving a marketing purpose. When a random bloke on the street
mentions your brand to his mate, is he communicating your message? If the
answer is ‘yes’, you start to wriggle out of the bondage of advertising spend.

The secret is simple. Your business must be its own ad. All the ingredients
that make a great campaign, implant them into your business.

First, you need a clear message. Something as pure as Red Bull’s ‘Wings’, or
Patagonia’s ‘cause no unnecessary harm’, or Airbnb’s ‘Belong Anywhere’. Most
brands don’t have this, instead, flitting from one thing to another with each
budget cycle.

Then you need a piece of creative to deliver it. But the canvas for that
creative must be the fabric of the company, not a piece of media. Think about
the free lifetime repairs of Patagonia, or the diverse techniques Airbnb uses
to help people get under the skin of a place. Build these things with clarity,
creativity and utility, and your message will shine perpetually.

It’s more or less impossible to talk about these brands reinforcing their
messages, because they’re so intertwined with the company. For traditional
brands – Coke, Tesco, Ford, et al – the same thing isn’t true because they
only apply this thinking to their ads, leaving their most important marketing
asset – the business itself – muddled and generic.

The marketing battlefield of the future isn’t media, it’s business operations.
Do this well, and you can’t help but be giving.
