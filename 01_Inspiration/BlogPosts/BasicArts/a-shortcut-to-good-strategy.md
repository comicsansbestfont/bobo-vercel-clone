It has been said that the true competitor of a Harley Davidson is not a
Yamaha, or a Honda, but in fact a conservatory. Within this quip lies the most
fundamental of strategic truths; one which vanishingly few businesses
acknowledge or understand:

_Your true category is probably not defined by products similar to yours._

Naturally, we could say that Harley Davidson exists in the “motorbike
category”, and with a one-dimensional reading of the situation, they certainly
do. But that fact does not give us an accurate picture of market dynamics or
buyer thought process. The majority of Harley’s sales do not come via the
punter performing a textbook competitive analysis, for instance:

  1. Deciding they want a motorbike
  2. Looking at the different models, weighing up the pros and cons of each
  3. Making a purchase decision based on which matches their needs best

No, more likely (in their particular case) is that someone simply wants a
Harley, but has to decide whether it’s a realistic / responsible decision in
their current life circumstances. In other words, whether those savings are
going on a Harley or a conservatory.

This understanding naturally has a profound impact on the strategic thinking
that Harley uses to run their business. If they saw themselves as simply being
part of the “motorbike category”, they would naturally give a lot more
attention to matching or topping the offerings of competitor marques – thus
gradually becoming more and more like them. But as they don’t see themselves
like that, they are free to go in a more distinctive direction – one which
makes them, for many, an automatic choice.

Such sophisticated “true category” understanding and [strategic
thinking](https://basicarts.org/newsletter/) would be transformative to the
majority of brands, but very few ever look beyond the set of businesses
_superficially_ similar to their own.

Nowhere is this one-dimensional thinking more rampant than in the FMCG/CPG
categories. Such brands face a structural disadvantage on this front, as their
sales figures are provided by grocery chains within their “listed categories”:
for instance “juice” or “biscuits” or “soap”. This naturally brackets their
thinking, and thus encourages a competitive dogfight for hallowed “market
share” within that niche.

Rarely do they realise that true strategic advantage can be gained by
bracketing themselves with products from _outside of their category_ –
products with which they are _genuinely_ competitive in the real world.

Take for instance bananas. Bananas, superficially, belong in the category of
“fruit” along with say apples, oranges, and mangoes. If bananas were a brand,
that’s who they’d be measured against, and from whom they’d be expected to
“steal” market share. But how often do people weigh up the purchase of a
banana versus a mango? One is an ideal on-the-go product, whilst the other is
palpably not. It’s quite hard to see them as interchangeable, even if they are
both fruits. And then what about other _non-fruit products_ which many people
substitute with bananas? For some, bananas – with their handy “packaging” and
“indulgent” taste – are essentially a confectionary substitute. For others,
with their energy-giving properties, they are a breakfast or pre/post-workout
food. Thus bananas actually exist in a variety of categories simultaneously
and have as their “competitors” not only mangoes, but also Mars bars,
Lucozade, Nutri-Grain, bowls of porridge, and bags of nuts.

“Brand banana” would do well to acknowledge this, and not let themselves be
seduced by what happens to be going on in the “fruit” category at any given
moment.

For myself, I can readily recall two CPG clients whose strategy was explicitly
built on re-interpreting their category. In each case, the brands had a
superficial “primary category” (i.e. the collection of products that look like
them), and a true “secondary category” (i.e. the products that do a similar
job to them, but which are superficially different). By shifting attention to
the secondary category, they were able to command an immediate competitive
advantage due to their profound differences in that alien space (i.e. consider
how a banana is bigger, cheaper, and more natural than, say, a Nutri-Grain
bar; this is a more effective competitor than whoever Nutri-Grain’s supposed
competitor is).

It’s a staggeringly simple device, but one that will remain invisible to most
businesses due to the way financial figures are reported. I think it’s a
little coincidence that these two clients I have in mind were the two fastest-
growing CPG brands in the UK in 2018.

So, the takeaway is simple – can you identify a “secondary category” of your
own? Not all businesses will have one (toilet paper is, let’s face it,
probably toilet paper), but the majority will. If identified correctly, you
will probably find yourself in a territory where your strategic thinking now
has a far clearer path to growth than in your primary category – and immediate
ideas on how to make that happen.
