If I was going to recommend just one piece of research to my clients – or
indeed any business – without hesitation, it would be this:

_Find out who buys your product._

It’s a fairly common theme for research, but even so, I’ve found that
surprisingly few brands have a good handle on it. Pretty much all have a good
idea of who they _want_ to buy their product, or who they _think_ is buying
their product, but very few actually know who _truly is_ buying their product.

Why this is I do not know. Cost I suppose. It feels kind of wasteful to spend
money researching people who you’ve already “captured”. But perhaps a
secondary disincentive is fear; fear that you won’t like what you find.

This fear is well-founded, since I’ve found that almost invariably the true
nature of a brand’s consumer base is very different from their idealised
conception of it. It is always less educated, less trendy, less youthful,
lower status, and generally all-around less “aspirational” than the brand
would like it to be. People tend to think they’re serving Michelle Obama when
they’re actually serving Homer Simpson, and they find this pretty depressing
when they figure this out.

I however don’t find this depressing. In fact, I think it’s fairly liberating.

**What it means is that targeting is much less meaningful than we imagine it
to be.**

We do not need to appeal explicitly to a certain group in order to get the
brand positioning right with that group. In fact, we can do the opposite: we
can target ourselves at tiny slivers of the population safe in the knowledge
that it will not restrict our sales accordingly.

**This is important, because the narrower the target, the more distinctive the
brand.**

Broadly targeted brands – at pains to show that they are “for everyone” – are
dull; and consequently appeal strongly to no-one. However narrowly targeted
brands – because they can be something _particular_ – are vibrant and
characterful; and thus attract a broad pool of people due to their outsized
market presence.

This is what I all “**the targeting paradox** ”:

_The narrower your target market, the broader your overall appeal._

A classic example of the targeting paradox in action is the Marlboro Man.
Aside from the obvious fact that cigarette brands can’t advertise anymore, I
find it unlikely that such ad creative would ever get commissioned today,
purely due to its supposed lack of inclusiveness. It is after all, extremely
macho; and thus would seemingly alienate not only all women, but a good chunk
of men too. Needless to say however this isn’t what happened – the Marlboro
Man is credited, explicitly, with making that brand the number 1 cigarette
with women. Crazy right? It’s as if people are actually happy to buy a product
which doesn’t precisely mirror themselves.

A modern equivalent of this same dynamic can be found with the anecdote I’ve
mentioned before about Grenade – the most childishly masculine brand in UK
grocery – selling to an equal split of men and women.

Quite why we should be surprised by this I do not know. I mean, nobody is
stupid enough to think that expensive diving watches are only bought by deep-
sea divers – so why do they think that such blunt logic applies to more
everyday brands?

Of course, marketers have long understood the idea of “aspiration”; of selling
to the person someone would like to be as opposed to who they are. But in
truth, it goes wider than that. People are generally more than happy to buy
products made neither for the person they are nor the person they wish they
could be. Distinctive and memorable brand positioning tends to do the trick,
especially in categories you don’t think too much about.

So that’s the bottom line this week. By narrowing your target you enable
yourself to take ever more strong and distinctive positions. This equates to
clarity, cut through, and above all else charisma – something that moves
people far more powerfully than the illusion that the brand was made for them.

I hope it goes without saying that I don’t wish to suggest that targeting
counts for nothing. Certainly, you can see solid trends across socio-economic
groups, and in other similarly broad categories. Premium brands do indeed
appeal to people with more money, for instance. That’s obvious. But when it
comes to the juice, the interesting stuff like archetypes and cultural niches,
then the picture is much less clear, and you can free yourself to have much
more fun.

Never fall into the trap of believing that the people you target are the
people who actually buy you. Life isn’t that simple. And thankfully it’s not
that boring either.
