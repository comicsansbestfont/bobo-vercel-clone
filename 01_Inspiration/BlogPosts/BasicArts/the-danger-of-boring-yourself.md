The thing about churning out one of these essays every week, is that it forces
me to constantly be focusing on the “next” thing: the next idea, the next
theory, the next technique, the next talking point.

In general this is no bad thing, as it helps me to continuously deepen my
knowledge, and hopefully is reasonably entertaining for the reader too.
However it does have a distinct downside:

**The pathological focus on the new at the expense of the old.**

To show you what I mean, I’ll give you a specific example. The other day
somebody was going through my little email course, and they dropped me a note
to say that they liked the following point:

_“To find new market space you normally have to surrender existing market
space. That means essentially giving up on the portion of the market your
competitors are fighting over.”_

This idea is obviously at the heart of my whole “anti-competitive” schtick,
and a central characteristic of my work. But you know what? I’d not written
about it, spoken about it, or even thought about it in ages.

You see to me, this concept is “old news”. Although it’s baked into my process
automatically, it’s no longer something I bring up in my writing or in
discussions with prospective clients. I’ve moved on.

I’m sure you can see the error here.

Whilst this idea may be old for me, it’s new for 99.9999% of the people I’m
ever likely to encounter. It isn’t a spent force. On the contrary, it’s still
got as much juice as it did the first day I put it out there. An yet, in spite
of this, I ignore it completely. I’m leaving that potential value withering on
the vine, for no better reason, if I’m honest, than that I’m _bored_ of it. My
focus is now on more recent, but not necessarily more effective ideas.

In business we see this all the time. Companies – or moreover the executives
within them – get bored of their own fodder long before their customers do.
This stands to reason right? After all they’re hearing the same old stuff day
after day – so of course they’d want to freshen it up now and then.

But what they miss – what we all miss really – is that the public’s
perspective is totally different. They aren’t intimately entwined with this
organisation. On the contrary they basically never think it about it at all.
Even the most loyal of customers are probably only paying an hour or two’s
attention to it a _year_. And that’s before we take into account the huge
portion of the market _who have never even heard of it at all_.

For these people, even the oldest and most stale of offering / brand / product
variant / message is still fresh and effective. And thus premature abandonment
of these things can really hurt the organisation.

For an obvious illustration we can think about the way most companies treat
branding. As I’m sure many of you have experienced, it’s totally standard for
many organisations to “update” their brand platform every 3 or 4 years.

In my lifetime I can recall Coca-Cola using the following straplines at
various points:

  * Always Coca-Cola
  * Always the real thing
  * Enjoy
  * Life tastes good
  * Make it real
  * The Coke side of life
  * Open happiness
  * Taste the feeling
  * Together tastes better
  * Real magic

Now perhaps they have some sophisticated rationale for this, but a more likely
cause to me is simply that it’s quite boring to work for Coke. The thing
basically runs itself – I mean it’s not like supermarkets are about to de-list
you right? So you’ve got to find something to amuse yourself, and new creative
like this is as good a thing as any. It won’t do much good, but it won’t do
much harm either. It’s just somewhere to chuck your profits, and have a bit of
a laugh.

Factor in a few new marketing directors who want to “make their mark”, and
you’ve got yourself a recipe for constant pointless change.

Contrast this with Nike or Red Bull, say, and you’ll see the folly. Nobody
would call them marketing slouches, but they’ve _never_ changed their core
platform. Nobody ever says it’s time to freshen up “Just Do It”, or find
something more relevant than “Gives You Wings”. And that’s because _from the
outside perspective_ , these things never get old. People don’t pay enough
attention for them to become boring. At worst they become simply _familiar_ –
which is hardly a crime in the field of branding now is it?

And seriously, don’t get me started on all the brands out there who are most
famous for ad campaigns, jingles, and tag lines that they abandoned 20, 30
years ago. Honestly, I think that many big brands would be well served to dig
out whatever their most iconic piece of advertising was, and simply re-run it.
You can almost guarantee it would make more of an impact than rolling the dice
on a new piece of work, which even if successful wouldn’t have the hard-won
memory structures to fall back on.

I understand we have this idea of customers being attracted to “newness”, but
I think this is only true in limited circumstances. The more powerful force –
as any “How Brands Grow” advocate would tell you – is the old mental
availability chestnut; in some senses the opposite of “new”.

Anyway, I’m using brand and advertising to make my point here since they are
the most noticeable aspects of a business’ public image – but make no mistake,
the pathology is not limited to these fields.

**Ultimately the greatest brands are at their heart exercises in relentless
repetition. Doing the same thing over and over again, letting it age like fine
wine, and resisting the ego-driven urge to change.**

Clearly this doesn’t mean one should ignore the new either. Certainly for my
part I’ll keep doing what I’m doing, and putting new ideas out there. The
trick is simply to do this whilst also protecting, respecting, and not
becoming bored by the ideas that came before.

It’s a tricky line to walk, but costly if you fall off either side.
