Ever notice how much better it is when your favourite song comes on the radio
compared to when you listen to it on Spotify?

It’s weird isn’t it. You’re driving along, radio humming away as background
noise, and then you hear those first couple of beats and suddenly it’s volume
up, windows down, hand beating the steering wheel – a feeling of elation all
because of a track you could have listened to any time with only a couple of
clicks.

There are probably various reasons for this, such as the element of surprise,
which is lacking when you put on the song for yourself. But perhaps the
bigger, more subtle reason can be summarised like this:

**The effect of a piece of information changes the more people there are who
know about it.**

That song on the radio differs from the same song on Spotify in one crucial
fashion: lots of other people are listening to it too. In fairness that may
also be true of Spotify, but it doesn’t _feel_ that way; it feels like you’re
listening alone. But on the radio you _know_ that there are thousands of
others simultaneously experiencing the same thing, and this enhances its
power.

More than just enhancing its power, lots of people knowing a piece of
information can actually change its _meaning_ too. The precise way this works
is quite complex and little understood, but when you think about it it can be
extremely profound.

Take perhaps the polarisation around COVID policy back in the day. Everyone
believed they were judging each piece of information based on its merits, and
coming to an appropriate conclusion. And probably if they’d been looking at it
in a private vacuum, they would be. But, as is clear from the political
divisions on this topic, that’s not the case. Yes, people were judging the
information on its merits. But they were also (perhaps more so) judging the
information based on the responses of other people to it. Supposedly
“objective” facts are utterly transformed by the knowledge that millions of
others know them too; infected by association and speculation.

It’s enough to make any sane person doubt their own preferences. Do you really
think what you think? Believe what you believe? Like what you like?

I thought of this dilemma the other day when I read a [great
article](https://meltingasphalt.com/ads-dont-work-that-way/) by Kevin Simler
applying it to advertising. It’s a fun read, so check it out, but sufficed to
say the core idea is that one of the primary ways advertising works is through
a process called “cultural imprinting”.

What does this mean?

Well, the author’s contention is basically that we use products for
_signalling_ – i.e. “what does using this product tell other people about
me?”. The main example in the piece is that of Corona beer, and how bringing
this to a party signals that you are a laid back chill kind of person. Now in
order for this signalling to work, it’s not enough that we personally believe
Corona is a “beer for chill people” – _we have to know that others believe it
too_. That way we know that when they see us with it, our signal will be
understood.

This then is the role of advertising: to _imprint_ a certain view of a brand
on popular culture, so that people can then use it for intelligible personal
signalling.

Note how this differs from normal assumptions of how advertising works.

Most people think that the role of creative ads is to build associations
between a certain emotion and a brand, so you feel subconsciously positively
towards it, and thus buy it in the future. If this were true it wouldn’t
matter if you were the only person on the planet who had seen an ad, since the
association would still have been built inside your head. However according to
the cultural imprinting theory, this _wouldn’t_ work, since ads need to have
been seen by millions of other people to facilitate signalling. Without that
wider knowledge, any association the ad builds is useless.

**Bottom line, the more people who are aware of an ad, the more effective it
becomes for each one of them.**

Part of the evidence for this theory – which isn’t totally accurate, but is
pretty compelling nonetheless – is that you rarely get big ad campaigns for
products which others don’t _see_ you use. If a product is used in private
(like say bedsheets), then it has no signalling potential: thus brand
advertising is ineffective. It is only highly _public_ products (like soft
drinks and sneakers) which can really employ cultural imprinting to its full
effect.

Now if you want my view, I think this theory is largely correct. Or at least
_more_ correct than the “emotional association” theory most believe.

It certainly explains why targeted digital ads are so ineffective compared to
mass outdoor campaigns. When you see a digital ad, for all you know you’re the
only one who’s ever seen it – so who cares? But when something is plastered
all over town you know everyone else has seen it too – thus it becomes
important information.

But what are its strategic implications?

Well, it suggests that brands need to behave differently depending on the two
following factors:

  1. Their signalling potential
  2. Their level of fame

Taking the first point – signalling potential – we can see that _the more
public the consumption of a product_ , the more important having an “emotive”
/ “meaningful” brand is.

Being human, we want such products to say something about us, and so therefore
these brands would be well advised to create such a narrative. “This brand is
for people like this”. By comparison _non-signalling_ brands are perhaps
better advised to have more function-led strategies. “This product does
something these other products don’t”.

_(As I’ve said before great brands have an equal blend of both function and
brand in their strategies – but nevertheless this idea helps indicate where
the priority should lie.)_

As for the second point – the level of fame – we can see another interesting
implication. Basically if your brand can’t afford mass advertising – i.e. to
become famous – then there’s little to be achieved in being solely brand-led.
You could create the sexiest identity ever, but if few people know about it it
will have no signalling potential, and thus be impotent.

A client illustrated this brilliantly the other day when he pointed me in the
direction of the ads for the original iPhone. Apple – the masters of stripped
back, brand-led, “feeling” based advertising – did the unthinkable: a grimy
laundry list of features and benefits. Check it out:

Now in fairness this kind of thing was coupled with some more artistic brand
advertising too, but even so it makes sense when we consider the unfamiliarity
of the product at the time. Products that aren’t famous, and are seeking to
achieve that initial entry into the market, may be better served with more
functional arguments. They can – and probably should – evolve to more brand-
led strategies over time, just as the iPhone did. But starting from a position
of obscurity, that’s probably not the best bet.

To put a bow on all this, I reckon this handy matrix does the job:

Is this always right? No, I don’t think so. But I think what ideas like this
demonstrate is just how immensely subtle the dynamics at play with strategy
and information really are. We will never get to the bottom of them. We will
never master them. We can only hope to glimpse blunt approximations of
reality; nothing more.

So whatever you do, don’t slavishly adhere to such ideas like they’re gospel.
They aren’t. Instead use them to make your thinking more loose, more fluid.
Because the goal of such frameworks isn’t to tie you down, but to help you
break free of frameworks altogether.
