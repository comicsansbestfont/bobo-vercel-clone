Let me tell you an important story.

It’s about the time I was at a conference with Donald Miller – creator of the
Storybrand system, and someone I deeply admire.

For those of you who don’t know, Storybrand is basically a technique for
writing your brand copy in the format of a story – with a hero, villain, etc.
It’s great stuff, makes things super clear, and I would advocate it for every
client I work with.

But…

…there is a problem.

And that brings me to my story.

At this conference Miller explained the basic framework to describe what your
business does to customers – essentially a “problem – solution – end state”
model. And then he invited founders in the audience to write theirs, shout it
out, and he’d critique it.

Let me tell you, _people went nuts_.

It was more like a Bieber concert that business conference. For most of them,
this was the first time they’d ever been able to coherently explain what their
business did – and that’s a powerful drug.

One by one, they stood and read out their little scripts.

Pool cleaners.  
Gym chains.  
IT consultants.  
Car dealers.

And sure enough each one was crisp, succinct, and convincing.

But you know what else?

_None of them were going to work._

Because you see what none of the founders realised is that they hadn’t created
scripts for _their_ specific businesses. They’s actually created scripts for
**_any_** business in their sector.

A script that would apply to **_any_** pool cleaner.  
A script that would apply to **_any_** gym chain.  
A script that would apply to **_any_** IT consultant.  
A script that would apply to **_any_** car dealer.

And because of that, none of these scripts could ever be expected to tip the
scale in their favour.

Now look I want to be super clear here. First, this is not a criticism of
Donald Miller or his work _at all_. Like I said, his stuff is awesome. He is
not responsible for what these businesses do, just how they say it.

_(And to be fair, their new-found clarity probably did come in handy. After
all, it’s better to be generic and clear than generic and confusing, which is
what they were before)_

But what this story shows is the fundamental problem with almost _every_
business system, framework, or program:

**Great technique + shoddy strategy = bad results**

Without leverage, without meaningful differentiation, it simply doesn’t
_matter_ how smart the sales funnel is. Or the branding framework. Or the
automation systems.

If the business is fundamentally offering something which is confused,
generic, or low value none of these things can fix it.

And yet founders spend _thousands_ duct-taping world class tactics to their
low-leverage businesses and end up tearing their hair out screaming that
“nothing works!”.

But the tactics _do_ work.

It’s not the tactics.

It’s you.

Tactical excellence – what almost all business programs are selling – will
supercharge a great business idea, but they won’t create it.

No matter how much you tune a car’s engine, it won’t go any faster if it has
no wheels. And that’s why you’ve got to get the fundamentals right before you
start tuning.

And in my opinion this is what makes the Strategy Shortcut System so
different.

Because it’s the only program that does the hard yards to ensure your business
is offering genuinely differentiated value _before_ accelerating it with
operational excellence.

When you’ve got this nailed, _then_ you can go crazy with all the other
techniques and programs.

The value you get from them will increase 100x, because they’ll be applied to
a business that actually works.

Stop wasting time.

Stop wasting money.

Do the first thing _first_.

Whether it’s with me, with someone else, or on your own – just do it.

Because until then, it’s all academic.
