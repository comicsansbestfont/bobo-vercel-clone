I don’t really know if what I’m about to write here is true.

I haven’t fully thought it through, and even if I did, I probably wouldn’t
have the data to prove it either way. But true or not, it’s _elegant_. And as
Paul Dirac said, “A theory of beauty is more likely to be true than one that
fits the experimental data”.

So let’s just go for it.

I think you can identify “strategic eras” in business, whereby there is a
general “stock strategy” that most great businesses in that time period use to
get leverage.

Of course if I was being “purist” about it I would say the strategy for each
business is unique – based on its specific context and market factors. This is
true. But equally there is a _higher_ context that _all_ businesses share
regardless of sector, that enables us to predict the _general_ strategy that
might work for most of them.

In other words, if in doubt, you can just adopt the general strategy of your
era, and probably do OK.

So what are these strategies?

I reckon it’s something like this:

**1960 -1980:** Supply strategy  
**1980 – 2000:** Optimisation strategy  
**2000 – present:** Democratisation strategy

The logic runs something like this.

First we had a period where there was less supply of each good than the market
wanted. Therefore the way to win was simply to answer that demand. If you read
Phil Knight’s book _Shoe Dog_ , you can see that the story of Nike in that era
was fundamentally one of generating supply – almost nothing to do with “brand”
at all.

Then, as production and communication became cheaper and more advanced, the
supply issue was solved so we entered a new era: optimisation. Here it wasn’t
just about supplying the thing, but improving its efficacy and quality. Most
industries at this point were dominated by clearly sub-optimal offerings, so
there was a lot of headroom to do things “better”. Of course I always warn
people against “better” strategies, but that’s because the options in most
industries today are pretty good – but this wasn’t true back in 1988.

Finally when satisfactory quality became the norm we entered the modern era,
which is one of democratisation. To understand this fully, you have to
recognise that the optimisation era created a lot of complexity and
inaccessibility as a by-product of the rush to “improve”. You can visualise
this clearly if you think about the stuffy, formal, faux-scientific consulting
climate of the 1990s. You _wanted_ things to appear complex because this
implied efficacy and sophistication. This then created the opportunity for
democratisation: making everything more simple, informal, human, and friendly.

The archetypal example of this (which probably ushered in the era) was the
original colourful iMac back in 1999 – but there are loads of other examples.

  * Starbucks democratised real Italian coffee
  * Zara democratised high fashion trends
  * Amazon democratised e-commerce
  * Tesla democratised EVs
  * Etc etc

Look around today and you can see ever more brands doing the same thing in new
industries – e.g. Canva has democratised design, or how Alex Smith (ahem) is
democratising strategy.

There is this giant wave of democratisation tearing through every industry on
the planet, **_but_** they are all falling at different rates. Some industries
were democratised 20 years ago. And some haven’t been democratised yet. And
yet this is the macro story they all share.

The hallmarks of a democratisation strategy include:

  * Hiding or removing complexity
  * Direct informal language
  * Heavy emphasis on design
  * Digitisation (many would say this is the macro strategy itself, but it isn’t, it’s a subset of democratisation)
  * A dramatic lowering of costs

You’d be well-served to consider your own industry, and give it a score as to
how democratised it has become. If you’re lucky, it will still be early on
this curve, stuck in the optimisation era, and then there’s probably some
serious hay to be made.

Examples of industries that are yet to fully democratise are:

  * Higher education
  * Consulting
  * Most medicine
  * Law
  * Elements of real estate
  * Etc.

Basically any industry that still has a whiff of “expertise” about it (which
is a hangover from the optimisation era) still needs to be democratised.

**The one remaining question here is: what comes next?**

What comes after democratisation? Are there any clues, or early movers? And
what should you do if you’re in an already-democratised industry?

Honestly I don’t know. But if we want a clue we need to look at the
_downsides_ of the prior era, leading to a _correction_ in the new.
Optimisation was a correction of supply, and democratisation was a correction
of optimisation. So what would be a correction of democratisation?

My prediction would be “humanisation”. Sorry this is a crap word, but
basically I mean shifting brands and industries more underneath the
stewardship of famous individuals. The reason this might occur is because
democratisation tends to “flatten” industries and make them kinda bland.
Indeed democratisation is responsible for the “blanding” trend, if you’re
familiar with that term. Putting actual human faces front and centre is a
great way to remedy that, and there are already plenty of examples of this –
for example with the YouTuber-led brand launches from Mr Beast, Logan Paul,
etc.

There are probably other ways to combat the blandness of democratisation
without leaning on a human being. Any injection of personality, character, and
exclusivity also does the job. Liquid Death did this. Aimé Leon Dore did this.
Anything that attacks democratisation’s “we are for everyone” ethos with a “we
are not for everyone” response.

But understand: this **_only_** works in industries that have been made fully
accessible.

If you overlay this onto an industry still dominated by optimisation, you’re
just adding weirdness to complexity. Not a great blend.

So there you go. Zero thinking required. Just see where your industry is on
this timeline, and execute accordingly. That’ll be $70,000 please.

Or… this could all be bollocks.

I’m not sure. But it was fun to write about anyway.
