If I had to use one word for the advent of AI:

It wouldn’t be “exciting”.  
It wouldn’t be “scary”.  
It wouldn’t be “revolutionary”.

No, it would be “annoying”.

As in, I find it extremely annoying to have to learn this whole new thing and
adapt my processes and systems just to stand still.

Yes, I know, not very sophisticated of me, but that’s the truth

But still, now that I have adapted (somewhat) to it, I’ll admit that some of
the incremental benefits are starting to show themselves.

Not for me personally – but for my wider mission to democratise strategy, and
get more founders doing it.

**Put simply, AI can make strategy far easier.**

And so I welcome it.

But only if its strengths and limitations are well understood – because
otherwise it might make a bad situation worse.

So what are those strengths and limitations?

And how should we use it accordingly?

Here are my conclusions so far:

## **Limitations**

The first, and most important message to take on board is this:

**AI can’t tell you what your strategy should be.**

I will admit that if you are a business with zero strategic focus, then
getting it to tell you what to do may well be better than nothing. Sure, it’ll
be “best practicey” type stuff, but many people don’t even have that figured
out, so let’s not dismiss it out of hand.

But such mediocrity isn’t the goal, is it?

And mediocrity is the limit of AI-created strategy.

There are two main reasons for this.

The first is simply its lack of knowledge. This seems a weird thing to say for
something with seemingly godlike levels of info at its disposal, but we must
remember that it only knows stuff that has been recorded and written down –
which is actually a tiny amount of reality writ large.

For example, it should be obvious that it knows far less about your business
than you do – because only a tiny fraction of information about your business
exists in the public domain.

Of course you can tell it a lot, but it will never be able to match your
gestalt view of things – let alone your intuitive ability to prioritise
information in a natural hierarchy.

(Hierarchy of information is more important than quality or quantity of
information – but that’s a deep technical discussion for another day)

Point is, you should never forget that you are the authority, not it.

The second reason it can’t tell you what your strategy should be is that it’s
incapable of judgement.

It doesn’t “think” – which is easy to forget given that it mimics human speech
codes, leading to us giving it more human characteristics than it actually
has.

(An interesting example of this can be seen with this viral clip, which
demonstrates how its “false reasoning” works – making errors that no human
would ever make)

Unfortunately, because of this lack of discernment, it will be able to give
you a pretty convincing argument in favour of any strategy if you ask it to –
which just goes to show that its enthusiasm for one thing or another is hollow
and not to be trusted.

Again, you are the one whose enthusiasm is valid. (Or “more” valid anyway)

## Strengths

Once we accept that an LLM is not replica of the human brain (despite
appearing like one), and so has weaknesses that we don’t, we are also able to
recognise that it has strengths that we don’t.

And it’s these strengths that we want to use.

Other than some very obvious things like research, which I won’t waste time
discussing here, the main thing AI excels at (especially for strategy
development) is this:

**Pattern recognition.**

And this is pretty useful, because this is exactly what strategy is: a
pattern.

I’ve written thousands of words in this newsletter basically saying “good
strategy has X characteristic and not Y characteristic”, and taken together
these words represent the mapping of a universal pattern that strategy needs
to adhere to, regardless of content.

For example if we take two classic strategy case studies like Southwest
Airlines and the Nintendo Switch, we can see that although their content is
completely different, their patterns are nearly identical.

And it’s AI’s ability to spot these patterns where it really becomes a weapon.

Basically it can tell you whether the thing you’re looking at is a strategy or
not.

Not if it’s a good strategy.

But merely if it is one.

And this is something most humans are astoundingly bad at; constantly tricking
themselves, weaselling their way out of difficult decisions, and doing
everything in their power to create insipid “non-strategies” that leave them
feeling good but ultimately accomplish nothing.

Pattern recognition also helps us in strategy development.

You see the process we go through to arrive at a strategic breakthrough is
also a pattern. At least the one I’ve developed is. And it’s a pattern that AI
can carry us through with focus and discipline – where we would be at risk of
veering off at a tangent.

We might summarise the division of responsibilities like this:

  * **The human** is responsible for the content of the strategy.
  * **The AI** is responsible for the structure of the strategy

This actually means that we must use AI in precisely the opposite way most of
us tend to.

Instead of :

**Human prompts.**  
**AI answers.**

It should be:

**AI prompts.**  
**Human answers.**

The prompt provides the structure – the frame of the conversation. The answer
provides the content. The meat. The thing that needs to be judged with a
sensitive human eye.

## So here’s what I’ve done

To test these theories, I’ve built the first and only strategy bot to work
exactly this way:

  * It prompts you
  * **You answer**
  * It shapes
  * **You judge**

…all based on a colossal amount of training I’ve given it off the back of my
no-bs process (so it’s fast, fun, and contrarian – not just useful).

As one of my early testers said:

“OK, I’m dying, it even SOUNDS like you!”

(Not quite sure how good a thing that is, but at least it’s not generic)

I believe this back and forth makes the most of the unique abilities of AI,
and the unique abilities of you as the founder.

In early testing the results have been frightening.

People are able to arrive at a solid hypothesis, laid out in full strategy
document form, in as little as 20 mins.

Yes, they need some extra shaping from me and the founder. The creative leaps
aren’t of the quality and originality the human can do. But that’s no big
deal, because the creative leaps aren’t the issue – it’s the structuring where
people struggle.

And now, they don’t have to.

So far the AI coach has only been available to members of the full Strategy
Shortcut System community.

But I’ve now introduced a mid-tier program – Shortcut Guided – to let others
play with it at a cheaper price. It also includes one 15-minute recorded
teardown of your strategy from me. So you can produce, get snap feedback,
adapt, and arrive at what is by far the most cost effective strategy
development program on the planet.
