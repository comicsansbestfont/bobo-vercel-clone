If you’re reading this, two things can be assumed:

  1. You have seen the new [Gillette ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0&frags=pl%2Cwn)
  2. You have an opinion on the new Gillette ad

Now, for our purposes here what that opinion is doesn’t matter. Don’t worry,
this piece is strictly about strategy, not politics. All that matters is the
one thing we can certainly agree on, namely that it’s proved to be quite
polarising. Nothing wrong with that of course. Given that the first
responsibility of an ad is to be noticed, it’s actually a pretty good play.
And yet the general consensus seems to be that this particular play, in spite
of the considerable noise it’s generating, isn’t going to work out well for
Gillette. Not, it should be stressed, because of the rights or wrongs of the
ad’s actual content. No, the mistake is something far more basic: the
marketer’s fallacy.

The fallacy goes something like this:

Say you observe the broad market for your company, and you notice that you
seem to do particularly well with person type A, and particularly poorly with
person type B. What should you do?

**Option 1** – Intensify your marketing towards person type A, with the aim of
driving ever greater penetration and depth with that part of the market,
whilst ignoring or even alienating person type B.

Or:

**Option 2** – Take person type A for granted (they’re already in the bag),
and make a concerted push to bring person type B on board, thus broadening
your market share.

The fallacy is option 2. It seems to make sense on the face of it – after all,
type B represents huge untapped potential, and if they were onboard would
double the size of your business overnight. But it’s a fantasy. If your brand
is rejected by a certain group of people, it will likely be for a more
fundamental reason (e.g. product etc.) than an ad can overcome, and even if
you did overcome it, it would probably be at the expense of those who _do_ buy
your schtick. It’s the classic “you can’t be all things to all people unless
you choose to be utterly bland and neutral” dilemma.

Without naming names, I’ve seen many businesses over the years who fell for
this fallacy, and the failure rate was always 100%. The best case scenario is
that nobody notices or cares what you’re saying in your ads, and so your
market dynamics don’t change meaningfully. The worst is that your new target
(type B) _applauds your marketing_ , but _doesn’t convert_ for the fundamental
reasons they weren’t buying in the first place, whilst your core customer
(type A) gets pissed off for being ignored / alienated and takes their
business elsewhere.

Currently it’s looking like Gillette are going to fall victim to that worst
case scenario. We can predict this thanks to [Glocalities data publicised by
Mark
Ritson](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6491550774869483520).

First, a touch of context. Few industries have been more disrupted in recent
years than shaving, thanks primarily to the emergence of Dollar Shave Club,
and latterly, Harry’s. Their explicit undermining of Gillette’s position with
vastly-cheaper-supposedly-better-quality blades, has seen the P&G giant start
to be hollowed out from underneath, particularly when it comes to a younger,
more metropolitan audience. This doesn’t mean Gillette are finished by any
means – they still dominate the market by some distance – but it does mean
they are proving more successful with some audiences than others.

The Glocalities data, drawn from 5,000 Gillette consumers across 14 countries
suggests that these Gillette-friendly audiences tend to be part of the
“Achievers” or “Conservative” segments, whilst where they underperform is with
“Challengers” and “Socilaizers” – the precise audiences, as Ritson observed,
“open to a critique of ‘toxic masculinity’”. Further to this he added:

> _When you look at what societal issues stir Gillette consumers versus
> average consumers, gender equality lands dead last. Existing Gillette
> consumers are far less inspired by the message of the ad. Hence the negative
> responses on social media from Gillette users / former users and the
> generally positive comments from others._

The upshot of this, contrary to what we an assume were Gillette’s
expectations, will not be indifference from their core audience, and a massive
conversion from the audience with which they underperform. It will instead be
derision from their core, and _praise but not conversion_ from the others.
Anyone who switched away from Gillette in the past few years had their reasons
for doing so (be they cost, quality, delivery mechanism, or anti-corporatism);
all things more fundamental than advertising, and things this campaign does
nothing to address. Liking a brand’s ad _is not synonymous with purchase_ –
that requires a basic openness to the brand / product as a bedrock, with a
great ad being the cherry on the cake.

Not that it would have ever happened, but if Gillette had wanted to do a
polarising, politically charged ad that would have been successful from a
_sales perspective_ , then their content should have been precisely the
opposite; a celebration of the unreconstructed male. Just like now they would
have received generous helpings of both praise and criticism, only the people
praising them would have been realistic potential customers (“Achievers” and
“Conservatives”), whilst those criticising them would have been people who’d
never buy Gillette in the first place (“Challengers” and “Socializers”). This
“anti-fallacy” approach to controversy is of course that employed by exercise
supplements brand Protein World with their “Beach Body Ready” campaign (one of
the most commercially successful pieces of work of the decade), and by Nike
with their Colin Kaepernick work. In both cases the brands “preached to the
choir”, and the criticism they received only served to deepen and intensify
the affection of those actually prepared to open their wallets.

Marketing, generally speaking, is a far more effective tool for _reinforcing_
a brand’s position than _moving_ it, or even creating it (that largely happens
organically). The most celebrated marketers (Nike, Apple, Red Bull, etc.) all
share the habit of having consistently and relentlessly burrowed deeper and
deeper into their respective grooves, all the while ignoring (or even often
antagonising) those outside it. If a brand can’t get their head around this,
and instead indulge the dangerous fantasy of using advertising for market-
share “raids” into spaces where others are far better equipped, then they’ll
get the results their hubris, naivety, and greed deserve.
