Your language determines your thoughts.  
Your thoughts determine your actions.  
Your actions determine your results.

So I guess in a sense those postmodernists were right about something – the
way you use language matters. More than you think.

Luckily however we don’t need to overthink it too drastically when it comes to
business. In fact there are just two words we can use which will make the
world of difference.

They are:

Yes, really. Before I dig into what makes these two words so special, let me
back up a sec to lay the context.

The biggest anchor holding your business back is always _a belief in things
that simply aren’t true_. We are all guilty of this – much more than we know –
because human beings will always sugar coat reality for all manner of
psychological reasons. Perhaps to make ourselves feel better. Perhaps to
protect our egos. Perhaps to avoid difficult conversations. Whatever the
reason, it happens, and it normally manifests in bogus beliefs about:

  * The merits of our offering versus competitors
  * Why our customers choose us
  * Why other people _don’t_ choose us
  * What the major problems are in the business right now

…and all manner of other mission critical stuff which it’s damn important to
have a handle on.

When we don’t know the truth of these things, we make dumb decisions. We
become incapable of growth, and keep getting poor results without
understanding why.

If I was being super blunt about it, I’d say that _every_ client I’ve ever had
has been utterly deluded on two or three critical fronts when I started
working with them. This doesn’t say anything about them – I’m equally deluded
when it comes to my own stuff – it’s just part of the human condition.

So, needless to say, we need some help getting over this.

And the words “really” and “actually” have a magical quality when it comes to
that.

The way you use them is very simple. Just ask all the usual important
questions you might ask about your business if you were looking to drive it
forwards – but then shove one of these words in, and ask them again.

So **“how are we different from our competitors?”**  
Becomes **“how are we _really_ different from our competitors?”**

So **“why do our customers choose us?”**  
Becomes **“why do our customers _actually_ choose us?”**

So **“does our marketing messaging work?”**  
Becomes **“does our marketing messaging _actually_ work?”**

I know the difference seems trivial, but the second question will get
startlingly different (and more useful answers). The game is particularly
powerful if you ask the question _without_ the words first (so people get the
lies and delusions out of their system), and then ask the adapted question
straight afterwards. In this way people will feel compelled to give a
different answer to their previous one, increasing your likelihood of getting
to the bottom of things.

Most companies out there could do with a “blood letting” of this kind.
Certainly the ones who aren’t growing as fast as they’d like. A kind of
seismic “inquisition” where you put all this stuff on the table and paint a
portrait of the business as it _really_ is today.

From that point, you’ll be far better positioned to make some choices that are
_actually_ going to have a positive effect on the business.

Needless to say this can be politically tricky, and you’re going to have to
manage the way you do it. But even then, I’d say that if these sorts of
discussions create political problems for you, then that very fact IS your
problem.

That sort of decadent cowardice is (sort of) OK for a multi-billion dollar
corporation which is in churn mode. But for a business with any kind of
serious growth ambitions, it’s total poison.

So, if you _really_ want to understand your business, _actually_ give this a
try. And let me know if you uncover anything remarkable.
