I spend a lot of time here talking against herd behaviour; against the
reflexive urge, we all have to copy and to cluster – particularly in business.

It should be acknowledged, however, that not all [herd
behaviour](https://basicarts.org/break-invisible-rules-the-easiest-way-to-
stand-out/) is necessarily illogical or counterproductive. We are all swimming
in the same cultural waters, and sometimes a wave of opportunity sweeps
through which is so big that it’s natural for everyone to try and ride it –
even if to do so is totally unoriginal.

**For an example of such a wave, look no further than the swell of interest in
sustainability.**

Eco, green, responsible – call it what you want, this is by some distance the
most common [strategic territory](https://basicarts.org/fit-in-to-stand-out/)
I see both with my clients and the world at large. It’s one of those funny
ideas which every brand frames as an act of rebellion, or cutting against the
status quo when it has in fact become one of the most establishment play you
could possibly make.

This isn’t to denigrate it: aside from its intrinsic worth (admittedly
sometimes more authentic than others), it undeniably affords certain brands
huge leverage. If we exclude legacy names like Nike and Coke, perhaps the
majority of non-tech companies making headlines today are employing some form
of “eco-strategy”.

In addition to its perceived effectiveness, an eco-strategy also has a couple
of other notable advantages.

For one thing, it’s easy. Seemingly little insight, category understanding,
creativity, or risk are required to come up with one. And better still, it
makes us look good too. We get to be virtuous people _and_ make our millions
all at the same time. Fantastic. Little wonder everyone’s at it.

There’s just one problem:

**It rarely works.**

It may currently be one of the most successful forms of strategy, but thanks
to its sheer ubiquity it is surely also the most _unsuccessful_ one too. It’s
a basic numbers game. Throw a million sustainable brands against the wall and
you’ll get a couple of world beaters, sure – but you’ll also get 999,998
failures. So, whilst it can be incredibly powerful, it’s not exactly the most
reliable of approaches.

The issue is that people read the success of certain sustainable brands far
too simplistically – assuming, wrongly, that they reflect an insatiable demand
for green credentials which any brand can tap into. It can appear this way, I
admit – but that’s rarely what’s going on. And if you assume it is, you’re
very likely to develop a naive and ineffective strategy.

What I want to explain here then is that whilst there is indeed a growing
demand for this kind of thing, it is not so rampant that it releases brands
from the need for smart thinking. Eco strategies don’t only need to be eco,
_they also need to be strategies_ ; something far too many brands seem to
forget.

## What then are the characteristics of eco strategies that work?

To explain this, it’s helpful to think in terms of “market maturity” – by
which I mean the three phases of eco-consciousness that a category may pass
through, and the types of brand which get rewarded at each phase.

### Phase 1 – Unconscious

The most common error in failed eco strategies is a simple one: nobody cares.
Rightly or wrongly, consumers only perceive ecological issues in a small
number of categories. If you try to provide a sustainable solution in a
category consumers already think is sustainable, then, naturally, it will fail
to cut through. Imagine, say, an eco-friendly crisps brand. In the UK at
least, this doesn’t exist. Why? Not for lack of trying, but simply because
nobody thinks there are any sustainability issues with crisp production. This
doesn’t mean there aren’t any. In fact, I’m sure there are loads. But they
aren’t well known, and as such in this category the green argument has
basically no sway.

If you are a brand in such an unconscious category (as most are), then
although you should of course be encouraged to behave as sustainably as
possible, it would be a mistake to orient yourself exclusively around this
market position. Find something else to do, and cross your fingers that the
ground beneath your feet may start to shift, moving you into…

### Phase 2 – Conscious

Unlike the above categories, there are some others where environmental issues
are very much apparent, even to the most disinterested consumers.

Transportation, dairy, cosmetics, energy, meat: these are all examples of
spaces where eco-consciousness is high. And, as a result, they can sustain
brands with eco-strategies.

_(One could argue of course whether these are the most pressing industries
from a scientific perspective, but that’s by the by. Consciousness is what
matters in the strategy game, and so even if you think another category
deserves to be on this list, there’s little you can do about it until
perception catches up.)_

At first glance, eco-conscious categories seem very easy to exploit. The only
problem however is that generally when a category moves into this phase, the
opportunity for a green option becomes so glaring that it is immediately
gobbled up.

Consider for example the rise of The Body Shop and the Toyota Prius. Both of
these were, in their respective categories, pretty straightforward eco plays,
which emerged just as consciousness arose in their markets. As a result, they
enjoyed massive success. They didn’t need to be sophisticated, and they didn’t
need to be complex. They just had to get the timing right and execute well,
which they did. However, they didn’t leave much space behind for copycat
options. They picked the low-hanging fruit and then it was gone.

Naturally, if you have the opportunity to do something similar to this then
grab it – but it’s pretty unlikely. This leaves you with one final option…

### Phase 3 – Post-Conscious

The thing about brands like the Prius and The Body Shop is this: they’re a bit
“one note”. A bit basic. Yes, they offer a sustainable(ish) solution in a
category where that is desired, but eventually, such categories reach a point
of maturation whereby such standards are expected, and so the offering loses
its teeth.

In these scenarios one-dimensional eco brands become vulnerable to their more
sophisticated successors:

#### **Brands that use eco characterises to enhance a consumer-centric
offering.**

What do I mean by this? Well for the most part simplistic eco strategies don’t
offer much in terms of _consumer_ value. Yes, they tickle ethical buyers who
want to feel like they’re doing the right thing – and that’s powerful – but
they don’t necessarily bring much innovative _performance_ to their category.
The Body Shop isn’t very special when judged purely as a cosmetics brand. And
the Prius is fundamentally a pretty crap car (although cheap to run).

Great next-generation eco-brands solve this problem by using green policies
expressly to enhance the brand’s performance on the core metrics of their
category. Consider for instance how Lush outmanoeuvred The Body Shop. Lush,
through the adoption of sustainable practices, was able to take ownership of
the idea of “fresh” cosmetics. This in turn translated to fun and vibrant
products such as their iconic bath bombs. These factors enabled them to become
highly appealing to both the eco-conscious and non-eco-conscious alike. They
didn’t demand you buy them because you “should”, but because you actually want
to. Their sustainable credentials, whilst crucial, weren’t their sole driver –
as in the case of The Body Shop.

_(You can read a similar dynamic in the transition from the Prius to Tesla as
you can from The Body Shop to Lush)._

When artfully done, using sustainability as the engine for a consumer-centric
offering can even create breakthroughs for brands in unconscious categories. I
would say that toilet paper is not high on many people’s list of
environmentally challenged industries – and yet [Who Gives A
Crap](https://uk.whogivesacrap.org/) have managed to achieve success in that
space with a green proposition. How? Primarily aesthetically. By having no
plastic they were forced to wrap their rolls in paper. This in turn enabled
them to produce a far more beautiful product than their competitors – perfect
for bathroom display. Sure, consumers might argue that their main motivation
is ethical – but experience suggests that it is likely at least in equal
proportion aesthetic. As a result, the brand has been able to smuggle
environmental concerns into a category where such issues are normally pretty
low on the radar.

These post-conscious brands understand that the window of opportunity for one-
dimensional eco plays is limited – and that the future of sustainability in
any category must come through performance, not purely moral coercion.

Ultimately too many brands fail to take this into account. They believe –
wrongly – that sustainable brands should wear their sustainability on their
sleeve; a reason for being in its own right. Although there is undoubtedly a
growing market of conscious consumers who buy into this, such brands will
always be vulnerable to the subsequent generation who not only match their
credentials but _take them for granted_ – choosing instead to focus their
strategic energies on something more meaningful to the average consumer.

So by all means, please be as environmentally conscious as possible. Just
don’t mistake that behaviour for a ready-baked strategy. You still have to
read the market dynamics just as much as everyone else. Or given the
competition, perhaps even more so.
