## The Problem With “Find Your Why”

By now most of you are probably familiar with Simon Sinek’s iconic “Start With
Why” TED talk. Even if you’ve not seen the talk, you’ve most likely
encountered one of the army of why-merchants that have sprung up in his wake.
Asking you “why” it is you do what you do has become something of a cottage
industry, most prevalent in marketing, but with tentacles spreading into all
sorts of business thinking. Encouraging you to find your why.

Before getting into my complaint with this, I will start by saying that it is
truly a terrific talk and important insight. If you’ve not seen the video I
urge you to watch it – here’s a 5 minute edit that hits the key notes:

OK, got it? Great. I think we can agree his central point is clear and
compelling. To build an inspiring business, you need some motivation. You need
a belief, a dissatisfaction with the status quo, something you’re trying to
make better. If you don’t have this (and believe me many businesses don’t),
you’re essentially a parasite, a machine engineered to suck value out of a
market without putting any back in – and nobody wants to participate in that.
So, for sure, having a “why” is fundamentally important, and not something to
be taken for granted.

However, necessary though it might be, it is not sufficient. In fact, too much
focus on your “why” can be positively damaging. Far from creating a new
generation of inspiring and creative businesses as Sinek hoped, slavish “why
chasing” has started to have the _reverse effect_ , with adherents becoming
increasingly insipid and bland.

Here (ahem) is why.

Have you ever tried doing one of those exercises where you ask “why?” to a
question a bunch of times to get to the “real answer”? It has its place, but a
flaw that many people have found with it is that as you keep asking the
question you always end up in the same place – something like “the fear of
death”. Why do people buy our running shoes? Because they like want to run
fast. Why do they want to run fast? Because they want to win. Why do they want
to win? Because they want to be attractive to a mate. Why do they want to be
attractive to a mate? To pass on their genetics. Why do they want to pass on
their genetics? Because they fear death.

Ah, got it! Nike: Fear of death.

You can see the problem here right? If you dig a little, the answer to the
question of why will always become increasingly broad, resulting in all manner
of businesses answering the same fundamental need. OK it might not always be
“fear of death”, but it’s not too far off.

Consider the food industry, and the “purpose” of the new businesses in that
space. To a man, they almost always have a “why” of making people healthier.
Now this is a noble goal, no doubt about it, but it’s not an effective
platform for building a business. Why? Because it’s so broad and bland it does
nothing to distinguish the business in the market. It does nothing to suggest
the value that that specific business adds. I could care _really really
passionately_ about making people healthier, and thus launch, say, a low
calorie mayonnaise, but my “why” wouldn’t help it succeed because the “how” is
so boring and unoriginal. And therein lies the crux: the “why” is only the
fuel; the much-maligned “how” is the thing that makes the business successful
or not.

We can see this with one of Sinek’s own examples in his video. In it he
references Apple as being a business with a really strong “why” of “believing
in doing things differently” / “challenging the status quo”. OK that’s great,
can’t argue with that, but that didn’t mean they made all their employees wear
clown suits and paid them with cookie dough. They instead challenged the
status quo in a _very particular way_. In their heyday, when they really
established their market position, computers we still considered complex and
intimidating to a huge chunk of the non-techy population. So what Apple did
was focus on making computers super easy to use, accessible, friendly, and
even _cute_. The ultimate articulation of this was the original iMac, which
acted essentially as a philosophical template for every Apple product since –
at least until the end of the Steve Jobs era. You can see therefore that
Apple, even though they didn’t spell it out in their ads (where they did
indeed keep things focused on the generic “why” platitude of “Think
Different”) had a very specific, very unique, and very effective “how”. In the
video it’s breezed over as “beautifully designed” and “user friendly”, but
every manufacturer was trying to do that; Apple’s approach was much more
profound and jarring within the context of the day. It was this “how” that
made them a brilliant company, that gave the public something they wanted.
Their “why” simply provided the passion, and only worked as a piece of comms
because the realities of the business supported it so brilliantly.

Now I don’t think for a moment that Sinek dismisses the importance of “how” in
a larger sense, but many people seem to have taken that unintended lesson from
him. The world is littered with uninspired, unoriginal companies that provide
little unique vale, and yet who are talking big games with their “why” because
it’s so cheap to do so; a marketing gambit which they don’t seem to realise
only _accentuates_ their blandness, rather than diminishing it.

So, by all means make sure your business has a good reason to exist, a reason
you “get out of bed in the morning”. Without this, you’ve got nothing. But,
when you’ve got that, ensure that the way you’re achieving that goal is
effective, valuable, and yours alone. Otherwise, you’ve got nothing other than
good intentions – and those neither sell, nor do they achieve their loftier
goal.

I’ll leave you with [this

Silicon Valley, which does a better job of making my point than I ever could.
If you recognise yourself in this… “think different”.
