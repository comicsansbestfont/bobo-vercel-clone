These essays tend to be a bit wordy, so I thought I’d mix things up today with
a few pictures.

This is courtesy of blogger [David Perell](https://perell.com/), who by chance
compiled a few images the other day which directly speak to some of the trends
we’ve been discussing.

He calls it “The Great Flattening”, by which he means the gradual
homogenisation of aesthetics, architecture, design, and branding into
characterless internationalist blob. We have explored the same phenomenon here
by other names – whether in the case of [blanding](https://basicarts.org/why-
are-startup-brands-so-boring/), [perma-
revolution](https://mailchi.mp/1f18071bd045/framework-13431293), or [post-
culturalism](https://mailchi.mp/a67f3eb56612/boring-yourself-13461985).

Ultimately it’s all the same thing:

**A relentless attack on the particular in favour of the universal generic.**

I wasn’t planning on writing any more about this as I think we’ve covered it
enough. However I just had to share the images from Perell’s post, since it’s
one thing to pontificate on this stuff, but quite another to see it with your
own eyes.

First we have the branding issue, neatly encapsulated by the evolution of
Pepsi over the years:

This is a familiar tale, which you might also have seen visualised in this
famous graphic of the evolution of luxury brands in recent years:

Many have commented that this is particularly strange in the case of luxury
brands, since they are meant to serve as rarified status symbols, and to ooze
luxury. However if we bear in mind that neutrality is now the ultimate status
symbol, and that overt luxury is becoming a bit gauche, then this
contradiction is resolved.

Sticking with the world of branding, we come to these ubiquitous characters,
who you’ve probably seen gracing many a website in the past couple of years:

According to Perell they were originally designed by Facebook by an agency
called Buck, who said:

“We designed and built a scalable system rooted in flat, minimal, geometric
shapes. The figures are abstracted… to help them instantly achieve a universal
feel.”

Scalable, flat, minimal, abstracted, universal – it’s hard to come up with a
better description of the phenomenon than that, and it’s highly apparent when
we move out of the world of branding and into architecture.

Here Perell highlighted a [Twitter
thread](https://twitter.com/culturaltutor/status/1539993488120479747?s=20&t=Mr9HPOkMYffKQlBfi1lAmA)
pulled together by [The Cultural Tutor](https://twitter.com/culturaltutor),
who noted how attempts at beauty in public works and utilities had been
squeezed out by a utilitarian universalism; even down to the tiniest detail:

The irony here is that the philosophical goal of such developments is to make
things inclusive, culturally non-specific, and “for everyone” – however at the
same time it is culturally specific artefacts that attract visitors from all
over the world, who are more than happy to enjoy and admire things that
supposedly “weren’t built for them”.

This reminds me of one of the great strategic fallacies of our time: the
belief that people only like things that act as a mirror, reflecting
themselves back at them.

Certainly there is a grain of truth in this. Sometimes mirroring your audience
as precisely as possible is a smart strategy. Certainly there are many brands
who do that. However equally valid is to attract people with something that is
decidedly  _not_ like them. This might either be something that is elevating
and aspirational, something they “look up to”, or equally it could simply be
something exotic and intoxicating.

It is indicative of the arrogance of the universalist assumption that a
Western tourist would happily marvel at the wonders of Great Zimbabwe, or the
Alhambra, or the temples of Kyoto, but would assume that the same wouldn’t
apply in the reverse.

The fact is that tourists come in their millions to visit Stratford-Upon-Avon,
Oxford, and Westminster Abbey – not Canary Wharf.

Because of this, Perell’s conclusion is that we should reject the great
flattening, and return producing things with personality and particularity.

As a consumer – and indeed as a human being – I agree with him. However while
this is what I would to see, we have to bear in mind that what is “good” is
not necessarily the same as what is “strategic”.

Effective strategies are responsive to grand systemic currents, not,
unfortunately, personal preference, or what is “right” in the abstract. The
changes we discuss here are, yes, partially philosophically driven. But more
than that, they are  _systemically_ driven. They are the unthinking
consequences of the way the world is unfolding.

The fact is that the market does indeed respond positively in many cases the
flattened / blanded / homogenised products. This is for many hard-to-unpack
reasons, including:

  * Cost
  * Status anxiety
  * Fashion
  * Education
  * Etc.

Because of this I don’t think we can assume that those luxury brands would do
better if they reverted to their prior characterful states.

On the contrary, they probably wouldn’t.

When it comes to public works, the story is a little different, because these
aren’t so wedded to the demands of the market. They have a certain
responsibility to be edifying and uplifting, so there I would agree more
readily. However most of us don’t work with such free briefs. Most of us have
to deal with reality as we find it, not as we wish it to be.

Can we reintroduce passion, specificity, personality, and beauty back into the
world through our projects? Yes. But we must do it  _within_ the constraints
of the above reality, not in spite of it.

That is the art of strategy.
