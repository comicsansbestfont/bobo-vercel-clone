Nobody likes to think of themselves as a follower. A sheep. As someone who
slavishly adheres to the rules and behaviours set by everyone else. A herd
animal, mindlessly marching in step with the crowd, never thinking for
themselves.

But the truth is, we all are.

Even the most outrageous rebel will, on 99 metrics out of 100, conform to the
norms of everyone else. David Bowie still brushed his teeth (I assume).
Stanley Kubrick still made movies with a beginning, middle, and end.
Ultimately no matter who you are, it still makes sense to follow the crowd
most of the time, because they’re doing things which have been proven to work,
and there’s no sense in changing.

Needless to say the same thing applies in business. Every category has a
series of norms, which all brands within it slavishly follow, and much of the
time for very good reason.

It’s a norm, for example, for soap to smell nice – and probably a decent one.
By all means you could make soap which smelled horrible, to be a bit of a
rebel, and get a bit of standout. But it would probably be pretty self-
defeating. A nice smell, or at least the absence of bad smell, is probably a
necessary norm in that category; one which probably doesn’t need to be
challenged.

However, not all norms are like that.

Some norms are indeed almost completely arbitrary. There are rules companies
follow for no other reason than that everyone else follows them – rules that
become so embedded in their categories that they become almost invisible.
People adhere to them without even realising they’re doing so, so they cease
to be active choices, and become simply the default setting which nobody
thinks to question.

Norms like this are huge opportunities for brand differentiation.

If you can spot a universal, but completely arbitrary norm in any category,
you’ve stumbled on a golden ticket. Subverting unnecessary norms is by far the
easiest way to stand out, and deliver texture and unique value to a category.
It’s basically a shortcut to effective strategy, and so is something which
every business should search for as one of its first ports of call.

A perfect illustration of this can be found with cleaning brand Method.
