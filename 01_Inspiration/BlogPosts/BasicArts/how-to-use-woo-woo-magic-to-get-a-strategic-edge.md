Look, I happen to think that “woo-woo” works.

By which I mean tapping into esoteric, mystical, even spiritual forces for the
purpose of developing strategy.

I know it sounds crazy, and you don’t have to agree, but in fairness I’m in
pretty good company.

Steve Jobs had everyone at his funeral issued with Paramahansa Yogananda’s
_Autobiography of a Yogi_ , a non-fiction book that speaks of things like
teleportation and transmogrification as if they were as commonplace as blowing
your nose.

Equally a shockingly high number of incredible breakthroughs came to their
creators in their dreams – from the brand name Nike right through to the
periodic table.

Of course there are more rationalistic ways of explaining a lot of this – the
subconscious and such like – but either way it doesn’t really matter. What
matters is simply the “outsourcing” of some of your work to the supra-rational
realms, and having faith in the existence of patterns which are beyond your
ability to unravel.

(Which to be fair is actually a highly scientific belief, not a fantastical
one).

Now, there are varying levels of crazy you can explore with this, but today I
want to talk about a really down-to-earth and humble technique that you can
use in day-to-day strategy development – both for your business, and your
career.

It barely counts as woo-woo to be honest, but it kinda is. We can call it
something like:

**Purpose synchronisation.**

_(And I’m not talking about the whole “business purpose” thing, but rather
purpose in the raw sense of the word)._

The basic idea is as follows.

Imagine each business or person as having a pre-determined purpose in the
world for which they were built. Crucially, this purpose is _not known_ to
either the business or the person – their job instead is to “discover” it.
Once they do, everything will just flow, as there is a sort of “harmony”
between them and the “universe”. A synchronisation.

Long time readers will recognise this as a version of the Dolly Parton
principle – “find out who you are and do it on purpose” – where the
implication is that we don’t choose our path (or the path of our business),
but instead it is chosen _for_ us. Or indeed perhaps it was there all along…

**So the question then becomes: how do we find it?**

Well, unfortunately it is extraordinarily hard, for one big and unfortunate
reason: we human beings are _mimetic_ creatures.

This means we want things not because they are right for us, or in harmony
with our true nature, but rather because we’ve seen _other people_ with them,
and so we want them too.

This mimetic tendency isn’t just a factor in our decision making – it’s the
_default setting_. Almost every un-strategic business (i.e. 95% of them) is
following a mimetic path. Either they are copying their competitors’ moves, or
worse, they are like “Mini Mes” of companies their leaders admire.

_(How many mini-Patagonias are there out there? Or mini-Apples? Or mini-
Innocents?)_

And almost every decision we take for ourselves as individuals is the same
too. Why does every other graduate from Harvard go into banking or consulting?
Because this is the perfect life for these specific people?

Of course not, they do it because _it’s what everyone else does_.

They want _it_ because it’s want _ed_.

The net result of all this is that we think certain paths are “right” for us
simply because we _desire_ them. We think “I know this is right because I want
it so badly, and that proves that it harmonises with my true self”.

But it’s a trick. Our desire for something only has minimal bearing on its
suitability for us, or for our businesses.

So how _are_ we meant to know then?

How are we meant to know what our true purpose is if we are routinely
attracted to _false_ purposes that will lead us to friction and maybe ruin?

The answer is this:

**You enjoy it even when you’re failing.**

You see, false purposes are only enjoyable when they work; when you achieve
the _ends_ you were looking for. But true purposes feel right regardless of
outcome.

Let me give you a personal example.

As I’ve mentioned before, I was kicked out of both EY and L’Oréal. In
hindsight this was good for me, and in both cases I didn’t really enjoy what I
was doing, and routinely felt a heavy case of the Sunday blues. However did
this mean I was _glad_ when I was ejected? Hell no! I was miserable. I fought
hard to keep those jobs. I really wanted them badly, thus illustrating how we
can become attached to something that isn’t right for us.

By contrast, take this newsletter. I was writing this for years before it was
really read in any meaningful numbers. I couldn’t really call it a “success”
until about 6 months ago. But, in spite of that, there was never a time when
it felt difficult, or unpleasant, or like a chore. I was always vibing off it
for its own sake.

And that is the signal: that you can feel the vibes even when the thing isn’t
obviously successful.

There is another, more brutal, way of putting this – the way Charles Bukowski
put it:

**Don’t try.**

Don’t do anything that feels like trying. And to be fair, that guy should
know. He was an unsuccessful writer for _decades_ , working in the post office
to no acclaim… and then wound up being considered the greatest poet of his
generation.

Decades of work, decades of “failure”, but without ever trying.

Let me tell you, personally, I don’t try to do what I do. Not at all. I just
do it. And whether or not I “want” it actually doesn’t even factor into my
thinking. Do birds “want” to fly? Do fish “want” to swim? Does fruit “want” to
ripen?

Sorry, that’s a bit flowery, but you get my point: “wanting” is the wrong
question.

So, move beyond it. Put aside the myth of your desires and instead seek that
effortless synchronicity that makes them redundant.

It might sound like bullshit. But honestly, underneath it all, it’s how
strategy really works.
