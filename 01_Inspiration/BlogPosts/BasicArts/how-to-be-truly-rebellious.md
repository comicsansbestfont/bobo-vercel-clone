In 2022, there’s nothing more conformist than being revolutionary.

I’ve written about this before, but I still think it bears repeating that it
can be quite hard now to find brands who _don’t_ present themselves as being
in some way maverick, rebellious, and counter-cultural – even (or especially)
amongst corporate giants.

They all stand with their fists raised defiantly against “the man”, even if by
all rational analysis they are the man themselves.

How this came to pass is quite interesting. So far as I can tell, it’s all
about the 60s. The cultural eruptions of that decade gave birth to a number of
genuinely contrarian brands such as Apple, Ben & Jerry’s, and Patagonia. In
each case they and their Boomer founders presented a challenge to the stuffy,
traditionalist, suit-wearing archetype of the prior generation, and managed to
triumph.

This however created a curious paradox: a new revolutionary establishment,
with nobody left to revolt against. The counter-cultural zeal, vibe, and
vernacular remained, but without an actual culture to counter. To suggest that
the 60s values represented by these brands are in any way edgy or outside the
mainstream today is laughable – but that doesn’t stop them _pretending_ that
they are. “Sticking it to the man” has become “sticking to the straw man”,
where we all act as if pre-60s culture was still dominant, when in fact we
know in our hearts that it was defeated long ago.

Now don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing especially wrong with this kind of
play acting. LARPing the revolution is fun, stylish, and in a lot of cases
really sells. But let’s not kid ourselves:

**Revolution is now better understood as an aesthetic than an act.**

You don’t have to risk anything for it. You don’t have to earn it. You just do
it as the default. When you live in a world where the most feted children’s
books are things like _Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls_ and _Stories for
Boys Who Dare to be Different_ , you can be sure that the meaning of
“revolution” is a bit different than it used to be.

My question for today then is this: in a world where “rebelliousness” comes so
cheap, what does it take to be actually be a rebel? What does it take to be
truly different, and not just to pretend?

**In short how do we break the rules in a way that actually matters?**

The answer, paradoxically, is to first _follow them_.

No, this isn’t my way of saying that true rebelliousness is being conventional
(although there may be some truth in that). No, what I’m saying is that you
can only break the rules when _you have first mastered them_. You can only be
a rebel when you _have first been a conformist_.

The revolutionary aesthetic has trained us to forget this. In our low-stakes
play acting we are told that all rules are stupid, all norms are there to be
smashed. “Being different” has become the start point rather than end point,
and being disobedient the default.

I grant you that revolution can look like this on the surface, but it isn’t
really how things work.

Revolution is less an _alternative_ to the status quo than it is the thing
that comes _after_ it. It is something that you can only get to by first
passing through the basics, rather than by rejecting the basics all together.
You’ve heard the phrase “you can’t run before you walk”? Well it’s just the
same – “you can’t revolt before you can conform”. They are not separate paths,
they are the _same_ path, just one after the other.

This diagram will help explain what I mean:

This idea of first mastering the rules before you break them crops up in lots
of interesting places.

It can be found as a recurring theme in the Gospels, where Jesus – the
archetypal “master” – constantly breaks religious law, much to the outrage of
the priestly class. The point being made is that when one truly understands
the _meaning of the law_ , you can break the _letter of the law_ in order to
uphold it. The priests, lacking this understanding, cling naively to the rote
rules even when they clash with their larger purpose – and thus are
scandalised by Jesus’ revolutionary acts.

We can also see the idea underpinning much debate in contemporary education.
Many educators agree with Albert Einstein’s famous missive that “education is
not the learning of facts, but the changing of the mind to think”. In other
words (according to some interpretations), we should be focusing on training
rebellious critical thinking, rather than simply memorising boring old
history, maths and Shakespeare. The counterpoint to this however is that it is
only from the foundation of the basics, of being reasonably knowledgable and
disciplined, that critical thinking and innovation become possible.

Einstein himself is an arch example of this, given that he knew a hell of a
lot of facts.

**As for us, in a business context there are lots of interesting implications
to this lesson which are routinely ignored thanks to our revolutionary play
acting.**

First among these is to embrace the learning of business fundamentals. The
rebel myth has trained us to assume that genius comes from the untrained mind,
but for the most part this simply isn’t true.

As a case in point, I recently noticed that one of my former clients was doing
some fantastic marketing – both highly creative, but also precisely on-
strategy. I got in touch with their marketing director and asked “what’s the
secret”, since this is an area where mid-sized brands often struggle. His
answer? Hire trained marketers. It’s boring, but shockingly few brands do this
– assuming that marketing is something that can just be improvised by a couple
of bright and trendy 24 year olds. Sadly it can’t. It has discipline, it has
knowledge – things which are required as a _platform_ before one can launch
into more rebellious territory.

A second, perhaps even more important implication is this: intimately
understand your category.

Again, this sounds obvious, but I don’t think it is. I certainly don’t think
it’s commonly done. Brands who upend category norms aren’t those who just
blaze in “doing things differently” (they fail). No, they are the ones who
_understand the category norms better than anyone else_ – and thus are able to
see beyond them. They know precisely which rules to break, and which to leave
alone because they – like Jesus (weird comparison I know) – _respect the
meaning of those rules_. They don’t just see them as arbitrary rubbish to be
“disrupted” for the sake of it.

One little technique you can use to test your understanding of the category is
this: can you make a strong case for why your biggest competitors are
successful? Too many founders think the other brands in their category are
“crap”, or somehow don’t deserve their success. Or they will explain it away
with some dismissive comment like “they’re cheap”, or “they’ve got lots of
money”. Such weak analysis betrays a lack of understanding. There is a hidden
reason the category behaves the way it does. Only when you’ve uncovered that
secret have you earned the right to question it.

You may have heard of Chesterton’s Fence? Well, it’s a similar thing:

_“Imagine a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of
reformer goes gaily up to it and says, ‘I don’t see the use of this; let us
clear it away.’ To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to
answer: ‘If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it
away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do
see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.’”_

Ultimately there’s a reason why rebels – _real rebels_ – are rare, and it’s
partly because mastery is rare. Mastery is boring, difficult, and time
consuming. And yet it’s the only path through which we can uncover insights
that are truly significant.

So much as it’s fun to style yourself as a fearless free-thinker – and I’m as
guilty as anyone when it comes to that – try to make sure that your contempt
for convention doesn’t run too deep.

It’s only when you respect it that truly new paths open up.
