The other week, I wrote about two of my favourite business words: “really” and
“actually”. But now I want to rail against one of my most _hated_ words:

“Just”.

As in, “isn’t this just…?”, or “aren’t you just talking about …?”.

This is quite personal because I get this quite a lot when sharing strategy
ideas. Basically the pattern is 1) I say “try this _[rare strategy technique]_
”, and then 2) someone chirps up saying “isn’t this just _[general idea that
everyone knows]_ ”. The answer is invariably “no, it’s not that”, but
generally the difference is subtle enough that it’s a reasonable question.

Today I want to address one of the most pernicious “justs” that I receive time
and again, which is this one:

**“Isn’t this just differentiation?”.**

Ahh differentiation. A great word which is horribly misused 95% of the time. I
can see why people think this is what I’m often talking about. For example
I’ll regularly say things like “the market doesn’t notice better, it only
notices different”. And of course I’m constantly encouraging you to find ways
to be different from your competitors.

Isn’t this, therefore, “just differentiation”?

No. It really really isn’t. Let me show you why.

“Differentiation” is typically used to describe a “difference in product”.
It’s very closely related to its other nefarious cousin, the “USP”. People
think that because they have a differentiated product, or a clear USP, they
have solved their strategy issue – but invariably they haven’t.

This is because strategy is _not_ about having a differentiated product.

**Strategy is about offering differentiated _value_.**

To illustrate this, imagine if someone launched a round chocolate bar, in a
sea of rectangular ones. That person would be well within their rights to
claim they had “clear differentiation”. After all, everyone else’s bar is
rectangular, theirs is round, what could be more different than that! They’d
probably tell you it was their USP too.

And yet do we think that idea would take the market by storm?

Very doubtful. Because despite its differentiated _product_ , it doesn’t offer
any differentiated _value_. It’s still just a chocolate bar. It still does the
same job as other chocolate bars. It’s still bought for the same reason as
other chocolate bars. So strategically it is, in fact, _the same_.

Differentiated _value_ is not about the product, it’s about what the customer
gets from the exchange. The value / benefit they accrue. The value of an IKEA
chair is not “a flat-packed chair”. That’s just saying what the product is.
The value of an IKEA chair is “a stylish home at an affordable price”. The
product is merely a tool to deliver that.

Honestly any idiot can create a differentiated product.

Just change the colour, the shape, the features, whatever. There are a million
ways you can change _any_ product to make it different. But if that doesn’t
generate differentiated value for the customer then it’s pointless.

**So can you see how “differentiation” is not actually the game?**

Your product differences may well be a crucial factor in giving the customer
fresh value, but until you’ve figured out what that is and why it works, it
doesn’t mean much.

If you find this distinction between product and value to be a bit subtle,
then here’s a cool little ChatGPT exercise for you.

Give it this prompt:

“I have a _[insert category]_ business. One difference we have with our
competitors is _[insert your product difference]_. Please give me 5 potential
forms of value that difference might yield for our customers.”

It will give you a pretty solid answer, which should quickly tune you in to
the difference between product and value. This isn’t to say any of the things
it says will be good ideas, or readymade strategies, but it’ll get you
thinking in the right direction.

So in conclusion, whenever you find yourself “justing”, take a beat. Because
you might be right. You might well be looking at something which is just a
convoluted version of something you already know.

But then again, you might not. And there might be something you need to learn
right there.
