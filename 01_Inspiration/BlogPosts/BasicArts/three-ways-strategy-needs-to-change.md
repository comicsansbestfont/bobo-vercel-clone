Last week, I shared my breakthrough.

I realised there are these dynamite principles every founder should know… but
they’ve been locked away—hidden in academia and billion-dollar consulting
firms.

These are the principles of business strategy. The ones almost every business
breaks because they don’t know any better.

My goal? Change that.

I want to:

  * Show founders what they’re missing
  * Make it quick and digestible
  * Hand them the tools to apply it FAST

Do that, and you can accelerate growth, outpace the competition, and build a
business that actually matters.

But here’s the thing—to do it, strategy needs a major overhaul. So here are
three key changes I’m bringing to the table:

## 1\. Make it Simple.

Why is strategy so bloated and complex? Because to be totally accurate, it has
to be. There are endless possible subtleties and permutations to explore.

But guess what?

99% of founders don’t need to know that stuff. The greats didn’t. And neither
do you.

Truth is there are a handful of strategic ideas that do 90% of the heavy
lifting. Master them, and you’re already ahead of pretty much _everyone_ else.

These are the things that will help you deliver _massive_ value that customers
can’t get anywhere else. Achieve that? The rest is noise.

**_What I’ve done:_** My program, The Strategy Shortcut System, is built
around just 5 strategy secrets. Learn them, internalise them—and boom—you’ll
be thinking like the top 1%.

## 2\. Make it Backwards.

The standard approach to strategy is like this:

  * Research customers
  * Study trends
  * Analyse the data
  * Look for opportunities

Sure, that makes sense. But it’s not the best way.

Here’s why:

  1. It’s expensive and time-consuming (great for companies with deep pockets, not for you).
  2. You might not find _anything_ useful.
  3. It’s what EVERYONE is doing.

When you ask the same questions, you get the same answers. So even if they’re
the right questions, you lose!

This is why I do it _backwards_. Start by identifying how you can offer
something different— _then_ map that onto customer needs. It’s faster,
cheaper, and way more fun.

**_What I’ve done:_** The Strategy Shortcut System is built on finding your
strategic sacrifice—the one killer move that will let you see possibilities
nobody else has dreamt of.

## 3\. Make it Practical.

Here’s the biggest problem with strategy:

“What the hell do I actually _make_?”

What’s the thing? The tool? The output I’m going to use.

Most people talk about strategy like it’s some abstract, magical thing. So I
wanted to make it something very concrete, that you can hold in your hand,
give to your team, and do stuff with.

**_What I’ve done:_** In the System, I believe I’ve built the most direct,
practical, and foolproof strategy document template known to man. Fill it out,
and you’ll have a clear roadmap to win—and so will your team.
