It must be nice to be a dentist.

They are an example of what we might call a “downside industry”, whereby
people hire them not so much to achieve something good, as to avoid something
bad. Downside industries don’t have to sell you an exciting or aspirational
future; they simply have to scare you about the horrible things that will
happen if you _don’t_ buy their wares.

Like the mafia and the IT department, dentists are lucky in this regard,
because selling the downside is much easier than selling the upside. “Pay to
get this” is a limper message than “pay to avoid this”, since, as we know, the
pain of loss is said to be twice as powerful as the pleasure of gain.

Bearing this in mind, I think it’s high time I took a break from preaching the
benefits of strategy, and tried a more negative approach. Forget the dream,
let’s talk about the nightmare:

## What bad things happen to businesses that neglect brand strategy?

_(Strategy defined as a clear and unique market role, which competitors can’t
fulfil)_

The following problems are a selection that will, _without exception_ , arise
for brands weak in this area. I’ve written about some of them before, so here
I am merely compiling them into one place.

You will notice that bankruptcy is not among them. That is because, as I’ve
said many times, strategy is not necessary for financial success. You can fall
ass-backwards into growth – and many brands do. But even if that’s the case,
these chronic problems will remain; causing perpetual headaches and holding
your business back from the far greater potential that lies within.

So let’s get to it. What are the consequences of poor strategy?

#### **Consequence 1 – You will become more and more similar to your
competitors**

The broadest result of not having a [business
strategy](https://basicarts.org/appreciating-scale-what-to-do-with-things-you-
cant-control/) will always simply be an inability to distinguish yourself from
other brands in your category. In the absence of a strong alternative path,
you will always be left following the one laid by others – thus drawing you
into direct conflict as you battle over who gets to own the space you all
desire. This battle will generally be fought in three ways, 1) by lowering
prices, 2) by splurging on marketing, and 3) by mirroring features – a
combination of tactics which adds up to commodification when stretched over
time. By and by, you and your competitors become increasingly similar, until
consumers cease to have a particular preference – which leads to…

#### **Consequence 2 – You will be at the mercy of the big guy**

Not every businesses wants to avoid clustering and commodification; in fact
for some it’s their whole model. Large conglomerates thrive on this dynamic,
as it plays directly to their strengths: scale and cash. By virtue of being
able to cut prices the lowest, and spend the most on marketing, they will
often be able to edge out smaller competitors – taking the consumer’s
indifference to the category and weaponising it. Arguably such businesses
would _rather_ have commodified brands in their portfolio than unique ones.
Why? Because the risk is lower. A commodified proposition is market-tested,
whereas a strategic one is a gamble. Sadly most businesses don’t have this
luxury.

#### **Consequence 3 – You won’t know what to do next, and will waste time
spinning your wheels**

With a tight and focused strategy, you have a way to evaluate which projects
will work for you and which won’t _ahead of time_. It’s like being able to
tell the future. If an idea is on-strategy then it will fit with the overall
picture, and lead to growth – and if it’s off-strategy then it won’t.
Naturally, this is pretty useful when it comes to idea generation, decision
making, and efficient allocation of resources. If you’re like most businesses,
however, and you don’t have a strategy that acts as such a filter, then the
suitability of various ideas and projects descends to rank guesswork. Does
this fit with what we’re about? Will this work? Will this lead to growth? Who
knows – better just give it a go and find out. Such reactive and experimental
behaviour is to be encouraged in the early years of a business when it’s still
figuring out its position. But eventually, you want to move beyond such
“hustle”, because it’s exhausting and expensive – progressing by stops and
starts, with no real destination in mind. It does work (sort of), but it isn’t
pretty.

#### **Consequence 4 – Your growth will hit a wall**

Every product, when launched, has what I call a “natural market size”. This
means there is a certain latent appetite for it, which it will grow to fulfil,
but no more. It might be huge, it might be zero – there is no real way to know
other than putting it out there, and seeing where it gets to. The problem this
creates for a lot of businesses is that one day, suddenly, growth will stop –
and probably earlier than you’d like. In the absence of a strategy, these
businesses are left with no way to grow beyond the _inherent potential_ of
their product – whether that’s by tweaking the product itself, launching new
products, or recontextualising the product for a wider market. A strong
strategy allows you to stretch the market potential of a product, and the
wider business that produces it – perhaps without limit.

#### **Consequence 5 – You will be boring**

Businesses without focused strategies must, by definition, hedge their bets.
They cannot attack any one direction too purposefully, because such singular
commitment would, of course, represent a strategy – and so instead they will
carefully endeavour to cover their bases; to do a little bit of everything, so
they don’t get caught out. Such fence-sitting brands are, of course, intensely
boring. By mixing together the colours of different vibrant strategies, they
become a generic brown sludge – distinguishable in no particular way at all.
It is only the strategically committed that are capable of bold action; and so
it is only the strategically committed that are capable of being interesting.

#### **Consequence 6 – You will be subservient to agencies and advisers**

I used to work in a marketing agency, and I can boil down pretty much every
brief from clients into one question “what are we for?”. They were at a loss,
unsure as to how to convince people to buy this random thing they
manufactured. Although the client was the one with the money, the agency was
the one with the power. This dynamic only arises if a business is unsure of
its strategy. Businesses with fixed strategies don’t outsource questions like
this because they know the answer already. Of course, they may still work with
external partners for executional purposes – much as you may hire a plumber or
electrician – but they won’t outsource their very identity; let alone allow it
to be changed every couple of years when new people with their own ideas get
involved. Great brands use agencies not as gurus, but as messenger boys:
because the message is settled, and there’s nothing left to do but deliver it.

#### **Consequence 7 – You will struggle to lead**

A lack of strategy not only effects your ability to grow your sales; it also
effects your ability to grow your headcount. Every business starts its life as
an autocracy, with a founder who has absolute power, and makes every decision.
For a time this works pretty well, because it means that decisions are
generally quite consistent, all coming from the same source. However
eventually the time will come when the founder can no longer micro-manage the
whole show – either because the business has grown too large, or because the
business has been bought and new management is in charge. In this scenario
many brands run into serious problems, as there is no central guidance around
which to base decisions. A strategy solves this, _since it effectively
replaces the founder as the boss_. Leadership is no longer based on the whims
of one individual, but rather a consistent blueprint that covers the whole
enterprise. Businesses with such a blueprint can reach vast sizes while
maintaining the operational efficiency of a startup. The hard choices have
been made up front – all that’s left is to adhere to them.

So there you have it. Just as a healthy body can be defined as one with an
absence of ailments, so too can a healthy business be described as one which
lacks these issues. Strip them away and all that’s left is a pure vision of
what a business should be:

A vehicle for giving value to the world, and collecting value in return.
