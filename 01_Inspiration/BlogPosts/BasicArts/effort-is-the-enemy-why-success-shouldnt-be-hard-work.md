Success and effort, we’re assured, are inextricably linked. There is no
success without effort, and (short of some cruel misfortune) there is no
effort without success.

You want something? Then put your back into it. Starting a business? Be
prepared to work 20 hour days. This narrative – that sweat is the currency
that buys success – is woven deep into our cultural psyche. It’s a narrative
that glorifies hard work, and makes it something to be proud of, even to boast
about.

But that’s not quite how things work.

Far from being a virtue, in many cases hard effort is a _consequence of a
flawed approach_ – and furthermore can be extremely damaging and corrosive to
you and the world around you if persisted with.

The truth is that lots successes, in every walk of life, actually emerge quite
effortlessly. Yes, they might take time and energy, but that time and energy
will not be interpreted as a struggle, or as anything like hard work. It will
instead feel like a seemingly effortless flow, where everything clicks
together just right, and the outcome emerges almost of its own accord; like it
was meant to be.

Such easy successes aren’t fluke, or even the exceptions – they are instead
the result of good strategy: where the actions taken are perfectly fitted to
the system in which they occur. Like a round peg (your action) fitting into a
round hole (the context).

For a very basic example, if you want to get in shape, and find a method which
matches your tastes and resources, then the process will be pretty easy – even
enjoyable. But if you force yourself to do something you can’t stand, the
likelihood of success drops to near zero, and the feeling of effort increases
dramatically.

When graft emerges like this, it is a _signal_ that there is a mismatch
between your actions and the situation – a square peg into a round hole as it
were. In such scenarios brute force is required to make something succeed in
spite of its bad strategy – and therefore such effort shouldn’t be celebrated;
it should be taken as a warning that you are on the wrong path.

Thinking about this in the context of business, if things feel difficult, that
shouldn’t be taken as an invitation to “work harder” – quite the opposite. It
should instead be taken as a sign that the market doesn’t value what you are
offering. Typically this will mean one of two things:

1- Your idea is a bad idea, meaning that the market doesn’t want it, and
therefore won’t pick it up and elevate it

2- Your idea is a duplicate of existing ideas, providing a value that already
exists in the market, which is simply another way of failing to add value

In other words, you business has a poor market fit.

Now businesses like this aren’t necessarily doomed to failure, but they will
have to apply _brute force_ to succeed. For example I remember earlier in my
career working with a large corporate who wanted to enter a particular
category which was in growth. To do this, rather than thinking of a way they
could add new value to the market and diversify it, they produced a product
which was completely generic and provided no incremental value whatsoever.
Would a product like this be able to succeed effortlessly? Certainly not – and
that’s why they had to spend more than £100 million on marketing and retailer
incentives in order to _force_ the product into the market. Money, naturally,
is a unit of effort – so this was their equivalent of an entrepreneur working
day and night to force a bad idea.

Needless to say if their idea had been well fitted to the market – a round peg
in a round hole – far less effort would have been required.

For an example of that, look at the emergence of Halo Top, the low calorie ice
cream brand. After a few years of largely unsuccessful experimentation, they
eventually managed to get things correctly aligned resulting in a sudden
_unexpected_ 2,500% growth in 2016 – on the path to becoming the number 1 ice
cream in the USA. As their founder observed, “From there it seemed to take on
a life of its own. It grew quickly and it very much shocked us”.

“Shocking ease” like this is the consequence of [strategic
wisdom](https://basicarts.org/how-to-take-your-thinking-to-a-new-level-
literally/) and alignment of action with situation – of “system fit”.

Ease is not the only reason to avoid effort. It’s also important to do so
because effort can be extremely destructive – to you and to other parties.

The only way you can force something to succeed which can’t succeed of its own
accord is, in essence, to “break the system”; making it in some way less
healthy in order to accommodate your bad idea.

In the case of the nameless corporation I mentioned earlier, their success (if
you can call it that), came at the expense of that market. They lowered the
quality and variety of options on offer to consumers and encouraged the
pathologies of paying for listings and permanent deep-discounting. This kind
of “crony corporatism” is bad for brands and customers, as well as being
extremely costly for the guilty party – all of which could have been avoided
if a good strategy had been in place.

Ultimately your job is to be like water, effortlessly flowing down a
mountainside by following the contours of the land – rather than bulldozing it
in order to plot a path of your choosing.

If you’re finding it tough, finding it a struggle, don’t interpret it as some
noble rite of passage, the hero’s journey, or – worst of all – “hustle”.
Instead see it for what it is: a sign. A sign you are following the wrong
path.

Because for the most part, when something’s right it just comes. Maybe not
quickly, but certainly pleasantly and fluidly – and in a manner that will
enrich both you and those your idea touches.
