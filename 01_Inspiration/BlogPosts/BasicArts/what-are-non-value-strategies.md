My definition of business strategy – which runs through all these pieces like
a thread – is simple:

**It’s the unique value the business seeks to bring to the market.**

Businesses are nothing more than vehicles for value exchange, therefore it
stands to reason that if you maximise the value you give, you’ll maximise the
value you take. That’s the whole story really, everything else is just
details. Use this definition and you won’t go far wrong.

Still, simple though it is, it is also technically wrong. The true “textbook”
definition of strategy is much wider than that, something more along the lines
of:

**The path you’re going to take to achieve your goal.**

The main reason I don’t use this definition is because it’s so broad and wooly
that it’s almost meaningless. It’s another way of saying “you could do
anything to achieve anything”. Where do you even begin with that? By drilling
down to something specific and directional, as the first definition does, we
take a practical first step, rather than getting lost in abstractions.

Nevertheless, I must acknowledge that by adopting this narrower framing of
strategy, we are actually excluding many legitimate strategies a business
might adopt; strategies I call “non-value strategies” because, obviously, they
get their leverage from something other than delivering value.

Let me give you an example.

The Mars corporation, through various clever means, found a way to make
chocolate bars far more cheaply than their competitors. Rather than doing the
obvious with this – selling their product more cheaply – they instead chose to
sell at the same price as everyone else, and use the extra margin to buy shelf
space from retailers. When you see a Mars product in a store, chances are that
either today or in the past they bought that presence, rather than landing
there “organically”.

I actually experienced this directly with one of my clients, Eat Natural. The
most physically similar of their competitors were KIND, an American brand
which had been bought by Mars and exported to the UK. Although Eat Natural had
a higher rate of sale than KIND (which would normally allow it to command the
superior shelf position), Mars paid retailers to give them better listings.
This was smart of course, because in time that shelf position had the
potential to embed the product in consumer consciousness, ultimately resulting
in the product being able to hold that space on its own.

_(I should add that Mars are by no means the only brand who play this game,
but as I understand things it is a historic strategy of theirs that has served
them well for decades)_

As you can see then, this is a classic “non-value strategy”, because it is
totally unrelated to the value they are bringing to the consumer – or even the
retailer frankly, since “paying someone to buy you” is not a sustainable long
term position.

Non-value strategies like this are extremely common – especially, I would
suggest, in the more old school mega-corporate world, where scale and
complexity allows organisations to uncover hidden efficiencies, and leverage
influence. It would be foolish to assume that all the successful products and
services you come across have achieved that status by being “the best”; of
course they haven’t. There are many other ways to play the game.

Considering this, we might ask why I don’t advocate more for non-value
strategies, since they can be extremely effective?

There are three reasons for this

**_1 – UNIVERSALITY_**

The vast majority of businesses simply don’t have a viable non-value strategy
at their disposal. Speaking broadly, such strategies are typically only
accessible to large corporates. Sure, in some cases smaller businesses will
have some sort of non-value leverage to call upon – for example the use of a
proprietary technology, having a celebrity founder, or something random like
that. But mostly they won’t.

By contrast every business –  _including those using non-value strategies_ –
must have some sort of value strategy. Mars’ game of buying shelf space
wouldn’t work if nobody liked their products. Tony Soprano’s waste management
company may be able to call on the extremely effective non-value strategy of
whacking their competitors – however even that wouldn’t work if they didn’t at
least manage  _some_ waste.

Sure, a business with a good non-value strategy can get away with pretty
shoddy value provision. But clearly they’d be better off if they addressed
that side of the equation too. Therefore, since every business needs to
deliver value to  _some_ degree, it’s a good place to start.

**_2 – EASE_**

The second issue with non-value strategies is that that they are extremely
difficult to arrive at methodically. They start from the broad definition of
strategy – “anything we can do to achieve a goal” – and as such leave us
floundering for a place to begin.

For this reason I’d suggest that non-value strategies are generally stumbled
upon or post-rationalised, rather than being “engineered” in a deliberate
manner. Businesses recognise that they have a particular ace up their sleeve,
and deploy it, rather than “coming up with” that ace in a strategic
development exercise.

You couldn’t simply decide to copy the Mars strategy, since it’s predicated on
a manufacturing advantage that you can’t will into existence. Instead you have
to have the manufacturing advantage in the first place, and  _then_ leverage
it – a back to front process that their are no rules for.

Certainly if I was giving strategy advice to the board of General Electric or
whoever I’d be on the alert for these opportunities, as they’d almost
certainly be there. And equally if I stumbled across them randomly with a
smaller brand then we’d use them too. But what you can’t really do is develop
them out of thin air – whereas with value strategies you pretty much can.

**_3 – EFFECTIVENESS_**

Finally, although this is dependent on the example at hand, I’d generally say
that value strategies are simply more effective.

Non-value strategies are often little more than glorified “hacks” to success,
which are extremely dependent on some weird and likely  _non-permanent_
condition. A sudden shift in circumstances and –  _poof!_ – the advantage is
gone.

Good  _value_ strategies, by contrast, can be reasonably timeless.

Part of the reason for this is that  _value strategies are deeply entwined
with and protected by**brand**_. Brand, as we know, is essentially the vehicle
through which value is communicated, and by which a business builds a given
reputation in its market. This reputation is robust to change. Let’s say
another brand comes along which provides the same value, as good or maybe even
better than you. Assuming you’ve built the  _reputation_ for this value, that
doesn’t really matter, as your position is basically “locked in”. The newbie
will struggle to gain traction. Apple haven’t really had a “tangible”
strategic advantage for years, but their brand lets them hold position
regardless.

How about if market circumstances change, and your product is suddenly no
longer fit for purpose? Again, your brand reputation protects you, allowing
you to develop a new product that  _continues_ to offer the strategic value in
the new context, without skipping a beat.

Non-value strategies, by contrast, have no brand connection to protect them.
Consumers are totally unaware of them. When their leverage disappears, the
strategy vanishes completely, leaving the business totally exposed and
floundering.

This is why the most switched-on megacorps – like P&G and Apple – deliberately
force themselves to put consumer value at the heart of their strategies. Could
they get away without doing this? Of course they could. Would it be easier?
Probably. But they’d be  _vulnerable_. Vulnerable to ending up like the many
non-value focused corporations who fell on hard times despite their once
unassailable market positions (e.g. General Motors).

In conclusion, although non-value strategies are a huge part of the strategic
field, we serve ourselves best by seeing them as a “bonus” – something to be
jumped upon if they fall into our laps, but not worried too much about
otherwise.

They are not true alternatives to value strategies, which to me are
fundamental, and non-negotiable.
