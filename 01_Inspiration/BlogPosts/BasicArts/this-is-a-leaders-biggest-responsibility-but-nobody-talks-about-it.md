There’s a simple exercise that you’ve just got to try.

Not only try in fact; you must make it a ritual. Every year, or half year
even, you should be doing this, recording the results – and, hopefully, the
progress.

It will tell you more about the strength of your organisation’s strategy (and
thus its general strength) than any other metric short of profit.

Here it is:

**1.** Schedule a short meeting with each member of your team individually. If
you run a large organisation with thousands of employees, choose a selection
from across the board – janitor to marketing director.

**2.** Sit them down, and ask them this simple question: “What are we trying
to give people with this business? What is our focus?”.

**3.** Note their answers.

**4.** And when complete, compare.

What do you find?

Is there a pattern? Is there a theme? Are the answers the same? Or all over
the place? Do they even understand the question? Are they even able to answer
it _at all_?

(I’d suggest the most likely thing you’ll find is fear, confusion, and
silence).

Now it’s clear what I’m driving at here. That question is obviously a proxy
for “what is our strategy?”, just phrased in more accessible manner. And the
level of alignment and understanding across the business is a measure of how
much this strategy actually _exists_.

You might _think_ you have a strategy, but if your team can’t spit it out
instinctively without a second thought then you don’t. Not in a way that
matters.

This is a fairly subtle point, so it’s worth a bit of elaboration. Many
leaders (and low level employees) believe implicitly that strategy is
something that exists “up there”, in the boardroom, and isn’t really a concern
of the worker drones going about their day-to-day tasks. But clearly this is
nonsense, as the actual _delivery_ of a strategy is accomplished by the
alignment of a thousand _tiny_ decisions, made by ordinary employees, every
day, stretched over time.

Every email.  
Every meeting.  
Every problem fix.  
Every stroke of a pen.  
Every turn of a screw.

Everything is to some extent suffused with assumptions about what the business
is trying to do. _What the point of all this is_.

And so it is all suffused by strategy.

The greatest brands then are simply those whose every move has complete
coherence and alignment, because _everybody_ knows what the game is. They
might be only _one_ square of a 5,000 piece jigsaw puzzle. But they know what
picture they’re making.

When you stop and think about it, the fact that pretty much every business on
the planet would fail this test miserably is _insane_. Like you almost think
“how can they even _operate_?”.

But they can.

Just haphazardly, reactively, and relatively unprofitably.

**So what do we do about this?**

Look, obviously one part of the solution here is to actually have a strategy.
That goes without saying, so I’m not going to labour that point.

No, instead I want to focus on something a bit more interesting, which is
this:

**It is the responsibility of every leader to be a propagandist.**

Your job isn’t “management”. Or “decision making”. Or “troubleshooting”.
That’s not what it means to be a strategic leader. No, your job is to be a
sloganeer. To be a brainwasher. To repeat yourself – passionately, and
endlessly – so nobody forgets what’s really going on here.

This is what the great CEOs _do_.

It’s their _job_.

They stand up in front of their teams, their investors, their customers, the
press – and they repeat themselves. They say the same shit over and over again
like a mantra, until it’s so embedded in the existential understanding of the
business that it _is_ the business.

Why do you think there are so many videos of Steve Jobs making the same basic
points over and over?

**Because he was doing propaganda.**

Why do you think Jeff Bezos has gone to the tedious trouble of repeating his
schtick about being “customer centric” in literally _thousands_ of emails and
memos?

**Because he’s doing propaganda.**

Why does Elon Musk have this thing called “the algorithm”, which obsessively
outlines his management and manufacturing philosophy?

**Because it’s propaganda.**

Propaganda is their responsibility – and they know it. And therefore, the
crucial things they want everyone to understand? Well, they know them too.

If your main activity every day isn’t repeating yourself, then, I would
suggest, you are not leading, and furthermore you probably don’t have a great
strategy either.

Because that’s the thing about strategy – _real_ strategy – it demands
repetition. It’s irresistible. It becomes an idea you fall in love with; which
you get pleasure out of re-articulating again and again and again.

I don’t think those guys repeated themselves because they read some blog like
this and thought “oh, I’d better keep talking about my strategy”. No, they
repeated themselves because they couldn’t help it. They repeated themselves
because they were in love.

• And until you fall in love with a strategy like this, you won’t repeat
yourself.  
• And until you repeat yourself, your business won’t be aligned.  
• And until your business is aligned, you won’t create anything with singular
greatness.

So start with the test at the top of this piece. Start by identifying the size
of the problem; the woolliness and incoherence within your business today.

And then start brainwashing. And if you don’t enjoy the process, if you don’t
enjoy the brainwashing, if it doesn’t spill forth naturally – _then_ start
strategising.

And keep going until you have an idea can’t shut up about.
