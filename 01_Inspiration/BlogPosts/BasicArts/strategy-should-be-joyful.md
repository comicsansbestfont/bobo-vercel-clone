Somewhere along the way, business has acquired an unwritten rule that goes
something like this:

**Creativity and artistry are only to be applied in the media elements of
company, specifically its advertising and branding.**

Advertising and branding, the external media “dressing” of a business, are the
acceptable canvas for fun, playful, exuberant, emotional creative thinking,
whilst the rest of the business, “the real business”, is not. No, the real
business is the preserve of the “grown ups”. It is rational, it is evidence-
based, it is mechanistic, and yes, it is boring too.

This “boringness” that rules the foundational elements of business is, we’re
led to believe, somehow necessary and noble. It’s what good business looks
like, even  _feels_ like. We’d never admit it out loud, but I think we all
secretly believe that the dull solution is probably the best solution; that
the deck with more slides and more charts provides the truer analysis; and
that technical mindset should always take precedence over the imaginative.

Now there are certainly elements of truth in this philosophy. Certain parts of
business management are necessarily rigid and technical no matter which way
you cut them. “Creative bookkeeping” generally denotes fraud rather than an
exciting new way of doing things.

However it seems to me that we allow this dryness to saturate not just
isolated subsets of business, but rather the whole damn thing.

This is certainly the case with strategy, which on the whole is not a fun,
imaginative, and creative discipline but rather one of jargon-riddled academic
rigour. To see what I mean just imagine what a typical “strategist” looks
like, or “strategic consultancy” or “strategic process”. Doesn’t exactly get
the blood flowing does it?

So why is this the case? Why is “proper” business so damn serious?

I think the obvious explanation is that we believe that the dry and technical
are somehow “scientific” and thus “true”. We believe that a decision based on
rigorous analysis is more likely to be on the money than one based on
opinionated insight. At a subconscious level we probably even conflate the
grey suit of the consultant with the white coat of the scientist. We feel that
the incomprehensibility of a paper on nuclear physics marks it out as
“superior” information, so we wish to see something similar mirrored in our
companies.

**“If I don’t get it, and find it boring, then it must be right!”.**

But in truth this is simply a case of the emperor’s new clothes.

Business is  _not_ science. There is not a “right” solution in the same way
there is for a maths problem. There is no amount of analysis that will deliver
you certainty. Business, like human life in general, is an open problem,
subject to levels of unpredictability and chaos that are beyond reductive
mastery. Decisions – even the most sophisticated and expensive ones – are only
ever punts. They are only ever  _opinions_ , no matter how grey and un-
opinionated you make them sound.

Considering this, why shouldn’t we allow a bit of fun into the decision making
process?

This is my pitch to you. Business in general, but more specifically strategy,
should not only be smart, but  _joyful_. It should be amusing. It should be
surprising. It should be subjective. Strategies should hang on divergent ways
of seeing the world; on ideas that make you gasp, or laugh. They should be
exciting to execute. They should make you go “fuck yeah” rather than “yes that
appears to be prudent”.

In the downstream world of advertising (say), this kind of provocative
thinking is allowed (although even there it’s increasingly under threat). This
is because advertising is seen as 1) harmless, and 2) at least partially
irrational.

Well guess what?  _The whole thing is irrational_.

The whole thing is a giant experiment that relies, unavoidably, on
interactions with human beings who will stubbornly refuse to behave like
flawless economic actors.

This means that great business by definition has irrationality – joy, fear,
humour, whatever – baked in at its very core.

Don’t believe me? Then take a minute to think about Elon Musk.

_(NB yes, I get that everyone hates him now, but I’m just trying to illustrate
a point, so for the purposes of this essay please humour me)_

Why exactly is this guy the world’s most successful entrepreneur? Is it
because he does’t make mistakes? Is it because he has superior analytical
skills which enable him to always be “right”? Clearly not – just look at the
way he’s currently slipping and sliding around Twitter. No, the only truly
remarkable thing about Musk, the only thing that obviously makes him stand out
from other business leaders is this:

**He’s having a good time.**

He’s making decisions via a blend of analysis and give-a-fuck intuition.
Tesla, when all’s said and done, was hardly the world’s first electric car
brand – but it was the first car brand to install random features purely
because the founder thought they were cool. Another of his ventures, an
infrastructure and tunnelling company is called The Boring Company – because
why not? They even sold a flamethrower for some reason I’m not quite sure
about. And that’s before we even get on to the SpaceX stuff.

Understand, I’m not trying to say here that all business should be “jokey”.
These are just very blunt examples to make the point. What I am trying to say
however is that all business should be  _creative_. It should fire the
imagination from its very core. And that means allowing a degree of human
artistry and intuition into the fundamental decision making process; into the
strategy.

_(Steve Jobs, incidentally, while being stylistically very different from
Musk, was just the same in this respect)_

When I write a strategy for a client, I always try at the bare minimum to make
it  _interesting_. This isn’t just because my clients are human beings, and
human beings like interesting stuff (although that would be reason enough).
No, it’s because interesting strategies build interesting companies. And
interesting companies attract customers, and are fun to work for.

We’re all capable of asking “is this decision right?”, that’s the easy part,
and I don’t want to dismiss it. But how many brands also ask “is it
interesting?”. “Is it exciting?”. Not many.

So consider this my manifesto then.

I accept that good strategy doesn’t have to be this way. And I accept that
good business doesn’t have to be this way either. This is ultimately just my
opinion.

But damn it, it’s the way I want to work. And between you and I, if you really
want to bow completely to the rational, I think it delivers stronger results
too.
