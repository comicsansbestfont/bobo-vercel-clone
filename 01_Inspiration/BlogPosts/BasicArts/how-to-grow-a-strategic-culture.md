What do you look for in a new hire?

Immediately no doubt all the cliches come to mind. Hardworking, team player,
problem solver, etc. Cliches are quite helpful like that: by on the tip of our
tongue, they guide us effortlessly to good solid solutions. Solutions that
have been tried and tested enough to become cliches. In most walks of life,
you won’t go far wrong doing what’s cliched, and I would venture that hiring
is no exception.

Sometimes, however, this can backfire. Sometimes the cliches can lead you
astray, and carry unintended consequences which hold you back in subtle,
insidious ways.

**And there is one such trap lurking in the way we build our teams: a focus on
problem-solving.**

This idea was introduced to me by a mentor of mine, Andy Bass, in his [great
new book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Start-What-Works-Andy-
Bass/dp/1292341114/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2UC2DBBSPJ5D&dchild=1&keywords=start+with+what+works&qid=1624981188&sprefix=start+with+what+%2Caps%2C174&sr=8-3).
At first, it sounds pretty counterintuitive. Why would it be bad to stock your
organisation with great problem solvers? Why might it be harmful to encourage
problem-solving, and to embed it deep in our cultures and ways of working?
Well, clearly there’s nothing wrong with problem-solving per se. Naturally, it
will often come in very handy.

The issue is where it draws the organisation’s focus: namely, to problems.

Most teams operate primarily as problem-solving machines; directly their
attention to the problem du jour, fixing it, and awaiting the next problem.
This is dangerous because, as Andy says, “the hidden assumption is that
yesterday’s standard is the gold standard”. Everyone is focused, implicitly,
on “getting things back to normal”. Now perhaps in some very large and mature
organisations this is appropriate. If you’re a drone in the bowels of General
Electric or Coca-Cola, your primary goal is to perpetuate the smooth running
of the machine. That’s fair enough. But most organisations aren’t like that.
Most organisations need relatively rapid innovation and change in order to
stimulate growth, and a problem-focused mindset doesn’t help that – in fact,
it hurts it.

**What most companies require instead is the opposite. Not “problem creation”
(obviously), but rather _a focus on what’s working_ , instead of what isn’t.**

When you direct your attention to what’s working – to understanding it,
unpacking it, and finding more of it – you don’t simply perpetuate the status
quo, you improve it. This may sound like a facile point, but when you think
about it how much attention in your organisation is given to what’s going
well? Five percent maybe? Far more typical is to take the attributes of a
business for granted, and to almost forget about them altogether.

This is where a lot of the value I offer in my own [strategic
projects](https://basicarts.org/glossary-of-strategic-ideas-volume-1/) comes
in. A big chunk of what I do is basically going into businesses, observing
what’s going right, and doubling down on it. This is the better part of
strategy frankly. Pretty simple you may think, only most organisations have
_no idea_ what these things are. They can write you an eloquent thesis on what
_isn’t_ working, that’s for sure. But when it comes to the unique points of
strength the business has, their knowledge is usually restricted to vague and
generic platitudes.

“Oh we have a good quality product”  
“We have a nice brand”  
“We offer great service”  
“We have a good sales team”

Maybe so – but utterly lacking in penetrative thought.

All in all, I think it’s fair to say that a big contributor to this is the
problem-solving mindset. Un-strategic organisations direct their attention to
what’s not working. Strategic organisations direct their attention to what is,
and figure out how to amplify it. (Hence why Andy’s book is called Start With
What Works).

Returning to the idea of helpful cliches I mentioned before, you will notice
there is no pithy phrase to describe this behaviour. There is no upside-
focused equivalent of “problem solver”. We could make one up – like “asset
maximiser” (ugh) – but you’re never going to find it written on a CV.

Without this nomenclature, organisations will continue to be drawn into the
murky world of problems, and [strategic
thinking](https://basicarts.org/newsletter/) will continue to be a rarified
resource.

From my perspective, long may that continue. But from yours, maybe it’s
something to change. Next time you’re hiring, don’t ask them to tell you about
a crisis they averted, or an issue they fixed. Ask them about a strength they
maximised. An attribute they noticed and amplified.

It won’t come naturally to you or them, but that’s the cultural root of a
strategic organisation.
