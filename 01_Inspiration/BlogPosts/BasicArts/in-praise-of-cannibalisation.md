Hindsight, as we know, is a wonderful thing. Looking back on the great
business failures of our time, the likes of Blockbuster and Kodak, and none of
us believe that we would have made the same fatal errors of judgement. How
could we? Their mistakes were so glaring that surely they would have been
obvious before the fact, never mind after it. And yet they made them anyway –
and so too would most of us in their position. Why? The enduring appeal of the
most destructive idea in business: that “cannibalisation” is a bad thing.

In case you don’t know (and therefore must be expecting something very weird
from this article), cannibalisation is the phenomenon where a company launches
a new product which in some way erodes the sales of one of their existing
products. Fear of this eventuality is frequently used as the “strategic”
rationale for either hobbling new products, or killing them altogether.

Unsurprisingly given the nomenclature, you never hear the term used in a
positive way. But that’s precisely what I want to do here, by proposing that
not only is cannibalisation nothing to fear – it’s actually something to be
sought and celebrated.

To explain why this is, we need to draw a line between the two different kinds
of cannibalisation that a business can “suffer” – fragmentation and
unification.

Fragmentation cannibalisation is the more common variety, and it occurs when a
business _increases_ its range of products, spreading its sales across them. A
classic example of this would be the launch of Diet Coke, whereby Coca-Cola
launched a new product whose utility overlapped with their existing product.
Inevitably some regular Coke drinkers would prefer the new offering.

The benefits of this type of cannibalisation are so obvious that it feels
almost embarrassing to explain them – I mean, who out there thinks that the
launch of Diet Coke was a strategic misstep? – and yet businesses constantly
nip similar products in the bud, so let’s dwell on them for a moment.

The fear of executives in this scenario is that if product A (their existing
product) currently makes £100 of sales, then product B (their new product)
might “steal” £30 of those sales, decreasing the sales of product A to £70.
OK, fine, that may happen – but the business as a whole still has total sales
of £100, so who cares how they are distributed across the range? And that of
course is the worst case scenario. It’s far more likely that product B will
have been created to bring new people into the brand, people who didn’t like
product A, so in addition to the £30 of sales it “steals”, it may also bring
in £20 of entirely new sales. The ultimate result is £120 of sales, and 20%
growth across the whole business.

Like I said, pretty obvious.

Less obvious is the case for unification cannibalisation. Unification
cannibalisation occurs when a business _unifies_ its range of products, for
instance perhaps selling two products and realising that it can improve one of
them to such a point as to make the other redundant. A classic example of this
dynamic could be seen between the iPhone and the iPod. The music capabilities
of the iPhone essentially made the iPod unnecessary, more or less killing the
latter product as it was absorbed into the former.

In a scenario like this you can at least make the case that, unlike with
fragmentation cannibalisation, the business may end up with less sales
overall. Clearly it would be better for Apple if everyone bought an iPhone and
an iPod – not just one or the other. But this would not be a sound argument to
deprive the iPhone of musical capabilities, because the market would swiftly
punish such anti-consumer manoeuvring. Other manufacturers would be only too
willing to remedy the flaw you so cynically engineered, thus ensuring that you
still lose sales, only in this case to someone else.

This ultimately demonstrates the necessity of cannibalising your own products
– it is the ultimate hedge against disruption. If you have a product idea that
you genuinely fear will “eat” some of your current trade, then that simply
means you have a _good product idea_ ; one which someone else will gladly
activate if you don’t want to. A product range which can be cannibalised is
vulnerable, and so surely you want to be the ones to exploit your own
vulnerability?

It’s that or become like Blockbuster and Kodak – businesses who would rather
die than take a bite out of themselves. So turn a predatory eye to your own
products. Make plans to kill your darlings. And accept that all businesses
will be eaten sooner or later. The only question is by whom.
