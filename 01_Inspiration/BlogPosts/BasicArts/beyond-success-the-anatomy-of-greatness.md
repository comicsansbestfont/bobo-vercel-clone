Consider the gap represented by these comparisons:

HP vs. Apple  
James Milner vs. Eric Cantona  
Avatar vs. 2001: A Space Odyssey  
Wladimir Klitschko vs. Muhammad Ali

In each case, you have two things that are both incredibly successful, and yet
the latter examples possess a quality that the former – even if they’re more
successful on paper – simply don’t.

For a long time, I’ve grappled with that precisely this quality is, as it’s
something I try to push [my clients](https://basicarts.org/work-with-us/)
towards. Is it style? Cultural relevance? Idiosyncrasy? Yes, it’s all those
things, but alone they are insufficient. What we are really talking about here
is something broader:

_Greatness_.

That’s the best word I can think of. But what exactly is greatness?

It’s one of those slippery concepts which, like pornography, we struggle to
define but know when we see it. We know that certain athletes, certain movies,
certain military heroes, and of course certain companies are great simply by
intuition.

But intuition isn’t very useful if we are chasing greatness ourselves.

For that we need a definition that’s more concrete, more black and white. A
yardstick to measure ourselves by if we want to cross that divide.

One thing’s for sure, “greatness” isn’t simply an extreme version of
“success”. It doesn’t mean “very very successful”. In fact, success probably
isn’t even a necessary part of greatness.

When Mel Gibson’s William Wallace is being hung drawn and quartered at the end
of _Braveheart_ , the movie makes it pretty clear we’re witnessing “greatness”
– but it’s not exactly what most of us would call “success”. There is such
thing as glorious defeat, as well as inglorious victory.

No, greatness is its own separate metric. Perfectly compatible with success,
probably correlated in fact – but not the same.

I would argue that in all fields – from a great boxer to a great underwear
brand – there is one commonality that applies, and that is this:

_Going where others are afraid to follow._

All tales of heroism, all aspirational extremes, they all share this
characteristic. Somebody goes out there and does something which their peers
simply aren’t prepared to do. As observers, we know that if we were in their
shoes, we probably wouldn’t do it either. And this fills us with admiration.
Longing even. Longing to be associated with a courage that we deep down know
we lack.

I can remember being blown away by the story of Philippe Petit, the high-wire
artist who shocked the world by walking his tightrope between the Twin Towers
of the World Trade Centre in 1974.

What was amazing about his story wasn’t the feat itself. I mean it was
impressive, sure. Perhaps sufficient for greatness alone. But that wasn’t the
half of it. What propelled him into the stratosphere in my eyes was the fact
that his walk was completely unauthorised.

To accomplish it, he and his co-conspirators had to plot in secret; sneaking
into the buildings after dark like thieves, and setting up the wire while the
city slept below them. In order cast it between the towers, they were forced
to shoot a fishing line over the void using a bow and arrow. This line was
then tied to a thicker line, then a rope, then a thicker rope, and finally the
steel wire – which had to be dragged across by hand. At last, as day broke and
New Yorkers set about their morning commute, Petit was able to walk. As
helicopters hovered beside him and cops waited at either end of the wire to
make their arrest, he paused, lay down, and absorbed the moment.

Amongst all this, who gives a damn that the guy is a proficient tightrope
walker? His success at his craft means nothing in comparison to his flair and
guts. It means nothing in comparison to his _greatness_.

Defined this way, it’s little wonder that this quality is so rare. It is, by
its very nature, something aberrant.

Equally this definition makes it completely reasonable to _reject_ greatness.
To _not_ want it. If success can be achieved without it, why would you
jeopardise that in pursuit of something so nebulous and egotistical as glory?
Sure, greatness can come with certain material rewards – but on balance
they’re probably not worth the risk.

However, if such rationality doesn’t sway you, and you still hold ambitions of
reaching this higher threshold, then you know what you have to do. Get clear
on those things you will do that your peers will not. The things that put you
in danger.

Despite the rhetoric to the contrary, the internet age has ushered in an era
of extreme homogeneity and conformity. We are all swimming in the same
cultural soup, with fewer and fewer operating at the margins. Risk-taking and
visionary acts are more difficult now than they ever have been before. And
thus acts of greatness are an endangered species.

It’s hard to imagine someone doing what Petit did today, in 2020. It’s hard to
imagine someone even thinking of it. The 70s in particular, for some reason,
were a wild time, with as much greatness crammed into the average year as
we’ve experienced in the past decade.

But perhaps if we understand the _ingredients_ of such achievements, we can
bring them a little bit closer.
