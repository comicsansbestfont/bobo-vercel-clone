There’s a poisonous assumption you see in business, which goes something like
this:

**I’m the best, but the world’s unfair, so I don’t get the results I
deserve.**

I think we’re pretty much all guilty of it. Nobody ever admits that they are
where they are because they deserve to be. Nobody ever thinks the market is
judging them fairly. And sure-as-hell nobody ever thinks that perhaps they
might be performing _better_ than their abilities warrant.

Nope, everybody is a couple of clicks below where they “should” be if there
was any justice.

Funny that, eh?

I know this sense of unjustified injustice intimately, because I’ve long
thought it about myself.

I _should_ have bigger clients.  
I _should_ have bigger billings.  
I _should_ have more followers.  
I _should_ have more subscribers.

Believe me, I’m intimately familiar with the disease. And that’s why I feel I
can speak from experience when I invite you to consider:

**What if you _are_ exactly where you deserve to be?**

What if the market is actually treating you fairly?  
_What if you’re actually just not that good?_

Well, I’ve got some bad news for you: this is probably true. You probably
aren’t the victim of injustice. Your richer competitors probably aren’t just
“lucky”. You’re probably earning just the right amount. No more, no less. Your
results are probably an accurate reflection of your worth.

You, in fact, are _not_ enough.

Ouch.

But don’t worry, I have some good news too. This bomb I’ve just dropped? This
horrible possibility that the market is just? It isn’t bad news at all.

**In fact it’s fucking fantastic.**

You see, this delusion that we all harbour – this delusion that we’re better
than we really are – is a trap. A horrible one. It’s a trap that makes us feel
like we’re “complete” and “full” in our abilities, and that we have nothing
left to learn. This in turn makes us feel like we have limited options. Like
there is nothing we can do to grow, to make more sales, to get more clients.
We’re already great, and it’s not working, so we’re screwed!

It’s a deeply disempowering belief to have. It makes us feel helpless.

But the belief that we’re getting what we deserve?

This is the opposite.  
This is empowering.  
Massively so.

This means we have so much _more_ to learn. So much _more_ to improve. So much
_more_ to add. It means we _aren’t_ in fact complete; we’re a work in
progress. We have headroom. We are a vessel that is only half full, and that
is still near the start of its journey, rather than near the end.

Understanding this transforms the way we think about growth.

We realise that far from being this opaque, unpredictable, unfair game, it’s
in fact a simple correlation with our abilities. That means that if we want
more growth, all we have to do is improve. All we have to do is learn.

Look at my own example.

At the start of this year I thought I was creating this “amazing” content, but
I had very little traction. A disempowering belief to have.

But then I:

• Did THREE courses on Linkedin  
• Studied copywriting  
• Dug deep into the analytics of my posts  
• Worked with some coaches

…and now I’ve got a big fat audience.

This all came from accepting that _I wasn’t good enough_. And now, when I look
back on the posts I was doing at the start of the year, it’s clear to me why
they weren’t performing. They were, in fact, getting the attention they
deserved.

You have to believe this.  
You have to believe that the market is just.  
You have to believe that its feedback is accurate.

If you don’t, then why would you even play the game? Why would you participate
in a system that is so manifestly unfair, that is just the roll of a dice?
What a colossal waste of time that would be!

So my impassioned plea to you is this. Stop thinking you’re the best. Stop
thinking your business is the best. Stop thinking you’re complete. Stop
thinking your business is complete. Open your eyes to all that you’re bad at –
_to all there is to learn_.

Do this, and growth is at your fingertips; as simple as filling your vessel.
