If you’re a big corporation, it now seems more likely than not that you’ll get
caught up in a major public scandal. The convergence of 1) rapidly changing
cultural norms, 2) increased transparency, and 3) a media climate that values
outrage as the most potent currency, means that it’s really a matter of
“when”, not “if” your 15 minutes of shame rolls around.

We all remember the trials of Starbucks, Uber, Pepsi, United; these are just
some of the most memorable corporate sinners of recent times. The full list of
course is far longer and growing daily.

Faced with such an inevitability, businesses would do well to pre-plan their
responses. When the bell tolls for thee, how are you going to handle it? The
answer to that question is kind of dependent on one thing – whether the bad
publicity matters at all.

By “matter” I don’t mean whether a sinning company should change its ways or
not – that is a separate moral question that needs to be evaluated on a case
by case basis. No, what I mean is whether it matters to the bottom line.
Whether these scandals actually negatively affect the company they embroil.

What I’m going to suggest is that – assuming the publicity doesn’t violate the
“Congruency Rule”, more on which later – then no, it doesn’t really matter at
all.

To illustrate this point, let’s look at the evidence – of which these days we
happily have no shortage. Have big sinners actually seen their results take a
hit following their missteps?

Clearly, this is quite a tricky thing to establish, since company performance
is obviously dictated by a number of factors, and it’s near impossible to
isolate the effect of a scandal within them. If their performance is bad, how
do we know that isn’t because of unfavourable market conditions, or poor
strategic decisions, rather than bad PR? And if their performance is good, how
do we know that it wouldn’t have been even better without the criticism?
Precisely speaking, we don’t know. What we do know however is whether the
scandal had such a negative effect that it made a marked and obvious
difference to their performance – for example, a sudden drop in sales
following the media storm, or a sudden downwards trajectory with that as the
inflection point.

Judging by this standard, the results have been pretty clear – bad publicity
has not noticeably damaged these companies. Sure, you’ll find some reports
detailing an increase in negative opinion, but ultimately we must judge people
on what they do rather than what they say – and in action if not in word, the
public seems pretty forgiving.

In some cases the companies in question have had difficult times, such as
Starbucks following their numerous tax scandals, but have attributed their
difficulties to other factors. This is plausible since in the same period that
Starbucks recorded a 3.4% drop in sales in the UK, Amazon, equally reviled for
their tax trickery, enjoyed a 12% rise. Given that Starbucks is clearly at the
plateauing stage of the product lifecycle, it doesn’t seem reasonable to blame
their decline on tax practices employed by many other businesses – and it
probably won’t be reasonable to blame the inevitable upcoming poor performance
on their more recent service-related troubles.

More commonly, however, reviled businesses actually see positive performance
in the wake of the scandal. [Pepsi happily reported an uptick in revenue and
profit](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/07/11/pepsico-
earnings/465488001/) following their Kendall Jenner embarrassment, and [Uber
enjoyed an acceleration in growth](http://fortune.com/2017/03/22/uber-
scandals-user-growth/) during a string of accusations that even included a
boycott campaign. As for United Airlines, [explored in detail
before](https://basicarts.org/united-enjoyed-record-quarter-dragging-guy-off-
plane/), the quarter after dragging David Dao off their plane saw them record
their best sales ever. No matter how you cut it, the damage accrued by these
companies seemed to range from negligible to arguably beneficial.

To what can we attribute the failure of these attacks? There is partially just
a lack of symmetry at play – a classic media condition wherein the squeaky
wheel gets not only the grease but the column inches. If you have a population
of 1,000 people, of which 2 are angry about something, and 998 don’t give a
damn, you can be sure that their news cycle will be dominated by that issue.
Indifference isn’t interesting. Because of this, businesses can always be
comforted by knowing that no matter how loud the condemnation, it will almost
never represent the majority opinion (unless their sin is truly terrible, in
which case all bets are off and they presumably have bigger things to worry
about).

The other factor is the “Congruency Rule” I mentioned earlier. This dictates
that the only time bad publicity really hurts you, is if it directly
contradicts the value you claim to offer to the market. So for example when
Malaysia Airlines suffered the tragic losses of MH370 and MH17, clearly the
publicity undermined a basic element of any airline’s offer: namely that you
will be safe. Passengers swiftly deserted the carrier, ushering in financial
ruin. By the same token, the recent pummelling of Facebook’s value also
occurred through bad publicity that breaks the Congruency Rule. Judicious
handling of private data and giving truthful information updates are core to
their offering – hence negative publicity arising from failures on these
fronts can be reasonably expected to damage the company.

If you compare these examples to the scandals mentioned earlier, however, you
can see that in no case did the brands in question act incongruently with
their value offering. Uber never pretended to be a kind company. Starbucks
customers don’t frequent it primarily because of its social responsibility
(far from it – it’s a corporate monster in a market that is replete with cute
independent alternatives). And even in the case of United, people were frankly
under no illusions as to the quality of its service – it’s famously awful;
just as you would expect from what has essentially become a no-nonsense budget
provider.

So, in short, did any of these companies do anything that would affect their
ability to deliver value to the public? Indirectly, perhaps, but directly not
at all. This, therefore, isolates all of the damage to the groups of people
who care deeply about the issue at hand – people who represent an unusually
engaged and conscientious form of consumer, and who in many cases don’t even
overlap with the business’ core consumer base. Care about service? You
probably don’t pick United. Dislike the excesses of global megacorps? You
probably don’t pick Starbucks. Like companies who focus on ethics? You
probably pick Lyft over Uber. And if you value authenticity? Then I don’t see
you loving Pepsi.

Therefore, when the angry gaze of public opprobrium turns to you before you
react simply ask yourself one question – has our sin contradicted what we
claim to offer the market? Have we acted incongruently? If the answer is no
then – assuming the scandal is within the normal bounds of severity – it will
blow over. But if the answer is yes – well, good luck.
