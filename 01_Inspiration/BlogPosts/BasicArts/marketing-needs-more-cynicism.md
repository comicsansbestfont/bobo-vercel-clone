Frank Zappa, when asked “why modern music sucks”, had an interesting answer
which is highly instructive for the degradation of all sorts of artistic
disciplines – not least marketing. It’s an answer you wouldn’t expect, but one
which once you’ve wrapped your head around it makes perfect sense. He believed
the problem began when people who _actually liked_ music started working in
the industry.

In the good old days, the theory goes, music was run by your stereotypical
executive fat cats. Out-of-touch old men who couldn’t care less about the
“craft” of music so long as the plebs were willing to pay for it. For them
selling records was a cynical exercise; dividing the market into chunks and
testing different artists to see what floated and to see what sank. The last
thing on their minds was whether or not they actually “liked” the material
they were selling – indeed quite the opposite. Most of it sounded like
complete garbage to them, but hey, it’s what the kids are buying so we’ll go
with it.

Now although we may see that as a sad way to run a creative industry, it does
have one key benefit. If the decision makers are completely indifferent as to
what succeeds and what doesn’t, they are far more likely to let a diverse
selection of material though the gates. In practise having _no taste_ is
exactly the same as having _incredibly eclectic taste_ , as in either event
you are likely to be extremely open minded. This cynical commercialism was
responsible for incredible creative leaps during the golden age of popular
music from the 50s to the 80s, as the executives got out of the way and
allowed the market to make the creative decisions.

Lets compare that to the way music is run today – at least according to Zappa.
Rather than being dusty old codgers, music executives are now deeply
passionate and knowledgeable about their art-form. They love music – and this
is a serious problem. Why? Because if an executive has a creative opinion
about their product they will inevitably favour that which fits with their
taste. They will see it as their job to promote “good” music – meaning that
which they prefer – and as such will suffocate diversity in the industry,
gradually turning everything into a samey-sounding mush.

Imagine if the executives of the 50s and 60s had allowed personal “artistic”
opinions to influence the music they sold? Instead of Elvis Presley and Jimi
Hendrix we’d have been served a perpetual helping of warmed-over Glenn Miller
remixes. But fortunately the record companies of the day cared more about
money than music, and thus the landscape was allowed to change radically year
upon year, with an ever greater diversity of product serving the diversity of
the market.

By now perhaps you can see the relevance of this story in the world of
marketing. The “millennial insights deck” has become something of a running
joke in the industry, with every client having been subjected to some blend of
recycled guff about “experience seekers” favouring brands who are “making the
world a better place” and so on. The supposed ubiquity of this audience and
their opinions has, in turn, created in an entire generation of brands which
are seemingly engineered to appeal to the same handful of people in
Shoreditch, whilst ignoring the rest of the world who aren’t part of this
“millennial revolution”. Why? Because these are the people who work in
marketing. These are the people who populate agencies, who populate media
outlets. This isn’t, of course, a problem on the face of it – every industry
has a particular demographic bent – the problem is that they _care_. They love
what they do. They want to produce “good work”, work which “makes a
difference” – and that means they will inevitably churn out an endless parade
of brands which do just that; a generation of pseudo-Patagonias across a
variety of industries whilst other directions are left unexplored because they
don’t represent what is honourable and pure.

Marketing then, is in desperate need of a bit of cynicism; a bit of a return
to the “dark old days” of the Don Draper-type figures we’re encouraged not to
mourn. They neither liked nor believed in much of the work they churned out,
but that didn’t matter because someone out there did. They recognised that
their job was to _diversify_ output, not homogenise it. They weren’t there to
educate or elevate, but to serve; a humble approach that ironically arises
from a hard-nosed commercial outlook, not an artistic one.

So if someone tells you that your brand in some way falls short of the
millennial ideal, simply slip into your pin-stripe suit, fire up a cigar, put
your feet up on the desk, and tell them “good”. For the supposedly
“artistically bereft” has always been what sells across a variety of
industries, the creative ones included, because the distinctive will beat the
tasteful every time, no matter how cynically derived.
