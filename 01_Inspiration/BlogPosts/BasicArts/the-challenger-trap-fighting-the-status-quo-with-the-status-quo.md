Once up on a time, to be a “challenger brand” simply meant that you weren’t
number one.

On this basis pretty much any brand could be framed as such, without it really
saying anything about their philosophy or approach to the market. One of the
original challenger brands, for example, was Avis, the car rental guys. There
wasn’t much more to their challenger status than simply “owning” their
position as number two behind Hertz – exemplified by their classic ad campaign
which stated “we’re number two so we try harder”.

Pretty basic stuff.

However today, I think we all recognise that “challenger” has come to mean
something more than simply “not the market leader”.

To be a challenger brand is to be a particular _type_ of brand, rather than
size. It carries with it suggestions of a “rebellious” and “youthful” nature.
Hoodies and sneakers rather than jackets and ties. Unorthodox vacation
policies, flat hierarchies, and slick design. There is definitely a “feeling”
to what a challenger brand should be – a feeling so distinctive that there are
arguably various categories today where the number one is seen as a
“challenger” and the number two is not.

In short it’s become a more of a worldview than a position in the market – one
we might summarise as:

**Opposition to the status quo.**

Now on the face of it this all sounds great – and quite aligned with the kinds
of stuff we talk about in these pieces. But there is a problem.

You see there comes a point where certain challenger brands become so
successful, that their position ceases to be “against the status quo”, and
instead _becomes_ the status quo.

Brand icons like [Nike](https://basicarts.org/nike-and-the-concept-of-
cultural-innovation/), Ben & Jerry’s, and Patagonia all began with counter-
cultural, counter-category plays, that’s for sure. But today they are all the
_very opposite_ of those things. They represent the heart of their respective
categories, and profoundly “establishment” cultural positions.

Now there’s absolutely nothing wrong that – especially from their
perspectives. On the contrary, the best thing you can be is the arch
representative of the status quo – and I would encourage any brand who has
that opportunity to grab it with both hands, and forget all this challenger
crap.

No, the problem comes for the next generation of challenger brands. They look
at these icons, think “that’s what a challenger brand looks like”, and then
copy them – without realising that this is the exact opposite of challenger
behaviour.

Clearly a true challenger to Nike, or Ben & Jerry’s, or Patagonia, or any
other established ex-challenger brand, would be nothing like them. But that’s
not what we see. We instead tend to see a flood of copycats who think they are
being disruptive because they’re copying what was disruptive 30 years ago –
without realising that they are simply echoing what has become the
establishment.

**This then is the challenger trap:**

Where upcoming brands adopt positions which used to be challenger in their
category, but have now become orthodoxy – and so end up fighting the status
quo with the status quo.

The challenger trap doesn’t only play out in categories where there is a big
sexy ex-challenger at the heart of them. These days boring corporates have
become quite adept at mimicking challenger positions as soon as they become
popular – thereby negating any threat from below that may arise.

To give you a concrete example of this, think about the UK grocery scene.

The quintessential challenger in this space was, unquestionably, Innocent –
who came to dominate the drinks market 20 years ago through their “tastes good
does good” positioning, and their artful blend of healthy product and ethical
behaviour.

Thanks to their success, almost every challenger food and bev brand since has
been something of a “mini-Innocent” – a strategy that on the whole has worked
quite well, since there are lots of other categories in store where Innocent
don’t play.

Today however, in 2021, you are deluded if you think that “health” + “ethics”
is in any way counter cultural – even amongst the big corporates. I had to
laugh the other day when I learned that Alpro, a soy products giant owned by
Danone, who are pretty much as establishment as they come in the UK, now uses
the platform “good for you, good for the planet”. For them this is a brilliant
play, since big brands with big budgets like them are able to take ownership
of the status quo. But for challengers, this should be taken as a signal that
the health and ethics ship has sailed. It is no longer an effective lever
against the market leaders; it’s their own lever.

_(Needless to say this doesn’t mean that current challengers need to be
“unhealthy” or “unethical” – although this would at least be a genuine
challenger position. It simply means that they have to find new battle grounds
on which to fight, new angles with which to challenge, rather than relying on
these orthodoxies)._

At the end of the day if you’re a real challenger brand, your life should be
pretty uncomfortable. You should be raising a few eyebrows, attracting
criticism, and running a bit of risk.

After all, that’s what happens when you challenge the status quo. That’s what
happened to the iconic challengers back in the day.

But if you feel safe and celebrated, and are attracting approval from all the
right places, then that doesn’t sound like a challenger to me. That sounds
more like a pet. A pet of the establishment, who are happy for you to have the
crumbs beneath their table while they dominate the very position you think is
so new and edgy.

Not every brand needs to be a rebel. That’s just a style. But every brand does
need to bring something fresh to the party. And if you can’t do that then
you’re not a challenger, by any definition.
