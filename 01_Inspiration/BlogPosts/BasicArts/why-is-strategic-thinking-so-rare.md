I saw an old Peter Drucker quote today which really got me thinking:

“Efficiency is doing things right. Effectiveness is doing the right things”.

Efficiency versus effectiveness. Doing things right, versus doing the right
things. Two deceptively similar modes of working, which are in fact miles
apart. One means doing something well, with quality, with skill. And the other
simply means choosing what to do in the first place – i.e. the very essence of
strategy.

It strikes me that the confusion between these two concepts – and the fact
that for most people they are basically the same thing – is the root cause for
the lack of strategic thinking found in organisations across the world.

When you think about it you’ll find that almost every job in the whole world
is a “doing things right” job, rather than a “doing the right things” one.
Most people are trained and employed to do a discrete thing which can be done
well or badly. Most people are educated that way too. Are you “good” at maths,
are you “good” at English, are you “good” at physics. Most of us are trained,
first and foremost, to be  _quality operators_. People who are skilled at the
task that’s put in front of us.

This is fine of course, as ultimately doing things well is crucial. But it
always assumes the presence of someone above us to  _give_ us the task in the
first place. To give us the order. To make the decision. And so we are never
really prepared to take on that responsibility for ourselves when it finally
arrives.

You see it is not natural to mature from being an “efficiency” operator to an
“effectiveness” operator, and yet we act as if it were. People are promoted on
their ability to  _do tasks well_ until suddenly they find themselves in a
position where their job is to  _choose what tasks to do_ , and they stumble –
because there is no linear relationship there.

This is one of the reasons for the so-called “Peter Principle”, whereby
everyone gets promoted to their level of incompetence. There is a moment where
a job suddenly jumps from the operational to the strategic, and nobody is
prepared for it, because it represents a fundamentally different way of
working. As a result most simply ignore the change; neglecting their strategic
responsibilities as if they didn’t exist, and “managing down” to the
operational level where they feel comfortable.

Entire companies – including some very successful ones – are run this way.

This silent chasm between efficiency and effectiveness probably explains why
so many business leaders make the error of assuming that “doing things well”
and being “better than their competitors” will make them succeed in the
market. It stands to reason right? After all, they’ve spent their entire lives
in an efficiency paradigm, where quality is what counts. It’s how they got
their degree, how they got their job, how they got promoted. So why wouldn’t
it be how a business is run too?

But it isn’t. Businesses succeed on the  _strength of their choices_ far more
than the skill with which they execute those choices. The variance in
executional quality between competitors is negligible, but the variance in
decision making can be gigantic, and hence this this is where leverage lies.

It’s the most important part of the game, and yet one which is barely noticed;
running almost exclusively on autopilot.

The only solution to this dilemma I can think of is to emphasise the
_reasons_ for your decisions throughout the whole organisation; top to bottom.
To share your thought process. To share the thinking behind everything that
everyone takes for granted.

This doesn’t mean giving everyone decision making responsibilities – at a
strategic level there are only so many decisions to make – but it does mean
making it clear that the things you are doing are not arbitrary, and weren’t
chosen lazily, but rather were carefully selected from many other potential
options.

It’s a good test for you too, because if you can’t share your thinking then
there probably is no thinking!

Most won’t care about the decision making process one way or another, and will
be happy to simply crack on. And that’s fine. But those that do show an
interest? They’re the ones who need promoting – whether they’re good at
executing or not.
