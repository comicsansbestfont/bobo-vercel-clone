_The following, as suggested by the title, is an update to my old post
cataloguing various strategic hacks, tricks, and thought experiments._

The article and old items are the same as before, but I’ve added a bunch of
new ones – which I’ve highlighted for people who read the original already.

Hope it’s of use, stay tuned for volume 3!

One question I’m asked, again and again, is what I think of Simon Sinek’s
famous “why”.

If you don’t know what this is, then I’m very surprised that you’re reading
this newsletter. However to offer a totally redundant recap, his basic thesis
was that “people don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it”, i.e. the
philosophical motivation for your business rather what the product itself
actually offers.

When I’m asked this question, the inflection generally either expects me to
offer an enthusiastic endorsement of the idea, or to rip it to shreds (with
the latter becoming increasingly common as time rolls by). Unfortunately I’m
not really able to offer either of these, because whilst I think the concept
is in no way a universal solution that will solve a brand’s every problem (I’d
estimate that for 80% it’s pretty useless), I’d also concede that on occasion,
when things are lined up just right, it can be really useful. Some companies
have indeed had genuine breakthroughs by “finding their why”.

_(Incidentally I would also say that it’s really a leadership tool rather than
one for strategic positioning, and in that capacity it’s more useful, but I
digress..)_

So this is just the thing. Like all strategic “models”, Sinek’s why is great
_some_ of the time, but useless _most_ of the time. And this has presented a
big problem to the “strategic industry” at large.

You see, in order to gain competitive advantage, make headlines, write books,
and charge more, the industry has always essentially had to lie. This lie is
always the same: the lie that there can be one model or framework to rule them
all. One proprietary process that a consultancy has come up with which leaves
all the others in the dust, and that you simply must adopt if you want to
achieve stunning growth.

Any time a consultancy’s process has a name (especially with a registered
trademark), you know they’re playing this game.

Now these processes are by no means bad – on the contrary, often they’re very
clever – but they will always run into scenarios where they aren’t
appropriate. On such occasions you’d be better off with nothing – just as a
lost traveller would be better off no map than a map of a different place to
the one they’re in.

For this reason, I use no map.

It doesn’t look as flashy or professional, and gives projects a rambling
informal feel – but fundamentally it’s _honest_.

Continuing the analogy however, even if you don’t have a map telling you where
to go, that doesn’t mean there aren’t other tricks, techniques, and
understandings a skilled navigator might be able to use to find their way: the
position of the stars; the way moss grows on a tree; the direction of a
stream; etc.

Strategy is much the same, and so here I wanted to compile a list of these
informal ideas in case you find them helpful. Not one idea to rule them all,
but a bag of them to be mixed as appropriate.

This is basically a bundle of various ideas I’ve written about in the past
summarised in one place, so apologies for repetition, but I thought this
format might be helpful.

They are by no means comprehensive – other people will have others, and if you
know of any yourself please do share and I’ll add to the list. Equally _most
won’t be useful_ on a given project; that’s why you need a blend of many to
find your way. In the future, when I’ve come up with more, I’ll send you an
updated list.

It’s long, so think of this less like an “essay”, and more like a little
resource you might find useful in the future.

Off we go…

**The strategic hierarchy**

The whole of a company can be boiled down into three cascading pieces: the
value proposition, the brand, and delivery. The value proposition is what the
business _offers_ to the market. The brand is how that value is
_communicated_. And the delivery is, obviously, how the value is _delivered_.
That’s all there is to it. One, two, three. Get these lined up, and you’ll
have something great on your hands.

**NEW – The most simple strategic framework**

The value proposition in the hierarchy is the strategy. There is no rule for
how this should be written, however a very basic framework can be found in the
cascade: goal, strategy, actions. What is the thing you’re trying to achieve,
how will you achieve it, and what actions are required to make it happen.
There’s nothing clever about this, but it does have a couple of advantages. By
separating “goal” and “strategy” it should stop you falling into the common
trap of confusing the two. And by prioritising “actions”, it forces you to get
practical (too many strategies are pure theory). The following diagram
illustrates the dynamic of this cascade, whereby _the strategy represents the
sum of the actions_ , which are drawn together to achieve the goal.

**NEW – The first goal of strategy**

We all know that strategy is meant to differentiate you from your competitors.
That goes without saying. However there is one other thing it’s meant to do
which is even more fundamental – to differentiate you from _yourself_. To make
you different than you were yesterday. It’s easy to spin some bullshit
strategy, change nothing, and rationalise that you’re “being strategic” – but
it’s a lie. A strategy only exists if it results in blatantly obvious change
before and after. Therefore the first question you should be asking, if you
want to judge a strategy, is “has this made us different?”. If not, then the
strategy simply doesn’t exist.

**NEW – The two types of strategy**

Depending on where your business is in its development, there are two
different ways to approach strategy. If your business is still in the startup
phase, and is pre reliable profitability, you need a starter strategy. Starter
strategies are built on limited information, and thus are speculative,
experimental, and probably temporary. You get them from observing the market,
and asking what it needs. If however your business is mature and profitable,
you need a maturation strategy, which is more empirical and internally
focused, asking “what have we made here?”. This aims to cement a permanent
direction you’ll follow forever more – like Dolly Parton said “find out who
you are, and then do it on purpose”. This table sketches the difference
between the two.

**Weirding the normal / normaling the weird**

One most of you will be familiar with, separating all brands into one of two
boxes: those which need to “weird the normal”, and those which need to “normal
the weird”. Most fall into the former category, and are defined as brands who
make a product which is fundamentally similar to their competitors: soap,
shoes, cars, cereal, accountancy software, gyms, engine oil, etc. – these are
all things people are _familiar_ with, and as such successful brands in these
spaces need to make these old ideas seem “weird” and fresh. Some brands
however make products which are genuinely new and different – e.g. Uber,
Airbnb, Peoloton, etc. In these cases their job is the opposite: they need to
make their “scary” and “confusing” new idea seem familiar and safe. Hence
“normaling the weird”. Knowing which you are sets a good foundation from which
to proceed.

**The strategic lifecycle**

The three stages all brands must pass through to strategic maturity:
experimentation, consolidation, acceleration. Most never leave the first
stage, which just as it sounds, means experimenting in order to try and
stumble across market traction. The smart ones however, when they have
traction, attempt to consolidate, by asking _why_ they have that traction.
What have they hit upon? Knowing the answer they are then able to start doing
this thing in a deliberate and focused way – _acceleration_. Short of getting
extremely lucky, this is the only way to become strategically powerful.

**Contrarian value**

Everybody should understand the importance of offering _new value_ to a
market. If you don’t achieve this, then why bother? Fewer however understand
the importance of offering _contrarian value_ – which is not only new, but in
active disagreement with the other brands in the category. “They think X but
we think Y”. By doing this, you are able to not only bring something new to
the table, but do it in a way that your competitors can’t copy, because to do
so would involve undermining their own position.

**Only is better than best**

This one is quite simply about avoiding the temptation to try to be “better”
than your competitors. Better simply means “the same”. It means “we both do
this thing, but we do it a tiny bit more”. It doesn’t generate market traction
(although everyone thinks it does). Instead you should always try to focus on
being the “only X”, rather than the “best X”. This grammatical requirement
will force you to push your strategy to new places.

**NEW – The challenger trap**

The challenger trap can best be defined as “fighting the status quo with the
status quo” – when a startup tries to challenge the dominant brands in its
category _using the same position those brands already hold_. Why does this
happen? Well, most categories these days are now dominated by a brand that
once upon a time was a textbook “challenger” (e.g. Apple, Innocent, etc.).
This led to the values of these brands becoming labelled “challenger” even
though they are now the dominant forces in the market. As a result wannabe
challenger brands tend to foolishly copy these brands, thinking they are being
challenging when in fact they are doing the opposite. They forget a challenger
to Innocent wouldn’t look like Innocent; _it would stand against Innocent_.
Don’t let your admiration for the old guard blind you to the fact they are now
the bad guys.

**The one click rule**

Lots of young brands, understanding the importance of being new and different,
take it too far. They try to be as different as possible on every metric you
can imagine. This is a mistake. Generally speaking consumers are only prepared
to take one step – or “one click” – away from what they are familiar with.
That’s why if you’re doing something new, you should work hard to make sure
all the other aspects of your brand are as normal as possible. Otherwise you
end up with this really wacky thing which people simply don’t get. Only change
that which your strategy demands. With the rest, be boring as possible.

**Cross category copying**

Copy is bad, except when it isn’t. And that is when you copy from brands in
categories completely unconnected to your own. Whatever your value proposition
is, chances are someone will be offering something quite similar in a
different space. If they have been successful, they will have “trained”
consumers to expect this proposition to look and feel a certain way. Do
yourself a favour and copy it. Make use of the hard work someone else has
done. This will help you build the holy grail: a brand which is both _unique_
(within its category) but also _familiar_ (within the consumer’s brain).

**NEW – The toilet paper rule**

Naturally, we all look up to the sexiest brands out there. Apple, Patagonia,
Tesla, Supreme, Red Bull, Nike etc. This is generally OK, since they do indeed
have a lot to teach us. However there is one big problem: they all occupy
_intrinsically interesting categories_. Consumer tech, outdoor gear, athletic
fashion, luxury cars etc. – these are things people are interested in
regardless of the brand. And that means brands within those categories have a
far greater bandwidth to sell sophisticated stories and strategies – simply
because the punters are paying more attention. Most brands don’t occupy such
categories. In fact most brands occupy categories consumers don’t give a shit
about. As a result their strategies must be much more shallow and direct –
like the Andrex puppy communicating “softness” (hence the toilet paper rule).
Bottom line you must respect the consumer’s indifference. If you don’t, you’ll
end up looking ridiculous. Here’s a handy graph to show what I mean.

**Weakness cultivation**

Any old idiot can focus on what they want to do well. Far less common is to
focus on what you want to do poorly – which is a shame, as it’s a good way to
unlock significant value. If you can identify something which all your
competitors do well, but which you don’t want to focus on, then you should
take things one step further and explore what it would look like if you were
to _absolutely suck_ at that thing. Or better still, simply don’t do it at
all. Sometimes this can unlock the opportunity to do something extremely
powerful which simply wasn’t possible while that other value was still in play
– the classic example being the low cost airline category’s abandonment of
business travellers.

**The true competitor**

Most people think, understandably, that their competitors are those things
that look like them. Although this may be the case, it is rarely sufficient,
as in fact your true competitor is “that thing which people might buy instead
of you”. Sometimes this can be incredibly different – such as how a Harley’s
true competitor might be seen as a conservatory. By understanding yours, you
are able to understand the shape of your _real category_ – not the one marked
out by arbitrary data, but the much more important one that exists in
consumers’ heads. This can and should wildly change how you behave, as you
discover a whole new “market” to navigate.

**The targeting paradox**

Conventional wisdom would say that the wider your target market, the more
people you will appeal to. This is a mistake, since the more acceptable you
attempt to be, the more bland and thus invisible and unexciting you will
become. Instead it can be a good idea to make your hypothetical target market
extremely narrow – much too small on paper for you to grow. By doing this you
are able to shape yourself for a really interesting and aspirational “ideal
customer”, and thus become more distinctive. This distinctiveness will then be
picked up on by consumers who sit _outside_ of that target, but who will then
buy you anyway (because punters care far more about something being vivd and
eye catching than being made “for them”). Thus your appeal grows as it
narrows.

**Clustering / declustering**

Clustering is a phenomenon that occurs when the process of competition in a
market makes its brands more and more alike. This happens because when one
makes a certain play, the others, not wanting to be left behind, copy it.
Gradually over time, as they copy each other, they begin to converge until the
market is commoditised. Declustering on the other hand occurs when competitors
leave each other to their own devices, and let each other look after their own
part of the market. “Divide and conquer” if you like. In this scenario the
market becomes more richly served, and profits grow for everyone.

**Leading by following**

People think a founder’s job is to lead their company, but the truth is kinda
the opposite. Their primary job is to follow it. This is because it is almost
impossible to predict how a business will perform in the market before the
fact – it will always behave in unexpected ways. Therefore in order to make
the business work, you must let it find its own position, and then get on
board with that _whether or not it was what you originally intended_. In
software they call this the search for product market fit. This is where I
always repeat the great Dolly Parton line: “find out who you are, and then do
it on purpose” — which is very different from “decide who you want to be”,
which doesn’t work nearly as well.

**Blanding**

Not one I coined sadly, but everyone loves it. A “bland” is a brand who has
consciously or unconsciously copied the norms of “modern” brands like Harry’s
shave, Casper mattresses, and the hundreds of other brands like them. Pastel
colours, androgynous / feminine vibe, thoughtful “story”, twee copy, elegant
typography, and all the rest. There’s nothing wrong with any of this in and of
itself, only it has become so ubiquitous that it struggles to stand out. Hence
“bland”. It also only really caters to one part of the market and one kind of
consumer, leaving the rest of the market underserved, and commercial potential
withering on the vine.

**NEW – Minimum viable strategy**

The great brands are those who follow their strategies to extreme, and thus
remarkable degrees. They don’t just offer “X”, they go overboard in offering
it. Still, admirable as this is, realistically most brands will never get
there. Instead they would be better advised not to let “perfect be the enemy
of the good”, and simply ask “what is the minimum we would need to do to be
following this strategy?”. In other words, where is the binary dividing line
between delivering on it, and not? Figuring this out will enable you to pick
out the actions and changes to prioritise, so you can move quickly and
decisively.

**The creative canvas**

This is the space on which you can bring your brand to life. For most it is
simply their media assets (logo, ads, and the like). But for the best, it is
their whole company, guts and all. You should endeavour to map it by making a
list of all the different “parts” of your organisation which you could
creatively spin, and then going through them one by one and “brandifying” them
in line with your strategy. This is how you create a business which is truly
remarkable and juicy in its space.

**NEW – The subjectivity test**

As a pal of mine once said, “if I ever see an agency describe themselves as
creative, I immediately know that they aren’t”. Subjective language – good,
better, best, excellent etc. – has no place in a strategy, value offering, or
anything of the sort. Subjective judgements belong to the consumer, not to
you. Your job is enact an objective strategy which you hope will yield those
judgements. In my experience if a strategy has subjective language anywhere
with it, then it’s a strategy void of content. Ruthlessly expunge any such
words, and see what you have left.

**The strategy paradox**

Another one I didn’t coin but wish I had, the strategy paradox is the
acknowledgement that having a strong strategy does’t only raise your chances
of massive success – it raises the chances of massive failure as well. As the
originator of the phrase, Michael Raynor, put it: “the opposite of success is
not failure but mediocrity”. When you follow a strategy you are making a bet
on something – a bet which might work, and might not. The absence of strategy
on the other hand generally means refusing to make a bet, and just muddling
along in a reactive fashion. This latter approach probably won’t take you
anywhere exciting, but on the plus side it is very low risk. So whilst
strategy is great, be aware of what you’re getting yourself into.

**Strategic commitment**

This is just what it sounds like: having a strategy and committing to it
fully, with emphasis on the commitment side of the equation. A strategy,
naturally, is only as good as its execution, and a hardcore execution of a
mediocre strategy is a hell of a lot better than a limp execution of a great
strategy. Indeed many businesses have become wildly successful purely through
aggressive execution of thoroughly mundane and undifferentiated positions – so
at a push sufficiently punchy execution can replace the need for strategy all
together.

**NEW – Multi-layer pacing**

How often should a strategy change? The answer is never. Once a business has
matured it basically is what it is, it offers what it offers, and it shouldn’t
deviate from that hard won reputation. However this doesn’t mean the
behaviours of the business shouldn’t change. They should, a lot, because to
hold a steady strategy requires constant change. The world is moving, so if
you want to stand still you need to move with it. The way to think of this is
to imagine the pace of change increasing as you move from macro to micro. Your
strategy should never change; your product should sometimes change; your
marketing should change often. This diagram sketches the concept.

I’m definitely missing out a bunch here, but that will do for now!

If you like then file it away, and hopefully it will come in useful from time
to time when you’re looking for new ways to approach a problem.
