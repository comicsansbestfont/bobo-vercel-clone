All businesses have a brand.

All have a product.

All have people, sales, marketing, and various other building blocks which add
up to “a company”.

**But not all – in fact very few – have a strategy.**

I don’t mean to say here that most businesses have bad strategies (though
quite a lot do). I mean, quite literally, that most businesses have _no
strategy_. They simply have a void, a vacuum, where one would normally be.

Needless to say vanishingly few of these would admit to having no strategy. I
guess everyone thinks they have one. But the evidence to the contrary is
overwhelming, and easy to find. Simply ask them whether the business in
question has a clear and focused direction, which carves out unique market
space, and which everyone in senior management can eloquently and consistently
explain on demand.

If you don’t have that – and almost nobody does – then you have no strategy.
Or at least, not a conscious one.

This has always struck me as very weird. After all, not many people dispute
the value of strategy, and pretty much all of them pay it lip service, so
you’d think it would be pretty commonplace. But clearly it’s not.

A lot of this of course comes down to the well documented confusion
surrounding the term. The majority of people – even a sizeable chunk of CEOs –
don’t really know what a strategy is. Hence the stubborn persistence of
strategies like:

“To go international”  
“To double in size”  
“To be number one”

…and so on.

This is pretty well-worn territory, so I won’t go on about it too much here.
Instead I want to mention another more subtle and perhaps more common reason
that strategy is forgotten.

It’s summed up by this quote from a mentor of mine:

“When a business isn’t working, they always try to fix things with either
sales or marketing, even though their problem is strategic”.

What’s he saying here?

Well, as we’ve discussed before, strategies alone don’t actually do anything.
It is only _execution_ of the strategy that matters. A strategy without
execution is like a conductor without an orchestra – some idiot gesticulating
into the ether with no meaningful results. What the conductor needs, like the
strategist, is tools of implementation – whether they be violins and oboes; or
in the case of a business, brand, product, marketing, sales, and so on.

Now because it is the tangible executional factors that do the heavy lifting,
it is they that get the credit for the result. It is they that get the
attention:

  * We credit brand for Nike’s success
  * We credit logistics for Amazon’s success
  * We credit R&D and patents for Pfizer’s success
  * We credit design for Apple’s success

Consequently, companies tend to jump to execution when they have a problem.
They jump to solution. They know that execution solves problems, so they are
doing something apparently logical.

But what they miss is that behind every amazing execution, just like every
great symphony, is a strategy guiding the way.

Although this isn’t always the case (and I want to stress that), it’s fair to
say as a general rule that if you think you have a marketing problem, **_you
actually have a strategy problem_**. If you have a sales problem, **_you
actually have a strategy problem_**. If you have basically any kind of problem
which pertains to the company’s performance in the market, **_then you have a
strategy problem_**.

All those things in your business you think aren’t working probably aren’t
dysfunctional because they’re poorly implemented. They’re dysfunctional
because they lack coherent and effective direction. It might be true that,
say, a new brand is going to solve all your problems. However it will only be
able to do that if a guiding strategy precedes it – not a “brand strategy”,
but a macro market strategy.

Understanding this, it’s very clear why strategy is forgotten:

  1. Because it’s invisible in comparison to its executional manifestations
  2. Because it means that all problems need two solutions, rather than one (a strategy first, and then an execution – and that’s quite a lot to bite off)

It takes patience, guts, and foresight to invest time and money into a process
which, technically, will amount to nothing more than words on a page when it’s
complete – a few words which you may never do anything with. It’s far more
satisfying to do something “real” where no matter what happens you’ll have
something to show for it. To whip out the violin and bash out a few chords.

And who knows, maybe like the monkey’s and their typewriters something
incredible will emerge. But more likely will be just noise. Because it’s not
the notes that make music, but the space between them, and their relationship
with each other – the stuff you can’t hear – that counts.
