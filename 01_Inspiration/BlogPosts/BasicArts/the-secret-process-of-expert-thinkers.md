I’m going to level with you.

It’s about how I work.

And I’ll admit up front, it makes me look kinda lazy and unprofessional.

But through this essay I hope to show that not only is there logic in the
laziness – but that it’s actually the _only_ way to do effective intellectual
and creative work.

**First, here’s the fallacy:**

People assume when I, or someone like me, is working on a project, our process
goes something like this:

  * Gather the data
  * Interrogate the data
  * Come to the rational conclusion the data demands

…and thus you have your strategy. Or your idea. Or your thesis. Or whatever it
is you’re trying to come up with.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’d to work like this. There’s an air of certainty in
this approach, which would certainly take the pressure off. It would make
every job like a maths problem, which you just need to plod through to arrive
at the answer. And sometimes, it does happen that way.

But to be honest I just give the _appearance_ of this being the process.

And my suspicion is, we all do.

Consultants.  
Doctors.  
Academics.  
Scientists.

The good ones anyway.

The _real_ process, the one that actually works despite its apparent laziness
and sloppiness, looks more like this:

  * Take a cursory glance at the situation
  * Come up with a random hypothesis or solution, half jokingly
  * Try it on for size, and if it fits, start to look into it more deeply

…and in this way you either discard the half-idea and generate another, or, if
the evidence clicks together (as it does surprisingly often), you roll with
it.

There’s a long reason this is the proper way of doing things, and there’s a
short reason.

The long one concerns sophisticated understanding of complexity, emergence,
and stuff like that. For instance intuitive reactions are “holistic”, and thus
are more balanced than ones you rationalise from data – because the data
you’re working on will always be incomplete, and will thus provoke you to come
to a conclusion that biases _in favour of the data you know_ , and _against
the data you don_ ’t (which may be far more important).

The short reason however can be summed up by this brilliant Rory Sutherland
quote:

“There are far more good ideas that you can post-rationalise than you can pre-
rationalise”.

It really is as simple as that for me.

There’s no deeper proof of this than the fact that this is how _science
itself_ is actually done (despite the propaganda they feed you in school about
the scientific method). I don’t have the info to hand, but there are
compelling studies of the history of medicine that show that almost _no_ drugs
that were “pre-rationalised” (i.e. designed for their eventual purpose).
Pretty much every single one was stumbled upon and post-rationalised.

Of course there is a risk here. Such is the human brilliance for bullshit
post-rationalisation of bad ideas that yes, we can probably talk ourselves
into anything. Including stuff that should never be.

**That’s why we have to temper this process with radical honesty, humility,
and open-mindedness.**

This is the real purpose of research in my view: not so much to “learn things”
(because you can intuit most of it anyway), but rather as a humility exercise.
Exposing your instincts to the light.

In my experience every bad post-rationalisation has at least one horrific
glaring lie embedded within it. Generally in plain sight. Obvious to everyone
involved but carefully unacknowledged. Often such lies are protected by
“taboos” – things that are just as likely to exist within a company as they
are within wider society at large.

However if you are capable of honesty – _true_ honesty – and if you build it
into your process as a deliberate and conscious element, then bad post-
rationalisation is surprisingly easy to avoid.

But anyway, that’s the truth.  
We just take punts.  
Make jokes.  
Go where feels right.  
And put the pieces together later.

As Paul Dirac, big cheese physicist and one of the founders of quantum
mechanics said:

“A theory of beauty is more likely to be correct than an ugly one that fits
some experimental data”.

We’re all engaged in what is ultimately an aesthetic practice. And it serves
us well to accept it.
