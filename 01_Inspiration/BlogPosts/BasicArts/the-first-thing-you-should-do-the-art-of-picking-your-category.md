I’ve now been doing sessions in The Strategy Shortcut System for 2 weeks, and
it’s cool because it’s given me a new perspective.

The “mass” nature of the product has shown more clearly where the most common
strategic missteps lie for most founders – and, as expected, they are in the
places you _least_ expect.

So today I wanted to address one that has been coming up quite a lot:

**Category choice.**

In other words, what _pre-existing_ category of goods and services are you
going to root your business in, and then push on from there?

This is a topic people tend not to think about _at all_ – either because they
see it as being completely obvious, or because they implicitly see their
product as just this unique thing floating in the ether, which will sell on
its own terms.

Both of these are untrue.

There are three reasons thoughtful category choice is essential before doing
anything else:

  1. Because this is the way customers will understand what you do
  2. Because this determines the norms you are going to push against (i.e. it dictates the rest of your strategic thinking)
  3. Because this determines where your customers are going to come from

This final one is particularly important. You see it is incredibly hard to
sell something people aren’t “shopping for” – no matter how good that thing
is. You need your business to tap into an existing “buying process”, otherwise
you basically have to generate interest from zero – which is possible, but
exceptionally difficult.

Let me give you an example.

The other day I was on a group call and someone said that the category of
their product was “online learning”. Bam – immediate red flag. Why? Because
nobody is going around saying “man, what I really need is some online
learning!”. No, what they are shopping for more likely is the _skill_ being
taught in the online learning. The whole “online learning” part has nothing to
do with it, that’s just the delivery method.

I too am in the “online learning” space with The Strategy Shortcut System.
However the category I have rooted this in is not “online learning” – it’s
strategy consultancy. I see this as an alternative to paying someone $100,000
to come and develop a strategy for you.

Now which of these categories sounds like it would afford me more leverage?
And which make my product more clear?

That is how big a decision category choice truly is.

**So how do you pick it?**

The first thing to note, is that category is determined by _the value the
customer gets_ , not _the physical nature of the product_.

Yes, there are some exceptions to this – some categories that are so mature
and clear that they are synonymous with “form” as well as “value”. For example
I think it would be very hard to conceive of a laundry detergent existing in
any other category other than “laundry detergents” – and so that’s totally
fine.

**Sometimes it is indeed a no-brainer.**

But if there’s any hint of ambiguity (and btw, most B2B businesses will exist
in ambiguous spaces), then you have a degree of choice and flexibility – and
so the first place you should be looking is at the job that’s being done by
your business.

The second key consideration is “shoppability”. Is there an existing purchase
cycle you can hijack?

I had one case recently of a woman whose innovative business could be attached
to a clear pre-existing category (great), BUT this category was traditionally
B2B and she wanted to make it D2C. This is a problem because although
consumers were _using_ this product, they weren’t _shopping_ for it. Instead
they were using it indirectly via other services. This means that if she
started selling it directly to them, she would have to generate a whole new
purchase behaviour where none currently exists.

Now theoretically this is possible, but it would be far better for her to
either 1) continue selling B2B to tap into that purchase flow, or 2) choose a
different plausible category entry point where consumers are already shopping,
and then push them to her innovative product through that channel.

Hope this makes sense!

Finally you of course need to consider where you have leverage. This is where
category choice tilts over into strategy. What do you bring to the table here?

Bringing it back to the idea that my “course + tool” product exists in the
category of “strategy consultancy”, you don’t have to think very hard to see
that there are all sorts of forms of leverage there. It’s massively cheaper,
there is no limit to supply, it’s accessible to smaller businesses, etc.

So that’s your checklist.

  * Does your category reflect value (not just product)?
  * Is it something people are shopping for?
  * Do you think you will have leverage there?

For many of you, if you get this choice right… the rest will write itself.
