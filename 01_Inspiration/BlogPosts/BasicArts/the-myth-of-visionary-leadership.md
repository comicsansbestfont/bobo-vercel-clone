Very successful people tend to be surprisingly ordinary.

The average millionaire entrepreneur you meet will tend to be highly
competent, no question, and generally fairly talented in some manner too.
However, they rarely match the image people have in their head of someone
unusually insightful, or brilliant. Typically, in their role of management,
they’re quite normal, and won’t have much more wisdom than the next fellow,
and will be the first to tell you so.

This reality clashes with our belief that successful companies are created by
someone with a deep insight into the market, who designed a product or service
accordingly, and then expertly piloted it to riches and glory. We might call
this the “visionary myth”.

Although there’s certainly an element of this that goes on, a more accurate
understanding of how companies emerge lies in basic statistics:

_Thousands of entrepreneurs throw semi-random ideas into the world, some work,
and some don’t, and nobody really knows which will do which._

The quality of thinking behind the ideas certainly doesn’t tell you. Plenty of
clever ideas fail, and plenty of unimaginative ideas succeed. The fact is that
no level of thinking can accurately predict how a business will interact with
the market when you release it into the real world. The only certainty is that
it won’t behave exactly as you expect.

Understanding this idea is extremely important, because it leads you to the
realisation that businesses have minds of their own. Businesses are, to a
large degree, “self-willed”, and will follow paths which their management
neither expected nor intended.

Just like a child, you can give birth to them, and try and guide them, but
ultimately they will do what they want to do – or perhaps more accurately what
the market wants them to do. The decisions of the founder – provided they
aren’t too radical and destructive – actually make surprisingly little
difference.

Sound implausible? All over the world there are thousands of profitable
businesses that are ticking over very nicely despite average governance. No
doubt you will have come across many in your career. Has every employer of
yours been had brilliant managerial oversight? Unlikely. Do you think that
every billion dollar corporate is run by a team of gurus and savants? No way.

Businesses like these aren’t _guided_ by the decisions of management – they
_absorb_ them. Management are often like a flea riding an elephant; believing
they are controlling it when in reality it merely tolerates them
indifferently. In this world “impotent management” is the safest course of
action, not bold decisions. Just play it safe, keep things ticking over, and
everything will be OK. Which of course, is how most management is. _Business
evolution selects for the timid leaders_ ; the ones who don’t upset the
elephants.

So, does this mean management doesn’t matter? Not quite.

Just because it’s less significant than we think, that doesn’t mean that
terrible management can’t sink a business, or that brilliant management can’t
accelerate it.

What it does mean however is that the role of management is somewhat different
to what we think it is. Rather than management’s job being to “lead” or
“control” or “pilot” a company – the visionary cliche we typically associate
with the process – management’s true job is to listen to it, and follow it.

Great founders are _servants_ of their creations. They listen to what it
“wants” to be, and adapt their policies accordingly. They know that this path
is extremely unlikely to be the one they initially anticipated, or wanted to
follow. Eventually however their vision and that of their company will
synchronise, and accelerated growth will begin. That is brilliant management;
where the “leadership” shape themselves to their company, not their company to
them.

The classic example of this which I’ve mentioned before on these pages is
Facebook, where Mark Zuckerberg allowed things to evolve radically away from
his initial idea. He never led his company, he only followed it, and
eventually in his role of management, he learnt what it was for, and adjusted
his management accordingly – the opposite of “visionary leadership”.

We can say then that the essential quality of good management, and good
corporate governance, is humility. It is resisting the temptation to believe
that you have the power to dictate how a business will operate, and what
precisely it will become.

This is why the greatest entrepreneurs don’t need to be the greatest thinkers,
or [business strategists](https://basicarts.org), or forecasters. They just
have to be flexible and responsive. And, at least at the start, a bit lucky.

History will always celebrate the outliers; when a brilliant vision did indeed
come to pass. When a plan did indeed prove to be perfectly predictive. But the
fact that these are celebrated should prove just how rare they are.

In the real world you should lead your team, lead your employees, lead your
peers. But don’t lead your business. It already knows where it’s going.
