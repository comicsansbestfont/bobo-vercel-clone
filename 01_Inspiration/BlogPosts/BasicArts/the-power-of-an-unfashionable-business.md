There’s a theory in music which suggests, broadly speaking, that there have
been no significant new genres created since the advent of the internet.
Whilst no rock n’ roll song could ever have been written in the 40s, no disco
song could have been written in the 50s, and no grunge song could have been
written in the 70s, all songs we have today could have been written in the
90s. In other words, musical evolution has stalled. Now clearly many people
would vigorously dispute this claim, but that’s a conversation for another
time. What matters here is the principle behind this theory: namely that the
more information you can access, the less creative you become because of the
pull of fashion.

The way it works is that generic leaps are created by isolated communities
with limited access to other versions of their art form. Limited peer pressure
if you like. Because they don’t have anything to copy, their creativity takes
on far more original forms, whilst communities with lots to copy can’t help
but simply rehash what’s all around them. Nowadays, in our connected world,
there are virtually no pockets of “cultural poverty” from which original
expression can bloom, thus condemning music to an infinite cycle of remixes
and retro mash-ups from which it cannot escape. That’s the idea, and on paper
it’s a compelling one.

What I want to put forward here is that a similar thing has happened in
business, whereby our vast knowledge of industry norms and trends is
progressively narrowing the types of companies that get created.

Many of us are already somewhat aware of this clustering effect, at least
within specific categories. This is where the idea of “category norms” comes
from – tropes that businesses in a given sector tend to repeat and cluster
around, often for no good reason other than herd mentality. So for instance in
the world of condiments, if you look across the brands that populate it, there
is an almost blanket adherence to the benefits of “tradition” and “doing
things properly”, often manifested in psudeo-Victorian imagery and language.
Is there any reason why sauces can’t be modern and edgy? Not really, but it’s
not the norm so people tend not to think of it – and moreover they don’t even
realise they aren’t thinking of it. This is why breaking category norms can be
so effective; it enables you to be distinctive with very little effort. Method
are one of the most obvious examples of this approach, successfully producing
products like bleach and laundry detergent in attractive packaging that looks
more at home in a fragrance cabinet than the cleaning aisle. In hindsight it
seems an obviously a good idea – but it’s not easy to break a thought patter
everyone’s trapped in.

Now, profound as category norms are, we can take things a step further and
suggest that norms are now bleeding across categories. Different businesses in
entirely different sectors are starting to look more and more alike, not only
diminishing their distinctiveness but leading them to criminally underserve
vast chunks of their potential markets.

This process was pithily illustrated by Mark Ritson, [decrying the
unimaginative use of “brand
purpose”](https://www.marketingweek.com/2018/07/25/mark-ritson-brand-purpose-
contrived-data-hypocrisy/), one of the primary contributors to clustering:

_“Do you want to ‘inspire moments of optimism’ or ‘make today great’ or ‘get
more out of today’ or ‘inspire the human spirit’ or ‘make everyday life
better’ or ‘create a more positive future’? So much for differentiation if you
are Coke, Kellogg’s, Barclaycard, Ikea, Starbucks or Futurebrand.”_

All of these businesses are suffering a strong social pull to be a certain
way, to say certain things, to appeal to certain people – and it’s doubtful
they even realise that this process is happening, since it’s unlikely they’d
go along with it strategically if they did. Everywhere you care to look,
businesses are converging on the fashions of our time, becoming more tasteful,
more design-led, more performatively ethical, more urban, more healthy, and
more hipster-ish. This makeup is great now and again, but not when everyone is
doing it, as there are so many other ways for a business to be.

A brand that illustrates this perfectly – because it doesn’t fall into the
trap – is Monster energy drinks. Monster are a brand that, from a consumption
perspective, barely register on the radar of the taste-makers who control
business and media, primarily because they adhere to none of these tropes.
Their appeal is more, shall we say, “redneck”: very male, health-unconscious,
not necessarily urban, and un-idealistic. This alternative focus makes Monster
appear quite weird, not only by the standards of the beverage industry, but
business in general. They look like a throwback to the days of lads mags and
hot hatches; of Tango and Pot Noodle. Just look at this whole aesthetic:

They are relentlessly unfashionable. But that’s not the same thing as
unprofitable. [Monster have recently broken the $1billion net sales
barrier](https://www.fooddive.com/news/monster-reports-strong-sales-gains-but-
margin-pressures-persist/529727/); an extraordinary accomplishment you’d think
for a brand that supposedly serves a cultural “niche” nobody else bothers
with.

The truth here is that Monster are successful in large part not in spite of
being unfashionable, but because of it. There are no pastel colours or
promises to “make the everyday extraordinary” here, and that makes them stick
out like a sore thumb in modern context. This is something you’d perhaps
rather avoid as an individual, but as a brand it’s essential, since if you
can’t pass the noticeability threshold everything else after that is pointless
as nobody’s listening.

Not only that, Monster recognise that in real life most people themselves are
unfashionable. There are a lot of different kinds of people out there, but
many of them have few brands that culturally reflect them, whilst a handful
are courted by a disproportionate abundance. Of course, it’s not like people
shop exclusively in their “tribe” – the vast majority of brands are indistinct
enough to appeal to a broad cross-cultural swathe of people. But if you are
looking to create a company that is culturally relevant, as many these days
seek to do, then you can profit from looking past the fashionably dominant
culture.

The moral of the story then, is to pay a little more attention to what’s
uncool. Give your business a “fashion audit”, with the goal not being to
become more fashionable, more in line with the times, but less. Ask yourself
how strongly your product might appeal to anyone who isn’t an “experience
seeking millennial”, or “busy mum”. Try being a little less tasteful and a
little more tasteless. Stop learning from other people for a moment, and
incubate yourself from what Wired and Fast Company and Forbes are talking
about. Because, with businesses as with people, fashion is not how we express
our individuality – it’s how we hide it.
