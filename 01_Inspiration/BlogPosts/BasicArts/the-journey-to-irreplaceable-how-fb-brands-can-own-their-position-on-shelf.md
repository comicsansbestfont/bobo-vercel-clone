Coke famously started life as a pharmaceutical product. Tiffany’s was a
stationery store. Nokia, a paper mill.

Together they represent particularly acute examples of a truth that applies to
all companies:

_They evolve into something they didn’t intend._

Nobody knows this better than food and bev brands. It’s exceptionally rare for
an initial concept to succeed in the way the founder imagined. Instead, best-
laid plans quickly fly out the window, as you are forced to react to the
unpredictable feedback from retailers and consumers that your idea provokes –
not to mention the shifting cultural sands thrown into flux by a worldwide
pandemic.

For most brands, this reactivity becomes their day-to-day life.

They exist on the back foot, chasing competitors, experimenting with different
angles, and scrambling for traction in whatever way they can. They live in
constant fear of being copied, delisted, replaced, or undercut – and have to
work hard to make sure those things don’t happen.

But this doesn’t apply to everyone.

A select few businesses in F&B and elsewhere manage to break out of the
reactive dogfight, identify a clear and ownable strategy, and proactively
attack it in a way that separates them sharply from their competitors. These
are the brands that no supermarket would dare be without. They are, in the
minds of consumers, irreplaceable. They represent their categories and don’t
have adequate replacements. They’re the ones on the tip of everyone’s tongue,
endlessly repeated as case studies. They’re the brands who know exactly _what
they’re for_ , _what their role in the market is_ , _where they’re going_ and
_how they’re going to get there_.

I call them “strategic brands” – so-called because they operate to clear,
defensible, effective strategies, rather than being dragged into the
competitive dogfight.

Most never become strategic brands – not because they don’t have the
potential, but because _they are unaware of the path to get there_. I want to
show you this path; a process named “the strategic lifecycle”.

## The strategic lifecycle

The strategic lifecycle represents three stages of strategic maturity which
all companies need to pass through if they wish to develop clear propositions
which dominate their markets. This is especially true for F&B brands, which
have to deal with the dual markets of retailers and consumers. The vast
majority, not being aware of the stages, never leave the first – and remain
reactive (sometimes very successfully, it must be said) throughout their
entire existence.

Here is a brief description of the three stages:

**1 – Experimentation**

This is the first stage of any brand’s life, when it starts with a hypothesis
(like Coke and its pharmaceutical origins), and begins feeling its way through
the market like a caterpillar edging along a leaf.

At this juncture, you still aren’t sure what you’ve created, and so it makes
sense to not hold any direction too forcefully and to experiment with lots of
different things so that company can find its role.

In terms of food and drink brands, this might mean experimenting liberally
with different formats, flavours, and distribution channels. Most will fail,
some will not – and those will give you the necessary clues to pass on to the
next stage.

**2 – Consolidation**

Now, assuming you have survived and achieved a degree of success as a roving
caterpillar, it is time to enter your cocoon and consolidate the evidence your
experiments have gathered. What exactly is this thing you’ve created? Where
does the market want it? Where does it reject it? What kind of person does it
appeal to? Who does it turn off? What little, accidental, insignificant things
did you do which actually provoked a big response?

Providing you have achieved some traction, and some sales, you will be doing
something unique; something right.

The question is what? (If you want tips on figuring this out, see the link at
the end of this piece)

When you find the answer, codify it, and commit to it, you can enter the final
stage…

**3 – Acceleration**

Here finally you burst free from your cocoon – no longer a caterpillar but a
dazzling butterfly that stands out like a beacon in its market.

This has been achieved by synthesising the results of your experimental period
and extracting from them one concrete direction which represents the true
place your business fits in the market (rather than the one you imagined when
you began).

The entire process can be summarised by the immortal Dolly Parton line:

“Find out who you are, and do it on purpose”.

Note that she didn’t say choose who you are – you have no idea how the market
will respond to you, so it’s not for you to say. No, instead you must discover
the hidden and unintended potential of your business so that you can begin
attacking it with purpose and focus.

webinar I did with Young Foodies on the subject.  _This is a private link just
for readers of this article, it can’t be accessed on the open web._**

Throughout the video points are illustrated with a detailed case study of an
up and coming F&B brand who has passed through precisely this process.

Clearly it has not been the most stable year for any of us. For many brands it
has exposed confusion and vulnerability at the heart of their offerings – and
very few have emerged financially better off than they were last year.
However, it is precisely at such moments of chaos and flux that we are given
the opportunity to consolidate; to explore the questions mentioned above, and
expanded on in the webinar.

If you want to emerge from this period better than you entered it, then this
is the way – and I would be delighted to guide you, as I have many other high
growth grocery brands. Just drop me a note: alex@basicarts.org
