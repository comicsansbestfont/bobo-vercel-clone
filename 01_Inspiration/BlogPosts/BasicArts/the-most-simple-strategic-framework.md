I’ve made a song and dance in the past about my aversion to templates, models,
frameworks, and the like in order to generate strategy.

None, I believe, can be said to perfectly match every possible strategy – and
in some cases they can even drag people away from perfectly good solutions,
simply because they weren’t able to cram it into the (totally arbitrary) shape
the framework laid out.

However recently I was thinking about this, and I realised something: the
issue with frameworks is necessarily their templated nature. There’s nothing
inherently wrong with laying out information in an orderly “patterned” manner.
No, their issue instead is that they tend to assume a certain type of solution
by virtue of their wording. They try to hold your hand _just a little too
tightly_ , offering a _little too much guidance_ , and in doing so narrow your
options arbitrarily – ending up as your master, rather than your servant.

Examples of this include finding your “why”, which assumes the heart of any
strategy is your _reason_ for doing what you (sometimes it is, often it
isn’t), and any framework which gives you a sentence structure to fill in
(e.g. “GET-TO-BY” and the like).

This then made me wonder what a strategic framework would look like stripped
back to its very core, with no assumptions whatsoever – one that would fit
literally any strategy in any context, but would also help you generate it.

My suggestion, in its barest form, is this:

  1. Goal
  2. Strategy
  3. Actions

That’s it. On the face of things it probably looks pretty basic – too basic to
add any real value. However it has two key characteristics which give it
hidden power.

**The first is that prevents the two most common strategic sins, namely:**

  * Confusing goals with strategy
  * Creating strategies that don’t result in concrete action

When it comes to the first of these, we have all come across those appalling
cases where people say stuff like “our strategy is to double our sales” or
“our strategy is to become number one in our category”. Obviously these aren’t
strategies, these are goals. They are the things you need a strategy to
achieve. I’m pretty sure anyone reading this newsletter wouldn’t make such an
error, however you might make a similar one and say something like “our
strategy is to get young people to take cruises”, or “our strategy is to make
vaping cool”. If you look closely you will notice that these aren’t strategies
either – they are still goals. They are still things you wish to happen as a
result of your strategy. They are better goals than the ones I mentioned
earlier, since they are more narrow and specific – but they are _still goals_.
They still beg the question “ok, how?” – which a strategy should never do.

By explicitly separating goal and strategy, the framework prevents you from
slipping into the “goal as strategy” trap, and thus holds you to account.

As for the second of these sins – strategies that don’t result in concrete
action – naturally the bottom part of the framework sorts that out. A strategy
should always contain within it a handful of key actions which need to be
taken in order fulfil the strategy, and achieve the goal. These shouldn’t be
kicked down the road, as things to be “figured out later”. No, they need to be
as close to the heart of the strategy as possible – as close as the goal the
strategy is pointing at.

If you fill in this framework without actions, or with actions that aren’t
clear reflections of the strategy, it will immediately jar. Thus another trap
is avoided.

**So that’s it’s “defensive” power – what about it’s “offensive” potential. Is
it simply a tool of articulation, or can it help with our ideas too?**

Since my whole thinking with this was _not_ to assume a particular type of
strategic solution, it doesn’t guide you effortless to your destination.
You’re still going to have to do some thinking I’m afraid. However it does
have one little trick up its sleeve, and that’s what happens when you tackle
it _out of sequence_ , like this:

  1. Goal
  2. Actions
  3. Strategy

Now, doing things in this order, if you’re going to be purist about it, is
sacrilege. “How can you possibly come up with actions without a strategy?!”,
you may ask. And of course, officially speaking, you can’t.

But in the real world? Of course you can.

I regularly find on projects that I come up with effective executional ideas
before I come up with a strategy. Give someone a goal and they won’t typically
respond with a strategy. That’s too intellectually taxing, too abstract. No,
they’ll jump straight to ideas instead. They might say “hmm, wouldn’t it be
cool if we sold our product there”, or “imagine if we changed the packaging to
this”, or “wouldn’t this be a great NPD idea”. Such ideas are not necessarily
un-strategic. They have _rationales_ , however flimsy – and within these
rationales a great strategy may be lurking.

In the world of agencies this “reverse” process is commonplace (though hated
by strategists). I can recall many occasions in my old career when someone
would throw out a winning creative idea before a strategy was generated. The
human brain works like that – genius is quicker than methodical calculation.
When you got an idea like that, an idea everyone instinctively agreed was
great, the next question was why? Why did this work? And often by answering
that question you would reveal the strategy.

**Done in this order then, strategy becomes less a means of generating ideas
(although it will do that too), and more a way of _rationalising_ and _sense
checking_ them.**

Rather than coming up with a strategy “top down”, you instead do it “bottom
up”, by asking what the inherent strategy is of the actions you’ve come up
with. What do they all have in common as a group? How do I summarise them into
one thing? And of course most importantly, how do they achieve the goal?

If you can come up with an umbrella concept which ties the actions together,
and a strong rationale for why it works, then guess what – you’ve got a
strategy.

The fact you post rationalised it from executional ideas? Who cares.

Considering this, you might well ask why we even have the “strategy” section
of the framework at all. If we have our goal, and our actions to achieve the
goal, isn’t that enough?

Well in a practical sense, yes it is. Actions do the dirty work, so strictly
speaking they are the only thing you really “need”. However the strategy does
a couple of crucial jobs to support them:

  1. It pre-validates their effectiveness. You need to have a convincing argument as to why the ideas are going to work before you execute them, and the strategy should provide that for you.
  2. It unifies the actions into one thing. If you have, say, 10 actions, then it’s hard to communicate them in a coherent way. If however those actions can be summarised into a single idea, then it is easier for it to get purchase in the organisation, and for people to understand their responsibilities within it. And equally if the actions can’t be unified this way, then that suggests there is no focus behind them, and thus they are unlikely to be effective.
  3. It generates additional ideas. When an action has been framed as part of a wider strategy, you are able to then use the strategy to develop more actions – or indeed to improve the ones you already came up with.

Ultimately what you’re looking for is a completed framework where the strategy
acts as clear and memorable summary of the actions, and which in turn explains
quickly and succinctly just how you’re going to achieve your goal.

Dynamically we may illustrate it like this:

Don’t think you can go to far wrong with that.
