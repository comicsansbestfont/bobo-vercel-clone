In a way the core principle of strategy is that there are no shortcuts.

There are no obvious, off-the-peg, brainless things you can just “do” to get
competitive advantage. Everything requires some degree of thought, insight,
and risk.

But you know, that may not be strictly true.

Because I do believe there is one pretty easy cheat-code to creating something
people want to buy, which may cost a bit of money, but will repay you many
times over.

That thing?

**Beauty.**

Or, if you want to put it into more practical language: simply spend 3x more
on design and branding than any of your competitors.

Now understand, this game wouldn’t work in all categories. It wouldn’t work in
categories where the standard of aesthetic competition is already ridiculously
high, like soft drinks, sports cars, or sneakers.

But most industries aren’t like that. Most industries are boring, ugly, drab
things, where there is no beauty or flair to be found. This probably applies
to 80% of B2C industries, and 99% of B2B ones.

This means there is indeed an easy idiot-proof way of getting _some sort_ of
competitive advantage without any strategic thinking at all (_although
obviously if you overlay beauty on top of good strategy the results will
compound_).

Here are three reasons I think this technique works.

## I. Beauty stands out

Just ask the peacock: attracting attention ain’t that hard when you look damn
good. And for most businesses, attracting attention is half of the battle.
More than half even.

This means that even in a sea of undifferentiated commodified offerings, at
least you won’t _seem_ commodified. People won’t be able to rationalise why
you are different, or why they want you… and yet they do.

A good example of this is the cooler brand Yeti, which I have always lusted
after, even though I don’t really have any need for one. Are they any better
than the hundreds of other options out there? Not as far as I know. But I want
one anyway because they look like this:

Who needs strategy?!

## II. You’ll feel expensive

Beautiful, elegant, high-production-value things aren’t cheap to make – so
they aren’t cheap to buy either.

If you’re looking for a way to charge more, and improve your profit margins,
this is a pretty easy way to do it. It makes you the premium option even if
you don’t necessarily deserve that title. People will believe what they feel
when looking at you, not the “facts on the page”.

Just look at my client and collaborators, Pip Decks. They charge £150 for what
is essentially just a deck of cards. Sure, the value of the content may be way
higher, but if the thing looked like a dogs dinner nobody would be listening.
Instead however, it looks like this:

This is not a trivial factor in their success.

## III. It’s a one-off expense

Look, the obvious reason people don’t do this is because they don’t want to
throw money at top level designers and copywriters. It feels like overkill.
“Why should I spend £50,000 on this when I could get a perfectly good job done
for £5,000?”.

And that’s fair enough – until you consider that this is a _multiplier_ on
everything you do from that day forward.

You just have to grit your teeth. Do it once. And if you don’t have good taste
(which statistically you probably don’t), trust in the opinion of those who
do.

___

At the end of the day, we all know that buying stuff can be a pleasurable
experience.

We often get a feeling of _elevation_ , _completion_ , and _growth_ when we
hand over our cash for something we really want. It’s totally unjustified of
course, and largely short lived. But we get it anyway – and keep on chasing
the next hit.

Well, this feeling only really comes from buying beauty. From bringing
something into our lives which feels like it makes our existence a bit less
drab.

My pitch then is that this shouldn’t just apply to perfume and shoes.

It should apply to everything.

Dentistry.  
Legal services.  
Locksmiths.  
Everything.

Because beauty isn’t zero sum. It rewards everyone.
