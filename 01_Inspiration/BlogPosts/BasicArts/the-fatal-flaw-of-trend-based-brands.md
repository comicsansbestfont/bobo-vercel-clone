If you’re a founder, you probably got into the game partly through a desire
for freedom. Being your own boss and all that good stuff.

Central to this desire is a yearning for control. To be in control not only of
your time, but of your destiny. To incubate yourself from the arbitrary whims
of some random idiot. Sure, even as a founder, you’re never going to totally
avoid this issue. There will always be some gatekeeper (investor, buyer, etc.)
getting in your way. But in the big picture at least, you’re in charge. It’s
you, and you alone, who are responsible for your success or failure.

**Bearing this in mind then, I find it baffling just how many founders adopt
strategies which chuck this hard-earned freedom straight out the window.**

Rather than controlling their brand’s trajectory through the market – for
better or worse – they adopt a strategy which is fundamentally passive, and
leaves their fate totally to chance.

Sound like a bad idea? It is, but it’s also super common, and it all comes
down to this:

**Aligning your success to a trend.**

Many brands – especially in FMCG – come into being because their founder
noticed growing product or lifestyle trend. Plant-based, fermentation,
plastic-free, nootropics, CBD, you know the kind of thing, the list is
endless. On seeing this, they think (quite logically) “if I get in early here
then I’ll be able to ride the growth of this category straight to the top”. So
that’s just what they do: make a brand in the growing space, sit back, and
wait.

Seems like a good idea, but with one tiny flaw: what do you do if the
anticipated growth tsunami  _never_ comes?

Passive strategies like this, where brands wait to profit from a growing
trend, are suicidal. The problem is that only a  _tiny_ fraction of trends
ever breakthrough into becoming mainstream concepts. Industries which are
experiencing “triple digit growth” are normally doing so simply because they
only have triple digits of customers. And the qualities which help an idea get
traction with early adopters are often hinderances when it comes to wider
traction. (In other words something becoming popular in Planet Organic
ironically makes it  _less_ likely to succeed in Tesco, not more).

These quirky paradoxes seduce founders into gambling on ideas that are never
going to make it – and furnish brands which die slow painful deaths as they
wait years for the tide which never comes in.

**Now, I need to pause here and make an important qualification, because I
know that many of my readers run brands just like this, and the last thing I
want to do is dunk on their ideas.**

I am  _not_ saying that all brands who are tapping into a new trend are
doomed. On the contrary tapping into such trends is great. I am simply saying
that the ones who adopt a passive “wait for the trend to get big” strategy are
doomed. And unfortunately that’s most of them.

Creating a brand in a growing or nascent market is great  _provided_ you make
sure you do so in a manner whereby you maintain control of your destiny,
rather than leaving it to chance.

How?

**It’s simple: you must develop a strategy which assumes your category will
never take off.**

You must build your brand as if the wider trend was a total dud, that will be
forgotten in 5 years.

You see all these trend-based products have two sides to them. One side, the
obvious and passive one, is the side which is tied to the wider concept. Will
this “thing” ever take off? Will it become a mainstream concern? The answer to
this is generally “no”. The other side however has more potential: what is
this thing  _in and of itself_? What does it do, objectively, for consumers?
How can we sell it from first principles, to someone who’s never heard of it?
You see there’s a massive difference between selling a product off the back of
a trend, and selling it on its own merits.

Let’s say you have, I don’t know, a CBD chocolate company. (I’m sure thousands
of these exist already). On the one hand you can try to sell this on the back
of the wider CBD trend: the more popular CBD becomes, the more popular your
chocolate becomes. That’s the bad strategy. On the other hand you could ask
“what if we were the only CBD product in the world? What if we’d literally
invented CBD, and put it in a chocolate? How would we sell it then? How would
we sell it without leaning on the reputation of the category?”. This is the
thinking that will unlock a good strategy.

Pretending that you invented the trend, and selling it from first principles
like this has double benefit. First you have a strategy which is separate from
the fate of the category, and which you control. And second, if the category
does take off in its own right, you will  _still_ be able to profit from it
anyway – even more so in fact because you will have a differentiated position
from all the other passive brands.

Ultimately my general position has always been that the world and the markets
within it change far less than we think they do. Walk around any supermarket
and in truth it’s 95% the same as it was in 1992. The fact that we all came of
age in a period of flux as the world adjusted to the internet has tricked us
into thinking that change is the natural order of things, but from a business
point of view it isn’t – stasis is.

So please, don’t tie your fate to macro changes that may never happen. Make a
company that is fit for the world as it is  _today_. Because more than likely,
that’s what will be fit for the world tomorrow too.
