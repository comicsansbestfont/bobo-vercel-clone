Market Size and International Expansion
The total number of known mining companies & contractor is under 7K
International expansion is unproven
Imdex has heavy distribution muscle to sell Krux
Current ACV with proven GTM in AU gives TAM of 45M
Competitive Advantage Against Incumbents: There is a clear need to communicate your competitive advantage over companies like Imdex, especially in international markets. You need to convey your unique value proposition that will convince customers to prefer CorePlan over the incumbent players.
Retention and Growth: VCs have expressed concerns about growth rates and retention metrics. CorePlan's growth and efficiency metrics seem to be falling short of what investors typically look for. Improving your customer retention and growth rates might make your business more attractive to potential investors.
Sales Cycle and Scaling: Concerns have been raised about your sales cycle and the staffing needed to scale the business. You may need to demonstrate strategies to shorten the sales cycle and show that you can scale the business without proportional staffing increases.
Platform Opportunity: SquarePeg didn’t see a clear platform opportunity and believed CorePlan should demonstrate a way to expand into a wider range of uses beyond its current offering. They used the example of ProCore, which started as document management and expanded into other uses such as staffing, site data, and financing.
Revenue Dynamics and Traction: Some investors have concerns about the velocity of revenue growth and the traction in the exploration customer segment. They believe the exploration segment is more important for future growth and would like to see more success in this area.
Cyclicality of the Market: Five V was concerned about the cyclicality of the market that CorePlan operates in. This suggests they see too much volatility or uncertainty in the industry which may affect the profitability of CorePlan.
