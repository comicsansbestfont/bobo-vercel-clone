Strengths
Brand, GTM, foothold in AUS
Flexibility of data model allowing us to build on MVP workflows
Responsiveness to customer requests (we say yes because of capability above)
Customers are choosing us over key competitor offering, due to user experience, UI, service and product capabilities. 
Agile small team, quicker decisions and very close to customers strong relationships and fast product research. 
Demand generation and capture globally to attract use case champions
SWOT
Opportunities
Need for measure while drilling, integrations and custom analytics being signalled by market with others not being able to deliver. 
Interest from customers to start on other key workflows adjacent to current offering that 1) help strengthen and deliver our brand promise 2) further differentiate from competition 3) allowing to increase ARR and customer retention.
Imdex customers in market due to EOL of reflex hub
Forming alliances with neighbouring tech / integrations
Inbound interest from companies wanting to represent CorePlan. Is it even worth it exploring? Are we better off starting with initial local internal staff member in key regions before exploring and then scaling?
Weaknesses
Growing fast without proper processes in place, team has limited capacity and capability to scale yet
Delivery is slow with a huge roadmap because it is enterprise, mining, dual stakeholders, multiplied by complex mining workflows and number of personas.
New product vs delivery separation starting to become a need as per above
Scaling and replicating key business functions across, sales, onboarding, implementations and product
Captured demand is converting but slowly due to new staff ramping up that also require understanding both mining and enterprise buying process
Limited geographic reach - No capability to land, acquire and onboard in offshore markets at scale hence losing customers that require local coverage and touch -e.g. on above two MMG
Perth market is challenging to find experienced talent especially suitable for B2B enterprise saas play especially in product, marketing, and engineering
Threats
Competitors copying us, new and existing e.g. rock-it, acquire
Krux new CRO ex vp data management Sequent with good relationships
Pipeline doesn’t convert to sale due to sales capability in newly hired staff
Imdex play with Krux they have presence to acquire offshore markets because of the vacuum, no competitors, we are not there
Dependent on small team, hindering capability to serve large implementations such as Barrick and Maaden
Staff burnout, Staff burn out, staff burnout
Remuneration pressure from market risks of staff churn, morale and operating costs 
We can’t deliver on all the things customers need to avoid churn
Customers churning due to outgrowing mvp product.
Enterprise and key accounts failing implementation and leading to churn due to slow enterprise grade product delivery.
