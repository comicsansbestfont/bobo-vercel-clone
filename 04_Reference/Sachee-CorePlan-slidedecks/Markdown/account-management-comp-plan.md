When NRR is positive, growth accelerates much faster, and it reduces the need for more new logos.

Positive NRR = more predictable revenue, greater efficiency, and higher profitability.

Positive NRR shows that clients are receiving value from our product and are invested in our long term partnership.

A strong NRR helps us build long-term recurring revenue and predictable business outcomes.
NRR = Sustainable Growth
