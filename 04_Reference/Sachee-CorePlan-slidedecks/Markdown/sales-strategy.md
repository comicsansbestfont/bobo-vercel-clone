Facts and learnings

High-Value, Technically Complex Deals
Navigate web of stakeholders
Address varied priorities and concerns

Persona-Based Outreach Falls Short
Our ops are unique
Complexity of stakeholder ecosystem
Need for site-specific, not just role-specific, approach

"Spray and Pray" Doesn't Work
Mining industry too specialized
Each account represents significant investment
Long, Complex Sales Cycles
If right stakeholders are not involved
No sales process followed 
No business case presented
Not enough stakeholders
Progressing without need
Thinking the champion has power
Establish differentiation early on
Lead, don’t take orders
Set expectations
Speed and prospect experience is our weapon
Help the buyer, educate, inform and challenge where necessary
