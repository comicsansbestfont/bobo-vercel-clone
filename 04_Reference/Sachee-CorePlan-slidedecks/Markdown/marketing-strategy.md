## Slide 5

Background

High-Value, Technically Complex Deals
Navigate web of stakeholders
Address varied priorities and concerns

Persona-Based Outreach Falls Short
Our ops are unique
Complexity of stakeholder ecosystem
Need for site-specific, not just role-specific, approach

Traditional GTM models Doesn't Work
Mining industry too specialized
Each account represents significant investment

Software and SaaS is foreign
Older generation scared of change or how to use
Thinks of us as consultancies
Rise of Millenials and Gen Z brining on technology or using tools like Monday to internal ops

Imdex & Krux Acquisition providing education to market but also driving confusion of what’s ‘better’

Competitors brand new and existing software trying to move across

Enterprise Account have long sales cycles and Juniors are not reliable

Drilling Contractors are and collaboration with them KEY to everyone’s success

## Slide 6

We’re already killing it in Australia. now it’s time to take that heat global.

## Slide 7

Platform
Product Suite
Legacy on Prem
Next Gen Cloud

## Slide 8

Krux currently leads the market, followed by competitors such as Blackfox in the Americas and smaller localised players like Colleagues matrix. While these competitors have significant market presence, we can differentiate ourselves by positioning ourselves as a Mining Saas, High touch Implementation, Support and Experience

## Slide 10

Krux’s strengths lie in Imdex’s brand recognition, established customer base, extensive distribution, and substantial resources. However, they struggle with software flexibility, ease of use, innovation speed, and personalized customer support. 
We can capitalize on these weaknesses by emphasizing our agile, user-friendly SaaS approach, targeting dissatisfied prospects, and positioning ourselves as industry thought leaders. Nevertheless, we must not slack and be prepared to Krux’s potential aggressive marketing and strategic pivots.

## Slide 12

Where We Stand
Australia loves us—brand awareness is high, and we’re scoring through sales outreach, inbound, and viral loops. Elsewhere its very low.
LinkedIn ads from last year are fading; maybe audience burnout or weak landing pages.
Website’s solid, converting organics and ads (embedded demos working). Blogs are yesterday now 
Events, creating leads but not the conversion. Great for pushing deals along but that’s about it. I’ve slacked and need to bring back the focus on focus with target accounts and event orchestration.
Product Launches and Social are just starting but changelog has been a hit but socials we need to do less but with more coordination.

## Slide 13

Marketing Staretgy
Laser-focus on high-value accounts via 1:1 ABM plays in ANZ, Americas, and Africa.
Fix LinkedIn ads for unaware audiences; test if FB drives better retargeting if they fit. Split enterprise vs mid market
Revive the podcast to drive Community with miners and drillers 
Repurpose existing Content and fill gaps to educate the market on SaaS and modern drilling management.
Be present at Industry Events and orchestrate according to tier 1 accounts.
Coordinate holistically across all ads, socials, events, focused on ABM / content narrative

This is key. Having the consistency across all.
