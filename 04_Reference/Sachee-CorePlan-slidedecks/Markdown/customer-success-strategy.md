## Slide 4

Background

High-Value, Technically Complex Workflows
Navigate web of stakeholders
Address varied priorities and concerns

Previous attempts have not worked leading to silos
Manual Workflows
Legacy software
Custom built solutions

Software and SaaS is foreign
Older generation scared of change or how to use
Thinks of us as consultancies
Rise of Millenials and Gen Z brining on technology or using tools like Monday to internal ops

Imdex & Krux Acquisition providing education to market but also driving confusion of what’s ‘better’

Competitors brand new and existing software trying to move across

Enterprise Account have long sales cycles and Juniors are not reliable

Drilling Contractors are and collaboration with them KEY to everyone’s success

What is Customer Success?

## Slide 13

Facts and Learnings

One size fits all is a myth
Our ops are unique
Complexity of stakeholder ecosystem
Need for an account specific

Customers don’t self-learn
For implementations customers do NOT self learn
We have to handhold the customer to
Speed and clarity to all
Implementations go off track if there’s no structured development

Adoption dies if we don’t “meet the customer where they’re at”

Speed and prospect experience are our weapons

Hold the customer’s hand to educate, inform and challenge where necessary

Customers who move at their own pace this can hurt our implementation.
