Background

High-Value, Technically Complex Workflows

Older generation scared of change or how to use
Thinks of us as consultancies

Imdex & Krux Acquisition providing education to market but also driving confusion of what’s ‘better’

Competitors brand new and existing software trying to move across

Enterprise Account have long sales cycles and Juniors are not reliable

Drilling Contractors are and collaboration with them KEY to everyone’s success
