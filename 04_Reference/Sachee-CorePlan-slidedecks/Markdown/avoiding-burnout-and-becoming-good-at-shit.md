## Slide 1

Moving between strategy & tactics for a single topis is generally not taxing, and often happens naturally whilst increasing expertise.

## Slide 2

Moving between one topic and another, but staying at the same depth of thinking or doing, starts to be taxing because it requires a little context-switching. You can reduce the tax by reducing the number of times you switch topics over a period of time. (day vs week)

## Slide 3

The more often you switch topics and the more topics you cover,
the more taxing it becomes, but staying at the same depth reduces the tax.

## Slide 4

The hardest switch is to change topic AND depth. Even a single move can be
quite taxing, and you lose a lot of momentum when you make a move like this. Especially if this is new area to you.

## Slide 5

Once you start jumping around topics and depth, it can be hard to
subsequently move among depths OR topics. This is one sure way to burn yourself out and not really produce anything you vould be proud of. When learning something new focusing on one topic or super closely related is the key to getting good at shit and avoiding burnout.
