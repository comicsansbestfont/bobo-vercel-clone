## Slide 1

Building a rocketship and going to the moon
fucking 
spiders
🚀🌕
👉👌
🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️

## Slide 2

What does the moon look like?

## Slide 3

Be the hubspot of mining. This means building a platform & a community that solves real problems for the mining industry across the entire process, end to end.

Right now we only cover the exploration (and resource estimation) process. And this is what we need to get really good at. This our niche. This is our wedge.

The wedge to open the door to discovery, development, production and closure. If we choose to.

## Slide 4

Looking Back
Put inplace foundations and framework for better customer experience. Albeit a bit scrappy.
The Iceberg
Customer centric Product, Customer & Market alignment
Validation on niche; outreach & brand

## Slide 5

MRR
Customer sentiment
😍 67%
😐 18%
😞 15%
Pipeline

## Slide 6

This is a partnership
🤝

## Slide 7

What are our individual skills and areas of expertise?
What can we contribute to the business that’s going to help us get to the moon, together?

## Slide 8

We work best when
Sales Synergy
Decisions quickly
Alex comes up with product and technical, Sachee scales
Hustle

## Slide 9

We work best when
You own, guide & run product development based on the sales, market, customer feedback
We have cadence to a plan & process.
But with reflection and iteration, together.
You crack the whip on the board
Picking up clients at events.
Tag teaming on sales.

## Slide 10

We have friction when
Where Alex finishes and Sachee starts & vice versa
Alex dosnt understand what Scahee does, because of things in the shadows.
Google Drive VS Office
Overselling - without setting expectations

## Slide 11

We have friction when
Promise without scoping
Overlay traditional business practises into SaaS without thinking it through
Sit on something for too long without acting
Make decisions without investigation
Don’t communicate
Don’t communicate

## Slide 12

How DO we get to the moon?
How do we become a “unicorn”.
Is this even important?

## Slide 13

We need to get better at doing what we do best.
