# 10 Mistakes to Avoid When Angel Investing

**Speaker:** Cheryl Mack (CEO, Aussie Angels)
**Event:** West Tech Fest
**Date:** December 2024

## Introduction

Cheryl Mack opens by admitting that she has made most of these mistakes herself. The goal of the talk is to help investors avoid common pitfalls so they can build a profitable and impactful portfolio without learning the hard way.

## 1. Investing Without a Clear Strategy

Many new investors start by writing checks because a friend is doing it or they "like the guy," without a broader plan. This makes it impossible to know if you are successful later or how to make subsequent decisions.

**The Fix:** You don't need an academic thesis, but you need a basic framework.

**Key Components of a Strategy:**
1. **Time Horizon:** This is a long-term asset class. Are you building for returns in 5, 10, or 15 years?
2. **Goals:** Are you an **Impact Investor** (funding specific causes like climate tech) or a **Financial Investor** (purely chasing returns)? Most angels are a mix of both.
3. **Portfolio Size:** You generally need to aim for a minimum of 20 companies to de-risk (see Mistake #3).
4. **Focus Areas:** Define your sectors, stage (Pre-seed/Seed vs. later), and business models.
5. **Check Size:** Calculate your total allocation divided by the number of companies you plan to back.

## 2. Writing Big "First Cheques"

New investors often put large amounts of capital into their first 1-3 deals because they are excited.

**The Reality:** The first few investments are often the ones investors regret later as they refine their taste. These are called **"Learning Cheques."**

**The Fix:** Write smaller cheques at the beginning. Learn from the process without exposing too much capital. Save your larger cheques for when you have more experience and data.

---

## 3. Failing to Understand Probabilities

Cheryl uses a "Casino Game" analogy (rolling dice) to explain risk. In a single roll of the dice, you might lose everything. However, if you play the game 100 times, the **Expected Value** starts to materialize.

**The Insight:** Startup investing is a numbers game. Any single company has a high probability of failure. You must invest in enough companies (play the game enough times) to let the probabilities work in your favor.

---

## 4. Trying to "Pick Winners"

Investors often suffer from the fallacy that they can predict exactly which company will succeed. This leads to "picking" one or two favorites and stopping there.

**The Power Law:** Returns in venture capital follow a Power Law distribution (Correlation Ventures data):
- **64%** of companies return 0-1X (Loss or break-even)
- **~30%** do okay (1-10X)
- **~6%** generate the vast majority of profits (10X - 20X+)

**The Reality:** Nobody actually knows who the winners will be at the early stage. (e.g., Airbnb was rejected by everyone; Canva was rejected until Bill Tai came along).

**The Fix:** Don't try to snipe the single winner. Instead, place "Good Bets" that fit your strategy and play the volume game.

---

## 5. Neglecting Due Diligence

Investing on a whim, a conversation, or hype without reading the paperwork.

**The Risk:** Signing documents you don't understand can lead to bad terms (e.g., getting diluted out later).

**Key Terms to Learn:**
- SAFE notes
- Priced Equity
- Valuation Caps
- Pre-money vs. Post-money valuation

**The Fix:** Even if following a syndicate lead, you must understand the basic terms of what you are signing. Read the "Subscription Agreement" or "Funding Docs."

---

## 6. Doing *Too Much* Due Diligence

The inverse of Mistake #5. This occurs when an angel writes a small cheque (e.g., $10k) but demands 10 meetings and endless spreadsheets from the founder.

**The Problem:**
1. **Slowing the founder down:** You want them building the business, not managing you.
2. **Reputation:** Founders talk. If you are high-friction for low capital, you won't get into good deals later.

**The Fix:** Find a balance. If you are a small check, rely on the lead investor's diligence or do "light" diligence. Be respectful of the founder's time.

---

## 7. Ignoring Founder Quality

Investors often get distracted by the product, the market size, or the "idea."

**The Insight:** At the Pre-seed/Seed stage, the product will change, and the market might shift. The only constant is the team.

**The Question to Ask:** Do I believe *this* person can grow into the leader of an 8,000-person global company? Do they have the grit and execution ability?

**The Fix:** Prioritize founder capability over the current iteration of the product.

---

## 8. Running Out of Money (Poor Capital Deployment)

This happens when investors deploy all their cash during "hype cycles" (like 2020-2021) and have no "dry powder" left when the market cools or when their portfolio companies need follow-on funding.

**The Problem:**
1. You can't support your winners in later rounds.
2. You can't take advantage of better valuations during market downturns.

**The Fix:** **Dollar Cost Averaging.** Pace yourself. Don't invest 20 times in one year and 0 the next. Spread your investing over a 2-3 year deployment period to smooth out market highs and lows.

---

## 9. Being Too Passive

Writing the check and vanishing.

**The Problem:** Feedback loops in angel investing are very long (5-10 years). If you disengage, you don't learn anything during that wait time.

**The Fix:**
- Read the investor updates.
- Offer help where you can.
- Stay engaged with the journey so you understand *why* the company is succeeding or failing.

---

## 10. Failing to Reflect and Learn

Not tracking why you made decisions.

**The Fix:** Maintain a **"Decision Diary."**
- When you invest, write down: Your emotional state, your thesis, the time of day, and why you said "Yes."
- **The Anti-Portfolio:** Track why you said "No" to companies.
- Review these notes years later when the company exits or fails. This is the only way to calibrate your judgment and improve your "gut feel" over time.

## Key Takeaway

Angel investing is a long-term game of probabilities. Success comes from having a strategy, being consistent, managing your capital pace, and focusing on the quality of founders rather than trying to predict the future.
