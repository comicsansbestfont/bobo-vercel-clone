## Key Concept: Operator-Advisor-Investor Model

Unlike pure angels, this strategy leverages the advisory practice:

- **Advisory = Due Diligence** - 3-6 months of working together beats any reference call
- **Three Exposure Types** - Cash investment, equity-for-advisory, or hybrid
- **Invest After Advisory** - Default policy: no cash until 3+ months of working together
- **Smaller Portfolio OK** - 10-15 companies (not 20+) because I'm actively improving outcomes

## Advisory Synergy

- Proprietary deal flow through advisory clients
- Lower diligence burden (I already know the founders)
- Value-add beyond capital (GTM expertise)
- Skin in the game builds credibility
