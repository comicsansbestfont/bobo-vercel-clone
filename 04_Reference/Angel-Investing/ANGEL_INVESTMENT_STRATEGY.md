# Angel Investment Strategy: Sachee Perera

**Version:** 1.1
**Created:** December 2025
**Updated:** December 2025 (added Operator-Advisor-Investor model)
**Review Date:** June 2026
**Source Framework:** Cheryl Mack's "10 Mistakes to Avoid" + Sachee's Valuation Methodology + Operator-Investor Adaptation

---

## 1. Strategic Parameters

### Capital Allocation

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Total Sleeve | $125,000 AUD | Dedicated angel allocation |
| Deployment Period | 3 years (2025-2028) | Dollar cost averaging; avoid deploying during single market cycle |
| Annual Budget | ~$40K/year | Paced deployment to smooth market highs/lows |
| Target Portfolio | 15-20 companies | Minimum for probability math to work |

### Cheque Sizes

| Type | Amount | When to Use |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Learning Cheques | $2,500 - $5,000 | First 5-8 investments; calibrating judgment |
| Standard Cheques | $10,000 | Post-calibration; high-conviction bets |
| Follow-on Reserve | 20% of sleeve ($25K) | Pro-rata in winners' subsequent rounds |

### Implied Portfolio Math

- 8 learning cheques @ $3,750 avg = $30K
- 10 standard cheques @ $10K = $100K
- Follow-on reserve built into the above
- **Total: ~18 companies across the sleeve**

## 2. Investment Thesis

### Who I Back

**Primary Focus:** AU/NZ vertical SaaS founders in under-digitised industries

| Criteria | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Geography | Australia, New Zealand, APAC (Sri Lanka diaspora founders included) |
| Sector | Vertical SaaS in construction, mining, trades, heavy industry, hospitality |
| Stage | Pre-seed to Seed (Phase 1a-1b in my framework) |
| Business Model | B2B SaaS with recurring revenue potential |
| Founder Profile | Technical founders who need GTM help; domain experts building for their industry |

### Why This Thesis

This is where I have unfair advantage:

1. I've built GTM engines in these exact industries (CorePlan, Sidekicker, UberEATS)
2. I sell to "people in steel-capped boots" - I understand the buyer
3. My advisory practice creates proprietary deal flow
4. I can add value beyond capital (GTM help, hiring, operational rhythm)

---

## 3. Investment Gates

### Minimum Requirements (Hard Gates)

Based on my existing valuation framework, a company must meet these to be considered:

| Gate | Threshold | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Founder Engine Score | ≥ 3.0 (learning cheque) / ≥ 3.5 (standard cheque) | My weighted assessment of founder capability |
| Problem Clarity | Clear, specific problem articulation | Not "boiling the ocean" |
| Early Signal | At least 1 paying customer OR strong LOIs | Some evidence of willingness to pay |
| Valuation Alignment | Within 50% of my framework output | Founder expectations grounded in reality |
| Runway | ≥ 6 months post-investment | Not a bridge to nowhere |

### Soft Factors (Tiebreakers)

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Advisory relationship exists | High - I know the founder deeply |
| Domain expertise in my sectors | High |
| Technical founder + GTM gap I can fill | High |
| Repeat founder | Medium |
| Strong co-investor / lead | Medium |

---

## 4. Decision Framework

### The "Good Bet" Test

Instead of trying to pick winners, ask: **"Is this a good bet given my thesis?"**

A Good Bet meets these criteria:

1. Fits my thesis (sector, stage, geography)
2. Passes hard gates
3. Founder I'd want to work with for 10 years
4. Valuation is reasonable for the stage
5. I can add value beyond capital

### Learning Cheque Exception

A $2.5-5K learning cheque can be written when:

- Founder Engine Score ≥ 3.0 (below standard 3.5 threshold)
- I'm doing active advisory work with them
- High coachability demonstrated
- Clear path to hitting standard gates in 6-12 months
- I want to learn something specific (new sector, new geography, new model)

---

## 5. Due Diligence Protocol

### For Learning Cheques ($2.5-5K)

**Light diligence** - rely on advisory relationship:

- [ ] Review my existing valuation analysis
- [ ] Confirm cap table is clean
- [ ] Read the SAFE/docs (understand terms)
- [ ] 1 reference call (if I don't know founder well)

**Time budget:** 2-4 hours max

### For Standard Cheques ($10K)

**Moderate diligence:**

- [ ] Full valuation analysis (already doing this for advisory clients)
- [ ] Cap table review
- [ ] 2-3 reference calls (customers, former colleagues)
- [ ] Understand use of funds
- [ ] Review any existing investor updates

**Time budget:** 8-12 hours

### Terms I Need to Understand

| Term | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| SAFE vs Priced Round | Know what I'm signing |
| Valuation Cap | My effective entry price |
| Pre vs Post-money | Dilution calculation |
| Pro-rata rights | Can I follow on? |
| Information rights | Will I get updates? |

---

## 6. Portfolio Management

### Engagement Level

**Not passive.** For every investment:

- Read every investor update
- Respond to asks within 48 hours
- Offer 1 specific help per quarter (intro, feedback, resource)
- Track key metrics in decision diary

### Follow-on Framework

| Trigger | Action | Max Allocation |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Company hitting milestones + raising at fair terms | Exercise pro-rata | Up to $10K per follow-on |
| Breakout performer (top 10% of portfolio) | Consider super pro-rata | Up to $15K |
| Flat/struggling but still believe in founder | Pass on follow-on | $0 |
| Down round / pivot | Case-by-case; usually pass | $0 |

**Follow-on Reserve Rules:**
- $25K total reserved for follow-ons
- Only follow companies in top 30% of portfolio
- Never follow-on just to "average down"
- Prioritize companies where I'm actively adding value

### Portfolio Tracking

Maintain a simple tracker with:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Company | Name |
| Investment Date | When |
| Amount | How much |
| Instrument | SAFE/Equity |
| Valuation Cap | Entry price |
| Current Status | Active / Acquired / Failed / Zombie |
| Last Update | When I last heard from them |
| My Value-Add | What I've contributed |

---

## 7. Decision Diary

Per Cheryl Mack's Mistake #10 - this is how I calibrate judgment over time.

### When I Invest - Record:

```markdown
## [Company Name] - Investment Decision
**Date:**
**Amount:**
**Emotional State:** (Excited / Calm / FOMO / Skeptical but convinced)
**Time of Day:** (Morning clarity vs. late-night enthusiasm)

### Why I Said Yes
1.
2.
3.

### Thesis Fit
- [ ] Sector match
- [ ] Stage match
- [ ] Founder profile match

### Concerns I'm Accepting
1.
2.

### What Would Make Me Wrong
1.
2.

### Expected Outcome (5-year view)
- Base case:
- Bull case:
- Bear case:
```

### Review Cadence

- **Quarterly:** Skim decision diary, note any pattern changes
- **Annually:** Deep review - which decisions aged well? Which didn't? Why?
- **At Exit:** Full post-mortem - was my thesis right? Did concerns materialize?

---

## 8. Anti-Portfolio

Track companies I said "No" to and why. This is the only way to learn from misses.

### Template:

```markdown
## [Company Name] - Pass Decision
**Date:**
**What They Were Raising:**
**Valuation:**

### Why I Said No
1.
2.
3.

### What Would Change My Mind
1.
2.

### Revisit Trigger
- [ ] Check back in [X months] if they hit [milestone]
```

### Annual Anti-Portfolio Review

- Which passes turned into winners? What did I miss?
- Which passes were correct? What signal was I reading?
- Am I passing on a pattern I should reconsider?

---

## 9. Exit Expectations

### Time Horizon

- **Minimum hold:** 5 years (illiquid asset class)
- **Expected hold:** 7-10 years
- **Planning horizon:** 10 years (2025-2035)

### Returns Math (Power Law Reality)

Based on industry data (Correlation Ventures):

| Outcome | % of Portfolio | Expected Count (18 cos) | Return |
|---------|----------------|------------------------|--------|
| Total loss (0X) | 50% | 9 companies | $0 |
| Return capital (1X) | 15% | 3 companies | ~$20K |
| Modest return (2-5X) | 25% | 4-5 companies | ~$60K |
| Strong return (10X+) | 10% | 1-2 companies | $75K-$150K |

**Expected total return:** 1.5-2.5X over 10 years (if I pick "good bets")

### What Success Looks Like

- **Financial:** Return the $125K sleeve + modest profit ($50-100K)
- **Learning:** Calibrated judgment for larger cheques in future
- **Network:** Relationships with 15-20 founders I respect
- **Reputation:** Known as helpful, low-friction angel in AU/NZ vertical SaaS

### What Failure Looks Like

- Lose >50% of sleeve with no learning
- Zero follow-on opportunities (wasn't helpful enough)
- Deployed too fast during a bubble
- Backed founders outside my thesis (FOMO)

---

## 10. Advisory Synergy

### How Investing Integrates with Advisory Practice

| Advisory Touchpoint | Investment Angle |
|---------------------|------------------|
| GTM Diagnostic clients | Proprietary deal flow; I know them deeply |
| GTM Advisory retainer clients | Ongoing relationship = lower diligence burden |
| Founders I meet at events | Top of funnel for both advisory and investment |
| Portfolio companies | Potential advisory upsell if they need more help |

### Conflict Management

- **Disclosure:** Always disclose if I'm considering investment during advisory
- **No pay-to-play:** Advisory fee and investment are separate decisions
- **Advisory-first:** Default to advisory relationship; investment is bonus, not goal
- **Clear boundaries:** Don't let small investment create outsized advisory expectations

### Value-Add Playbook

What I can actually offer portfolio companies:

| Help Type | My Capability | When to Offer |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| GTM strategy | Primary expertise | Always |
| First sales hire profile | Done it multiple times | When they're ready to hire |
| Pricing | Framework exists | When they're confused |
| Founder coaching | Operational experience | When they're struggling |
| Intros to buyers | Network in mining, hospitality, trades | When relevant |
| Intro to other investors | Growing network | For follow-on rounds |

---

## 12. The Operator-Advisor-Investor Model

This section addresses how Cheryl Mack's pure angel framework translates to my specific situation as an operator-advisor who actively works with portfolio companies.

### How My Model Differs from Pure Angel Investing

| Pure Angel | Operator-Advisor-Investor (Me) |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| Pays cash for access | Gets paid (or earns equity) for access |
| Due diligence = weeks of research | Due diligence = months of working together |
| Passive after investment | Actively shaping outcomes |
| Needs 20-40 bets for diversification | Advisory clients ARE diversification |
| "Learning cheques" cost money | Learning happens through advisory (free) |
| Bet on founders, hope they figure it out | Bet on founders AND help them figure it out |
| Returns = founder × market luck | Returns = founder × market luck × my GTM contribution |

### The Core Insight

**My advisory portfolio IS my angel portfolio's deal flow and due diligence pipeline.**

I'm essentially getting paid to source and vet deals that traditional angels pay to access. The $125K cash sleeve becomes a *selective overlay* - doubling down on founders I've already battle-tested through advisory.

### Three Types of Exposure

| Exposure Type | What It Is | When to Use |
|---------------|------------|-------------|
| **Cash Investment** | Traditional angel cheque | Post-advisory validation; proven founders |
| **Equity-for-Advisory** | Sweat equity in exchange for GTM work | Pre-revenue; they need time more than money |
| **Hybrid** | Small cash cheque + advisory equity | Early revenue; hedging while staying engaged |

### Advisory Stage → Investment Mapping

| Client Stage | ARR Range | My Role | Preferred Exposure | Cash Investment |
|--------------|-----------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Phase 1a** (Pre-revenue) | $0 | Heavy lift - building foundations | Equity-for-advisory | Learning cheque only ($2.5-5K) if cash-rich founder |
| **Phase 1b** (Early revenue) | $1-$50K | Active GTM build | Hybrid | Standard cheque ($5-10K) once gates met |
| **Phase 2** (Growth) | $50K-$200K | Scaling what works | Cash investment | Higher conviction ($10K+) |
| **Phase 3** (Scale) | $200K+ | Optimisation | Cash retainer client | Likely priced out for angel; different vehicle |

### Equity-for-Advisory Guidelines

For pre-revenue companies where cash investment is highest risk:

| Engagement Type | Equity Range | Rationale |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| GTM Diagnostic (one-off) | 0.1-0.25% | Light touch, limited ongoing involvement |
| 3-month sprint | 0.25-0.5% | Meaningful contribution, time-bound |
| 6-month advisory | 0.5-1.0% | Deep engagement, ongoing value |
| Fractional GTM lead (ongoing) | 1.0-2.0% | Significant time commitment, co-building |

**When equity-for-advisory makes more sense than cash:**
- They need my time more than my money
- My contribution directly improves the outcome
- I'm not burning cash on highest-risk stage
- I'll be deeply engaged anyway through advisory

### Revised Parameters for Operator-Investor Model

| Parameter | Pure Angel (Cheryl) | My Operator-Investor Model |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Portfolio size | 20+ companies | 10-15 companies (higher conviction) |
| Learning cheques | First 5-8 deals | First 3-5 deals |
| When to invest | At deal signing | *After* 3-6 months of working together |
| Due diligence | External research | Already done - I'm inside the company |
| Follow-on reserve | 20% | 30%+ (double down on winners I helped create) |

**Revised Portfolio Math:**
- 5 learning cheques @ $3,750 avg = $18.75K
- 8 standard cheques @ $10K = $80K
- Follow-on reserve: 30% (~$37.5K) for doubling down on winners
- **Total: ~13 cash investments + equity positions from advisory**

### Why Smaller Portfolio Is Acceptable

Traditional angel math requires 20+ companies because you're playing pure probability. My model is different:

1. **I'm not passive** - I actively improve outcomes through GTM work
2. **Information advantage** - I've seen them execute under pressure for months
3. **Higher selectivity** - Only invest after advisory proves mutual fit
4. **Time is the constraint** - I can only deeply support 10-15 companies anyway
5. **Equity-for-advisory diversifies** - My "portfolio" includes non-cash positions

### What I Know That Pure Angels Don't

By the time I decide to invest cash, I've observed:

- [ ] Whether the founder is coachable (do they implement feedback?)
- [ ] Whether they execute on commitments (do they hit deadlines?)
- [ ] Whether the product actually works (have I seen demos, customer calls?)
- [ ] Whether customers actually pay (have I seen the pipeline?)
- [ ] Whether my GTM playbook fits their market (have I tested it?)
- [ ] How they handle adversity (have I seen them stressed?)
- [ ] How they treat their team (have I been in their Slack?)

This is information advantage no pitch deck or reference call provides.

### Conflict of Interest Protocol

The dual relationship (advisor + investor) creates potential conflicts:

**Risk:** My advice could be biased toward making my investment look good rather than what's genuinely best for the founder.

**Mitigations:**

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Transparency** | Disclose investment interest before it influences advice |
| **Sequence** | Investment decisions come AFTER advisory proves value, not before |
| **Consistency check** | If I wouldn't advise it for a non-portfolio company, don't advise it here |
| **Separation** | Advisory fee and investment are independent decisions |
| **Documentation** | Record rationale for major strategic recommendations |

**Red flags to watch for in myself:**
- Am I recommending they raise when they don't need to (so I can invest)?
- Am I pushing them toward metrics that look good vs. metrics that matter?
- Am I staying engaged because of investment, not because I'm adding value?
- Am I giving them more time than paying clients because I have equity?

### The "Invest After Advisory" Rule

**Default policy:** No cash investment until I've worked with a founder for at least 3 months.

**Exceptions:**
- Founder I've known for years through other contexts
- Strong co-investor doing the diligence I trust
- Learning cheque specifically to learn something new

**Why this works:**
- Removes FOMO pressure at first meeting
- Creates natural evaluation period
- Aligns incentives (I help them succeed → they become investable)
- Reduces awkwardness if I decide not to invest

## Appendix: Key Lessons from Cheryl Mack

1. **Have a strategy** - not "I like the guy"
2. **Small first cheques** - learning cheques exist for a reason
3. **Play the probability game** - 20+ companies minimum
4. **Don't pick winners** - make good bets
5. **Read the docs** - understand what you're signing
6. **Don't over-diligence** - respect founder time
7. **Founder quality > idea** - team is the constant
8. **Pace yourself** - dollar cost average over years
9. **Stay engaged** - read updates, offer help
10. **Keep a decision diary** - only way to learn

*"Angel investing is a long-term game of probabilities. Success comes from having a strategy, being consistent, managing your capital pace, and focusing on the quality of founders rather than trying to predict the future."* — Cheryl Mack
