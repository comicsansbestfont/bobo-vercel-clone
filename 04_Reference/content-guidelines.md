For: Sachee’s content strategy and copywriting team

Applies to: LinkedIn, podcast appearances, website copy, email, PDFs, decks, blog posts, social content

# **1. Big picture**

Our goals

- Build Sachee’s brand as a GTM advisor for B2B SaaS founders.
- Use past mining and drilling experience as credibility and story fuel.
- Avoid breaching any restraints from previous employment and share sale.

What we must avoid

- Looking like we are competing with CorePlan or any similar mining tech platform.
- Sharing confidential information about CorePlan, its customers, its tech or its internal workings.
- Targeting CorePlan customers.
- Disparaging CorePlan or its people.
- Talking about the settlement, deeds or share sale in public.

When in doubt

- Default to anonymised lessons, patterns and principles.
- If something feels spicy or too specific, flag it for review by Sachee, and potentially a lawyer.

# **2. Positioning anchor for all content**

Every piece of content must reinforce:

- Sachee is a GTM and founder led sales advisor.
- Primary audience is early stage B2B SaaS founders, especially vertical or heavy industry SaaS.
- Mining and drilling are case studies and background, not our current product focus.

In practical terms

- Strong: “What selling mining tech taught me about enterprise GTM.”
- Not allowed: “Here is how to implement operations software for your mine, with my help.”

# **3. Topics that are safe and encouraged**

You should actively lean into these themes.

**3.1 Lessons and patterns, not secrets**

Allowed

- Enterprise GTM lessons from conservative industries.
- How long sales cycles work in mining or drilling.
- How buying committees behave in complex environments.
- How to manage champions, blockers and politics in large organisations.
- Mistakes founders make when selling complex SaaS for the first time.

Example angles

- “Five brutal truths I learned selling software into conservative industries.”
- “What mining taught me about keeping enterprise deals alive for 12 months.”
- “The difference between ‘we are interested’ and ‘we are buying’ in enterprise deals.”

**3.2 Personal story and background**

Allowed

- High level career story.
- “I spent X years selling and scaling a mining tech SaaS company.”
- “We went from early pilots to multi site deployments across the mining value chain.”

No numbers or sensitive detail unless those facts are already clearly public.

**3.3 Anonymised client stories**

Allowed

- Stories about “a tier one miner” or “a mid size drilling contractor” with identifying details removed.
- Patterns like “a project almost died because the rollout had no owner.”

Checklist for anonymised stories

- No company names.
- No site names that can be easily traced.
- No internal budget or contract numbers.
- No specific product screenshots or internal documents.

**3.4 SaaS GTM playbooks**

Allowed

- Content about ICP, messaging, discovery, pricing, founder led sales, experiments, etc.
- Comparisons between selling into mining and selling into other verticals, at a high level.

# **4. Topics that are not allowed**

These are hard stops. Do not publish or even draft content that includes any of these without explicit legal sign off.

**4.1 Direct competition with CorePlan**

Not allowed

- Presenting or describing Sachee as building, running or advising a mining operations or drilling management platform that could be seen as a close substitute for CorePlan.
- Offering services that clearly help a mine “replace their current mining operations software vendor” where that vendor is likely CorePlan.
- Step by step playbooks that look like “how to beat CorePlan inside a mining account.”

How to test

- If a reasonable outsider would say “this sounds like a competitor to CorePlan”, do not publish.

**4.2 Confidential information about CorePlan or its customers**

Not allowed

- Internal financials, detailed metrics, margins, burn, internal board slide numbers.
- Internal product roadmap details that are not public.
- Non public architecture, algorithms or implementation detail.
- Exact customer lists, deal values, discount structures, payment terms, implementation plans.
- Screenshots or excerpts from internal decks, Notion, Slack, CRMs, proposals, or legal documents.

Safe rule for the team

- If the information lives in a private internal tool or document, treat it as confidential and do not publish.

**4.3 Naming and shaming**

Not allowed

- Naming CorePlan and criticising its product, people or strategy.
- Naming specific customers in a negative way, even if anonymised on the surface.
- Sharing grievances about the exit, founders, investors, board, or internal politics.

Examples to avoid

- “Vendors like [Company] are the reason mining tech fails.”
- “This customer was a nightmare and almost killed our company.”

We can talk about problems in the ecosystem, but never frame it as “this specific company is bad.”

**4.4 Targeting CorePlan customers**

Not allowed in content

- Direct or indirect calls to action aimed at named mining or drilling companies that you know are CorePlan customers.
- “If you are [Mine Name] or [Drilling Company Name], message me, I know how your current software vendor works.”

General categories like “if you are a VP ops in a conservative industry” are fine.

Avoid anything that looks like using insider knowledge of CorePlan’s customer base to solicit them.

**4.5 Talking about the settlement and share sale**

Not allowed

- Detailed discussion of the deed of separation, deed of settlement, share sale agreement, or their terms.
- Discussion of payouts, share prices, option treatment or legal disputes around the exit.
- “Behind the scenes” breakdowns of the legal or financial structure of the deal.

At most, keep it high level:

- “I exited my previous company and took some time off before starting my advisory.”

No blog posts or podcasts about “how my exit went down” without formal legal clearance.

# **5. Grey areas that require approval**

If a piece of content touches any of these, you must get sign off from Sachee before drafting fully, and he may send it to a lawyer.

1. Comparing CorePlan with other vendors, even if names are blurred.
2. Teaching mining companies how to select or switch mining operations software.
3. Deep tactical content that explains the exact sales strategies used to land or expand specific accounts.
4. Any mention of timeframes, money, or shareholder returns from the exit.
5. Naming any previous customers at all, even in a positive case study.

# **6. LinkedIn content rules**

**6.1 Hooks and angles that are encouraged**

- “What conservative industries like mining can teach SaaS founders about GTM.”
- “Three mistakes we kept seeing in enterprise buyers, and how founders can prevent them.”
- “How to keep a 12 month enterprise deal alive when everything goes quiet.”

Always frame mining as:

- A source of scar tissue and lessons, not territory we are trying to sell into right now.

**6.2 Things to avoid in LinkedIn posts**

- Naming CorePlan or individual CorePlan people.
- “Spilling tea” on your exit story.
- Posting contract values or internal metrics from deals.
- Promoting services that could be read as “I will help mines replace CorePlan.”

**6.3 Comments**

In comments on other people’s posts:

- Stay general.
- Do not confirm or deny whether a specific mine is or was a customer.
- Do not share internal anecdotes that could identify companies or individuals.

# **7. Podcasts, panels and live interviews**

Treat these like long form posts that you cannot edit.

Allowed

- Tell your career story in broad strokes.
- Share anonymised stories and lessons.
- Talk about patterns in enterprise GTM, and what founders can learn.

Not allowed

- Detailed “war stories” with identifiable companies, contracts or people.
- Negative commentary about CorePlan or your exit.
- Specific deal numbers or legal settlement detail.

If a host asks directly

- “Can you talk about your exit” or “what really happened with CorePlan”
    - Answer briefly and generically.
    - Example: “We had an exit, I took some time to decompress, and now I work with B2B SaaS founders on GTM. There are some legal limits on how much detail I can go into, but the key lesson for me was X.”
- 

# **8. Review process for the content team**

To keep this simple, use this checklist before publishing.

For every piece of content, ask:

1. Does this piece clearly position Sachee as a GTM advisor, not a mining software vendor?
2. Does it avoid naming CorePlan or specific mining customers?
3. Does it avoid any internal or non public information about past deals, roadmap, or finances?
4. Is the tone about lessons and systems, not blame or venting?
5. Could this reasonably be seen as trying to solicit known CorePlan customers or staff?

If any answer is a problem

- Stop and send the draft to Sachee with a note:
    - “Possible confidentiality issue here”
    - “Possible non compete issue here”
    - “Possible non disparagement issue here”
- 

# **9. What the team should do if they are unsure**

- Flag the specific sentence or paragraph that feels risky.
- Explain in one line why it might be a problem.
- Suggest a softer or more general alternative if possible.

Example

- Risky: “With one major miner we closed a mid six figure annual deal and cut their drilling reporting time by 60 percent.”
- Safer: “In one large enterprise deployment we cut reporting time by more than half.”

If you want, next step I can:

- Turn this into a shorter “one page checklist” version for freelancers.
- Or help you draft a short internal policy header that says “these guidelines are based on legal agreements and must be followed by anyone creating content for Sachee’s brand.”
