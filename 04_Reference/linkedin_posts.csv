"No, 135 clients at the agency," he corrects me. "We shut it all down to focus on Talvin AI. We have 3 SaaS customers."

Most people would call that failure. I call it balls.

I got off the call thinking: this is exactly the kind of founder I want to back.

Last week I caught up with Newan, founder of Talvin AI - a Sri Lankan AI startup.

——
Story⬇︎

19 years old when he started.  Finished his A-Levels exam on a Wednesday. Started his first company on Thursday.

I'm thinking "ok, another kid with big dreams." Then he told me how he got to that 135-client number.

Covid hits. Everything goes digital overnight. He and a few mates start building whatever people will pay for.

Over a few years that turns into a50 person team with clients 13-14 countries and projects with startups, enterprises, even government

Impressive. Till they hit a very boring, very painful wall.

They can't hire engineers fast enough. Recruitment becomes the bottleneck. They start losing big projects because they can't staff them.

So they do something most "AI startups" pretend they did.

They build a tool for themselves first.

A voice AI recruiter that: 
👌 Talks to candidates 24/7 
👌 Runs proper screening conversations 
👌 Spits out a shortlist so humans only talk to the best fits

They used Talvin to hire every single engineer for over a year — before they even had a landing page.

Only after that do they ask: "Ok, if this fixed our problem, who else looks like us?"

So where are they now?

The numbers are small, but the signal is deafening:
• Solid initial ARR from Enterprise Customers including Anytime Fitness, Mindvalley and Sampath Bank.
• Ranking # 1 for ai recruitment searches on google and chatgpt
• Customer driven roadmap with comprehensive integrations

Here are 3 "Green Flags" that got me fired up:

1️⃣ Derisked problem-solution fit. Most founders build a product based on a guess. Newan built this because his own hair was on fire.

2️⃣ No ghosts; ie flashy logos that are just pilots or trials.. Talvin has signed, rolled-out contracts with massive enterprises.

3️⃣ Newan is running a relentless, founder-led motion. He's not chasing vanity metrics or burning cash on ads.

Why share this?

Two reasons.

First, I want to start making these conversations public. There are founders out there doing thoughtful work that never hits your timeline.

Second, Talvin looks like the kind of company I wish more investors saw early. They capital efficient, and validated by real enterprise. 💪

And if you want more of these notes when I meet with founders, like this post and I'll keep sharing them.,21,6,"4,479 impressions",https://www.linkedin.com/analytics/post-summary/urn:li:activity:7396351440824270850/,

Or worse, no GTM at all. Just copying what big players do and forgetting those companies are playing a very different game. So the "GTM plan" ends up looking like this: → Hire a salesperson (with no real sales process and no clear ICP) → Post on LinkedIn (with no positioning that sets you apart from the other 47 startups in your space)  → Run Google Ads (to a website that lists features, not outcomes)  → Go to conferences (collect 50 business cards, follow up on 3)  → "Do more SEO" (whatever that means)  → Enter awards (aim for the "innovation" category) Nice. What you've built isn't a GTM strategy. It's a task list. And worse, one designed for companies with $5M in funding selling to a market of 50,000. After 18 years working on B2B deals in mining and hospitality, here is what actually counts towards gettting traction if you are pre revenue to 200k ARR: 1️⃣ ICP: The first 10 to 20 logos you would bet your runway on. Which role at which type of company is most likely to say yes in the next 90 days? 2️⃣ Problem story: A few clear use cases that describe the pain, what changes and what life looks like after your product. 3️⃣ Simple offer: One clear entry offer and price. No giant menu. Always solve for the customer. 4️⃣ Founder led path: A simple, repeatable path from contact to close (for example: 100 targets → 20 replies → 10 calls → 3 demos → 1 or 2 closes). 5️⃣ Early proof: Real usage and value. A few paying customers, before and after stories, a simple ROI example. 6️⃣ Channels: Based on where your buyer actually is. Not ""be everywhere."" Ignore these, and you'll burn months of precious runway wondering why your ""growth strategy"" generated 47 LinkedIn comments and 2 demos. But what I see instead: the founder hides in product. Stays in "we're still building" mode. Because shipping features feels like progress and sales feels uncomfortable. So talking to customer gets delayed. A junior BDR is hired before the founder has closed 10 customers. "Product market fit" is something they hope to find from behind a laptop. The thing is, you don't need a salesperson. You need to BE the salesperson. You don't need Google Ads. You need 100 targeted conversations. You don't need awards. You need referenceable customers. At early stage, your only unfair advantage is you. Your job is to talk to customers, do outreach and get rejected. Sitting in your spare bedroom doing cold outreach will move the needle more than tweaking your pitch deck hoping VC funding will create headlines and solve GTM for you. You know what will actually creates headlines? Running out of cash because you tried to scale a disjointed task list.

Many of you shared your own stories, and I deeply appreciate your trust. I’m glad I could help simply by listening As it turns out, the line about choosing between work-life balance and building something breakthrough landed in very different ways. I get it. Over the last few months, I’ve been sitting with wonderful founders and investors across Sri Lanka and Australia. It confirms a pattern I’ve been seeing for a long time, talking to early-stage startups to scale-ups. And the pattern is the same every time: 1️⃣ Early-stage founders are polishing the product, tweaking their website, and planning hires... all without earning the right to scale. (Some don't even have their first 10 customers). 2️⃣ Later-stage founders are struggling to go past their initial success and build a real, scalable engine. So for me, thinking about what I'm to do next... Honestly, I'm at a stage where I’ve been the first boots on ground multiple times at tech startups and corporate where ive built sales and customer teams from the ground up. Now, I want to share those learnings to help move the industry forward. That’s why I’m focusing exclusively on helping B2B SaaS founders solve those two exact problems. So, I’m humbly opening up a GTM advisory. My focus is simple: 🔵 Helping pre-revenue founders validate their market and win their first 10-50 customers. 🔵 Helping scaling founders build the revenue engine to get to $1M+ and beyond. ...all at - ahem- warp speed 😎🚀 I’ve whipped up a website with more details: www.sachee.com.au If you are building in vertical or heavy-industry SaaS and want help landing your first 10 to 30 customers + putting simple, sane go-to-market systems in place, I would love to talk. 📲 And to my mining network: thank you for all your support over the last few years.

I’ve been trying to figure out how to talk about this, and whichever way I write it, it feels cringe. Talking about the cost of building shouldn't feel cringe, right? The other day, I said I shed 99% of my belongings when I left Perth. Well some of those belongings were actually lot of tears. At the time, I had no idea what was happening. And let me tell you, once the tears started, they didn't stop for weeks. It got worse before it got better. Looking back, it's no surprise. I was working 70-80 plus hour weeks for years. It was the cost of building. It impacted my health, my relationships, and my mental state. Going around talking to friends, family, and founders, it turns out I'm not alone - a lot of people in high impact roles are going through burnout in one way shape or form. For people that are not in these situations talk about ""work-life balance"" or say ""you just need a regular holiday."" I sincerely don’t think a 2-week trip to Bali (as nice as it is) is a fix. It's a band-aid. I sincerely believe that any competitive human endeavor requires sacrifice. Whether it's athletics, arts, or entrepreneurship. Raw talent is not enough. You have to hustle.

Technically all true. 😅 I've been getting a ton of messages asking where I am and what I'm doing after my last post. So here's a life update. (I'm alive - I just dropped off the face of the earth for a bit.) In June, I shed about 99% of my belongings (including my cocktail shakers and an extremely large disco ball), stored my guitar and books at a mate's place in Perth, and just... left. One suitcase, one laptop, no fixed address. Sydney → Bali → Perth → Colombo. (I'm now back in Sydney.. for a wee bit) 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗻? Decompress. Relax. 𝘋𝘰 𝘯𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨. That lasted about 72 hours.

Same clunky systems as 2000. Geos drowning in spreadsheets instead of doing geology. Drilling contractors completely ignored. Customer experience was... well, let's just say there was room for improvement. Alex Goulios had built Springtech to solve these problem with a vision to digitise the industry, tackling challenges in mining and exploration. When I joined I talked to anyone and everyone in hashtag # miningandmetals to understand what was really going on. And then it hit me. We HAD to reposition and rebrand the company to CorePlan with a focus on solving for the root cause; the drilling contractors; and thereby saving the geos from excel (bit like 'save the cheerleader, save the world' from the show, Heroes) The product needed to become the heart of what we were building. But honestly, the real challenge wasn't technical. It was cultural. How do you create modern experiences in an industry that's been burned by software for decades? This meant rethinking everything (I got a bit obsessed with the details): from how we talk to customers to how we onboard them, from our brand (👋 Emmanuel!) to the type of people we bring into our company. Making presentations that broke industry convention - memes on presos and investor decks lol - to company parties that became absolute legendary, rave caves and all!. (This proved that serious business impact and genuine fun aren't mutually exclusive). The early days were a blur. figuring out GTM across Contractors vs Geos; mid market vs enterprise. Most days felt like controlled chaos, but the good kind. And this a silly line I wrote at the time is now the mission statement “help people in mining, work better together in the modern age”. But the real story of CorePlan is about the incredible community that embraced the movement; the people. I’m extremely proud of the teams we assembled; a crew of eager, smart, and quirky individuals who unusually passionate about the business and the industry and said, let's f'in go! Together, we built a global business and a movement from teeny tiny Perth thats now used by Tier 1 Mining and Drilling contractors and counteless SMBs, globally. Right now where ever there’s drilling in Australia there’s most likely CorePlan . But this chapter has an ending. After this incredible journey, I've left the business and no longer COO. It's bittersweet, but I'm excited about what comes next. For now, I'm taking some time to catch up with family and friends, get on the chooks, and figure out what mountain to climb next. Thank you to Alex for the journey, to our amazing team for your dedication, and to every customer, friend, and supporter who championed this mission.

No worries. They can use our free Contractor Portal to submit drilling data through the mobile or web app, or importing CSVs. ✅ API Integrations: CorePlan’s easy API integrations connect seamlessly with larger contractors who have established digital setups. ✅ Manual Entry and File Upload Options via Web Portal: If full integration or the contractor portal isn’t an option, you can capture plods by uploading CSV or XLS files, or by entering them directly through the Web Portal. We can even help automate this process with daily CSV emails that push directly into CorePlan. Give CorePlan a try and see why mining professionals are lovin’ it: https://lnkd.in/gmpCS6rb",15,,,,

Why on earth should be have another expense in a tool?"" 😳 Or ""What? 🧐 What's wrong with our current drilling data processes? Bob has built a robust system with Excel and SharePoint and it costs us nothing!"" It seems like everyone in mining is talking about data these days. But when it comes to drilling data, the conversation quickly shifts from excitement to frustration. These are some things that people that are actually entrenched in drilling operations hear from execs and senior management - when trying to get new initiatives past executives and management. It's no surprise really, given how few real Mining SaaS options are out there. (Most software in our industry is either legacy stuff, custom builds, or SaaS in disguise. 🥸) Most times, it means creating a whole new budget line item or asking to cut losses with existing investments - so you need to have (ahem) a rock-solid argument to present to your execs. i.e driving a compelling reason for the need to change. So to get help get this message across I’ve put together a comprehensive drilling software buying guide [which you could also apply for other saas in mining] which covers: • Assessing your current drilling data challenges • Evaluating Vendors • Navigating internal processes • Building a bulletproof business case Here’s a memo for a business case developed by Arya Stark from Stark Mining who used the guide to win CorePlan into the org away from a custom legacy system. ⚔️ 🐉 Full guide here -> https://lnkd.in/ePJF8pdE hashtag # MiningTech hashtag # miningandmetals hashtag # coreplan hashtag # drillingdatamanagement {{linkedin_mention(urn:li:organization:7787680|CorePlan)}}",208,5,"102,170 impressions",https://www.linkedin.com/analytics/post-summary/urn:li:activity:7226011088960573440/,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E10AQHMS2iiWBPz7A/image-shrink_800/image-shrink_800/0/1722815290522?e=1763949600&v=beta&t=mmOwYV6txCmN1_HPGww2A563SVPGRUfK5aELB_zcVu0

And not your first thought to see on a professional product presentation on drilling software. Let alone on a company’s brand. So why? ""Sachee, why are you so obsessed with emus?"" one of my friends asked recently. Well, let's rewind a bit. ⏰ Back in 2020 we were setting up our live chat for customer support, Alex suggested we should totally have a mascot for auto-replies after hours. Genius! And, Simple enough - - but have you ever tried to pick a mascot that is both unique and means something? For months I tried the usual suspects. Dogs? Too common. Cats? I’m allergic. Iguanas? Ew too scaly. What about a Kangaroo? Mate, we're Australian, not a tourist trap. 🦘🐨🇦🇺 Then, in a moment of pure Aussie inspiration (read: I was enjoying a cold one with the boys), it hit me. The answer was staring right at me from the can of my favourite beer, Emu Export. The emu on that tin, staring at me with those beady eyes, was the answer we'd been looking for. Now, this isn't just any beer. The ""bush chook"" as we call it, is a piece of hashtag # WesternAustralia in a can. 🍺 It reminds me of warm summer days and this one road trip through Karijini where I had nothing but lukewarm beer to keep me hydrated. And when I introduced Alex to the good stuff - He starts telling me how it reminds him of his old man, who always with a carton at home. Is this stuff is woven into the fabric of our lives, you know? But here's the thing – our driller buddies love it too! It's like we're all part of this secret bush chook club haha. 😅✨ Now, I know what you're thinking. ""Sachee, have you lost the plot? An emu? Based on beer? What about the optics?!"" And you're right to question it. Emus are weird. They're gangly, they can't fly, and they look like they were put together by a committee. But that's what makes them special. Emus are survivors. They're resilient, adaptable, and distinctive - not to mention fast and agile. In an industry that's been slow to produce change, that's exactly the spirit we need. We as a company need to be the emu. 🏃‍♂️💨 We might look a bit odd at first glance, but we're resilient, we're fast on our feet, and we're not afraid to tackle problems head-on. (Fun fact: Emus can run at up to 50 km/h) So yes, we put an emu on our brand. 👉 Have you seen the emu? Comment “ive seen the emu” for the giggles. 👉 Want to see the emu?

Many companies are discovering this critical weakness and the house of cards that is their drilling software - whether done via an off the shelf solution or custom built. The number of calls I personally take with execs, data systems leaders and geology superintendents where comments get thrown around like: 🗣️ “we wanted to do this for months but we still can’t get the correct reporting” or 🗣️ “everytime something changes we have to go back to the vendor and wait months” Or worse yet: 🗣️ “they promised they can do it all, and we trusted the brand and we took their word for it without doing our due diligence” 🧐 So what’s happening here? 🧐 1️⃣ Rigid Data Structures Problem: These systems feature inflexible data models that resist modification or expansion, creating challenges for adapting to operational needs. Why? • Legacy design = hard to modify • Short-term focus ignores future needs 2️⃣ Limited Customisation Capabilities Issue: User-friendly customisation - Not in these systems. Mining companies struggle to tailor software to their unique operations. Why? • Closed architecture restricts user-level customisation, requiring vendor involvement. • Vendor dependence = costly delays for every tweak 3️⃣ Poor Integration Support Challenge: These systems create data silos, blocking smooth information flow across departments.Why? • Non-standard formats and proprietary structures complicate data exchange = Integration nigtmares • Weak APIs limit automation and cross-system functionality 4️⃣ Inability to Handle Complex Relationships Headache: Many systems fumble with the intricate, multi-dimensional relationships in mining data. Why? • Lack of relational design = inefficient data management • Short-term solutions mindsets with Features and tables added without long-term vision = a convoluted “Frankenstein” product and model 🧟‍♂️ 5️⃣ Lack of Scalability Most software cant handle exponential data growth and struggle to scale. Why? • Fixed constraints with hard limits on fields, records, or relationships restrict growth. • Performance issues where data models not optimised for large volumes slow down as data increases. 🤔 So what can digital transformation leads, geos and data professionals do about it? 🤩 Implement a drilling software package ofcourse - tools that are specifically designed for the operations of drilling programs. ➡️ Based on industry feedback ive put a list of the most popular drilling software for mining and metals here: https://hubs.ly/Q02HmPsM0 hashtag # miningandmetals hashtag # drillingdatamanagment hashtag # diamonddrilling hashtag # mineralexploration CorePlan",21,,"2,040 impressions",https://www.linkedin.com/analytics/post-summary/urn:li:activity:7220918147086696448/,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E10AQGNZs_AmXSfZw/image-shrink_480/image-shrink_480/0/1721601044174?e=1763949600&v=beta&t=9h0ppZyKDpoHhrFB5GB-THuSsTid6fJvt1Kms1exCE0

What I’m constantly hearing is this: 👉 Even with automated imports, data is often days (sometimes weeks) old by the time it reaches the database. Forget about real-time insights when it takes that long to process a spreadsheet. 👉 Operational teams have their spreadsheets, geologists have their databases... and no one has the complete picture. This lack of visibility makes it nearly impossible to collaborate effectively or track costs proactively. 👉 hashtag # Drillingdata arrives in a chaotic mix of formats, from spreadsheets and PDFs to even handwritten logs. Even when data is digital, discrepancies in units and inconsistent activity definitions create a minefield of hidden errors. ""𝙸𝚜 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚜𝚞𝚛𝚟𝚎𝚢 𝚍𝚊𝚝𝚊 𝚎𝚟𝚎𝚗 𝚏𝚘𝚛 𝚃𝙷𝙰𝚃 𝚑𝚘𝚕𝚎?"" 👉 Due to no data governance - data validation is often non-existent. Without standardised activity lists and automated checks, errors slip through, corrupting databases. Fixing those errors or repairing the scripts is just a given on a regular basis. These headaches aren't just stopping data teams from reaching their full potential; they're slowing down projects, blowing out costs and introducing risk to resource estimate. Instead of being strategic advisors, and uncovering valuable insights... they're stuck in a reactive cycle of data entry, cleanup, script repairs, and fixing custom reports for the drilling operations teams.

Like, why is that hole so expensive? or are night shifts really worth it? Turns out, a lot of those questions come down to understanding how your rigs are *actually* spending their time. 🤔 To answer these questions easily, you gotta get your activities categorised to figure out their time. or; set up your time usage models. You need to understand the full picture. And, no - I'm not talking about just tracking ""drilling time"". You will want to see: 🟦 Active (Productive) Time: Reaming, casing, tripping - it's all essential, but is it efficient? 🟧 Standby (Operational vs. External): Is the rig waiting on your crew, or are external factors (like weather) to blame? Big difference for cost control. 🟨 Maintenance (Planned vs. Unplanned): A well-maintained rig drills more. Tracking this helps you spot potential problems before they cause costly downtime. But the thing is, not a lot of teams are using them (or if they are it's done so after so much manual handling you've gotta wonder how accurate they are) So, I've put together an explainer that walks you through Time Usage Models, step-by-step.

We've seen this rodeo enough times to fill a Netflix special. Custom software proposals can paint a picture of doing everything a fully built Enterprise SaaS (like CorePlan for drilling operations) do, but for a fraction of the cost. Bargain alert, right? Wrong. 🙈 It is exciting to think of getting a custom-made solution, specifically for you where you can dictate what it looks like - but the reality is that they more often than not often morph into clunky, slow, and expensive technological Frankensteins. 🧟‍♂️ If you put your commercial hat on taking into consideration the opportunity costs, lost time and longevity of custom development is going to make or break the future of your company's digital infrastructure. And the realities of custom development are: - False Promise of Perfection: The vendor gets swept away by endless tweaks, bogging down your system. - Opaque Pricing: Super low costs raise red flags. Are hidden fees lurking, or is their data the real prize? - Tech Debt: These solutions, often built on outdated technology, accumulate bugs and glitches, becoming a patchwork of fixes. Integration Hell: Connecting to existing systems becomes a nightmare, hindering progress. - Customer Support: Typically custom software vendors bless their non-saas cotton socks aren’t setup for effective end user support or scale. - Team Experience: UX/UI is typically an afterthought and your team, whether geologists or drillers all suffer. Drilling Operations in Mining is complex and getting your techstack is always going to be challenging. Not all software can do everything for everyone and generally software specialises in their key focus areas after years or research and development, and testing! Initially cheap, custom development can turn into an endless cycle of fixes and updates that all contribute to your total cost of ownership. By the time it's ready, your needs might have morphed into something that Franken-tech-software just can't handle. So what is ✨ Mining SaaS ✨ - link to a write up in the comments below.

A bit later on I purchased my first gold coins which just happened to be the Australian Kangaroo sold by the Gold Corporation - The Perth Mint (Which is where I'm located now!) 🥇🪙 Being brought up in Dublin, Ireland we weren't exposed to these topics and we certainly weren't exposed to the mining industry as a possible career path in general. I got my business degree and then decided to pursue a career in sales which is where my skillsets naturally took me. Fast forward to now, and I have magically been able to tie my hobby and my career together by joining the CorePlan Team here in Perth, Australia. For those of you who don't know what we do, we're a SaaS company providing a web based platform to Drilling Contractors and Mining Companies to keep it brief. 💻 So last week when I got to go to Diggers & Dealers Mining Forum in Kalgoorlie and actually got to speak with some of the companies I have been following for years, it was a bit of a pinch me moment. It also felt quite surreal to be sitting in the lecture hall listening to many great MD's and Exploration Managers speaking about their past and upcoming projects. And apparently hashtag # lithium is going to the moon 📈🚀. The cherry on top was DDH1 Drilling inviting us to their drill rig. I got to see a Diamond Rig being operated first hand by some of their fantastic staff. This really made the whole experience feel very special. 👷🏻‍♂️ I couldn't be more excited to see where this journey takes me, it's been a pretty great experience so far. So thank you Sachee Perera and Alex Goulios for the opportunity! hashtag # Coreplan hashtag # DiggersAndDealers hashtag # FreeTheGeos hashtag # DrillEmFillEmBillEm hashtag # MiningIndustry hashtag # Gold hashtag # Silver hashtag # Lithium",108,19,,,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQFahTV-2MHoKA/feedshare-shrink_800/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1692158211817?e=1764806400&v=beta&t=Vv4TrmKju6dOyYQNdA0szpIkNg4OPRYIkXgMdlmmgXg

Well, let's just say it wasn't on some sun-soaked Mediterranean beach. Instead, I found myself in a realm far less glamorous: the mining industry (apologies, CorePlan , but it's the truth). But now, two years in, I’m well and truly loving it (even though the closest I’ve come to a Greece trip is my Greek boss Alex Goulios )! Guided by an incredible team, who've been seriously patient, I've been presented with countless opportunities to grow both personally and professionally. But two years later, it’s only NOW that I’m finally feeling confident amongst a room full of peers, prospects and competitors… Now, let's talk gender biases - stick with me here. Picture this: me, often brushed aside and overlooked in chats with guys who might as well be my Dad (shoutout Grant M. ). Were their assumptions about my youth and lack of knowledge mostly accurate? Regrettably, yes. Did it faze me? Not always… Sometimes, I preferred zoning out rather than grappling with convos in a language even the creators of the Oxford Dictionary would struggle to comprehend.🤕 Fast forward to this year, and I'm lucky enough to have scored a second invite to Diggers & Dealers Mining Forum . And you know what's refreshing? A diverse wave of young faces, representing their respective companies. So, to all those who are still struggling to find their feet, here are my nuggets of wisdom💡: 1. Make yourself heard in conversations where you can add value, and listen (ACTUALLY listen) patiently when you can’t. 🎙️ 2. Make an effort to remember people. It seems obvious, but mining is a tight-knit community and good connections are solid gold. 🤝 3. Hands-on life experience is the best way to learn quickly - shoutout to DDH1 Drilling for giving us the best VIP experience on one of their Diamond rigs last week. 💎 To sum it up, in the wise words of Napoleon Hill, “Patience, persistence, and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success"" (but pro tip: remember your deodorant because no one likes BO).

The Paper Plod, also know as the daily drill report, was the gospel and source of truth of what happened out in the field. And you know what, for the most part it seemed to work. Right? 🧐 Exploration managers and DBAs had to wrestle with paper plods, spreadsheets, complex macros and disjointed custom systems to push data into their database. If you’re reading this as an exploration manager or a DBA you probably know all about the frustrations of working with drill contractors with getting accurate drilling data and costing. But today more and more drill contractors are rapidly moving to digitise internal data capture. At CorePlan over the last two years we have onboarded 29 drill contractors in Australia. These range from boutique drill contractors and mid tiers such as Impact Drilling, Seismic and Terra Drilling that have migrated from that full manual pen & paper based workflow There has also been a shift from large drill contractors such as DDH1 and TopDrill that have dropped the use of multiple custom systems to focus on serving their clients (you) better. 👉 EXPLORATION MANAGERS AND DBAs: what does this mean for you when you think of working with modern drill contractors that have adopted a collaborative digital workflow? Would love to hear your take.
