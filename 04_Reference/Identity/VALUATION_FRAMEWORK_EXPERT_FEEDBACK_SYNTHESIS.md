# Valuation Framework Expert Feedback Synthesis

**Date:** December 2025
**Experts Consulted:** 4 (AU/NZ VC partners and angel investors)
**Framework Version Reviewed:** 2.1 (AU Market Calibrated + Reality Check)

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Verdict:** The framework is **80% correct** and represents "serious work" that is "directionally right" and "grounded in AU reality." All four experts validated the core architecture (fit-ladder, Berkus/Scorecard pairing, Reality Check).

**The Reality Check is unanimously praised** as the framework's most valuable contribution — it solves the systematic overvaluation problem with traditional methods.

**Key calibration issues identified:**
1. Idea-stage caps are too low (market prices at 2-3x current caps)
2. AI sector premium significantly underweighted (42% market premium vs. +$100K)
3. Double-counting risk in modifier system
4. Missing ownership/dilution sanity check
5. Market-fit penalty should vary by sales complexity

---

## Consensus: What All Experts Agree On

| Element | Consensus View |
|---------|----------------|
| **Phase Classification (Fit Ladder)** | Correct and useful |
| **Berkus $800K/element calibration** | Appropriate for AU 2025 |
| **Reality Check concept** | Essential — the key innovation |
| **Founder Engine Score** | Strong methodology |
| **Zero-traction discounts (-50% to -70%)** | Appropriate (some say slightly generous) |
| **Founder-market fit penalty concept** | Valid and important |
| **Framework usability** | Yes, with tiered simplification |

---

## Critical Finding #1: Idea-Stage Caps Are Too Low

**The Problem:** Current caps ($300K-$800K) are below actual AU market pricing.

| Stage | Current Framework | Expert 1 | Expert 3 | Expert 4 |
|-------|-------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Idea only (no product) | $300K-$500K | $800K-$1.2M | ~$500K (validated) | $300K-$500K (validated) |
| MVP, no users | $400K-$600K | $1.0M-$1.8M | | $400K-$600K (validated) |
| MVP with users, no revenue | $500K-$800K | $1.5M-$3.0M | | $500K-$800K (validated) |
| First paying customers | $800K-$1.5M | $2.5M-$4.5M | | $800K-$1.5M (validated) |

**Accelerator Benchmarks (for reference):**
- Startmate Spark: $1.0M cap
- Startmate Accelerator: $1.5M cap
- Antler Australia: $1.875M cap

**Resolution:** Expert 1 argues for significant increases; Experts 3 & 4 validate current caps. **Recommendation:** Keep caps conservative but add note that accelerator/repeat-founder deals may price 2-3x higher.

---

## Critical Finding #2: AI Premium Significantly Underweighted

**The Data (Expert 4):**
- AI companies: $17.9M median seed valuation
- Non-AI companies: $12.6M median seed valuation
- **Premium: 42%**

| Current | Recommended |
|---------|-------------|
| +$100K-$200K to Sound Idea | +$200K-$400K per element |

**Expert 1 Caveat:** Only award AI premium if there's:
- Privileged data
- Demonstrable model performance
- Workflow lock-in

Not every "AI-powered" product deserves the premium.

---

## Critical Finding #3: Double-Counting in Modifier System

**Expert 1 & 3 Flag:** The same weakness can be penalized 3+ times:

1. **Founder Engine Score** — Problem Clarity, Selling Capability
2. **Market/Cultural Fit Modifier (Section B)** — -7% to -17.5%
3. **Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty (Section E3)** — -10% to -20%
4. **GTM Readiness Score** — related factors

**Expert 3's Fix:** Merge into ONE simple three-tier system:

| Fit Level | Single Penalty |
|-----------|---------------|
| Strong fit (from country AND from industry) | 0% |
| Partial fit (one barrier) | -5% to -7% |
| Weak fit (double barrier) | -10% to -15% |

**Delete:** Separate Section B AND Section E3. Replace with single assessment.

---

## Critical Finding #4: Missing Ownership/Dilution Sanity Check

**Expert 1 & 3:** "The single biggest 'market reality' anchor missing."

**The Rule:**
```
Implied Pre = (Round Size / Target Dilution) - Round Size
```

**AU/NZ 2024-25 Ranges:**

| Round | Size Range | Dilution | Implied Pre Range |
|-------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| Pre-seed (angel-only) | $750K-$2.5M | 5%-12% | $5.5M-$18M |
| Pre-seed (with lead) | $750K-$2.5M | 10%-20% | $3.0M-$22M |
| Seed | $2M-$6M | 15%-25% | $6M-$34M |

**Use as bounding box:** If framework output doesn't align with what the round size implies, something is off.

---

## Critical Finding #5: Market-Fit Penalty Should Vary by Sales Complexity

**Expert 2's Insight:** "At Phase 1a, there is no PLG. The market-fit penalty isn't just about 'can you sell' — it's about 'do you understand the problem space.'"

**Recommended Variable Penalty:**

| Sale Type | Penalty | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| High-touch enterprise | -20% to -25% | Mining, construction, healthcare |
| SMB direct sales | -15% to -20% | Tradies, small hospitality |
| Horizontal SaaS to tech-native buyers | -10% to -15% | Dev tools, marketing tech |

**Expert 1's Reframe:** Change from "not from country" to "buyer access risk" — penalize the GTM reality, not nationality.

---

## Critical Finding #6: Need for Guardrails (Modifier Caps)

**Expert 3 Recommendation:**

| Guardrail | Cap |
|-----------|-----|
| **Global modifier cap** | ±40% across all non-Reality Check modifiers |
| **Founder-related modifier cap** | ±30% net effect |
| **Sector adjustments cap** | +$300K total |
| **Premature scaling penalty** | -40% (not -50%) |
| **Grit/tenacity premium** | +15-20% (not +25%) |

**Rationale:** Prevents extreme swings when multiple modifiers compound in the same direction.

---

## Critical Finding #7: Berkus Should Be Phase-Dependent

**Expert 3:**

| Phase | Berkus Max |
|-------|------------|
| Phase 1a | Cap at $3M (unless override) |
| Phase 1b+ | Allow full $4M |

**Rationale:** $4M is "slightly generous for true 1a teams with weak proof and first-time founders."

## Portfolio Re-Valuations: Expert Comparisons

| Company | Current v2.1 | Expert 1 | Expert 3 | Expert 4 | Recommended |
|---------|--------------|----------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **MyTab** | $2.0-3.0M | $2.3-3.4M | $2.0-2.5M center | $2.5-3.5M | **$2.0-3.0M** (validated) |
| **Talvin** | $1.5-2.5M | $1.8-3.0M | — | — | **$1.8-2.8M** |
| **SwiftCheckin** | $600K-1.0M | $1.0-1.8M | — | — | **$800K-1.2M** |
| **Tandm** | $575K-800K | $1.0-1.5M | — | — | **$800K-1.2M** |
| **ControlShiftAI** | $500-750K | $1.2-2.0M | Validated | — | **$750K-1.2M** |
| **ArcheloLab** | $300-500K | $800K-1.2M | Validated | — | **$500K-800K** |

**Pattern:** Expert 1 prices zero-traction deals 50-100% higher than current framework, aligning with SAFE cap market reality. Experts 3 & 4 validate current ranges as conservative but appropriate.

**Recommendation:** Current ranges are defensible. Add note that deals may clear 50-100% higher with strong signaling or milestone step-ups.

## Missing Elements Identified

| Missing Element | Cited By | Priority |
|-----------------|----------|----------|
| **Ownership/dilution sanity check** | Expert 1, 3 | HIGH |
| **Time-since-founding modifier** | Expert 2 | MEDIUM |
| **Team composition beyond founder** | Expert 2 | MEDIUM |
| **Runway/burn rate consideration** | Expert 2, 3 | MEDIUM |
| **Quality of existing investors** | Expert 2 | LOW |
| **Liquidation preference/structure** | Expert 2, 3 | LOW |
| **Revenue quality factors (NRR, GRR, burn multiple)** | Expert 1 | MEDIUM |
| **Path to US/larger market** | Expert 1 | LOW |

---

## Founder Engine Score: Refinements

**Expert 2 Concerns:**
1. Linear Berkus conversion may underweight exceptional founders
2. "Selling Capability" vs "Founder-Led Sales Execution" overlap

**Expert 1's Convex Kicker:**

| FE Score | Linear Value | Convex Kicker | Total |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| ≤4.3 | FE × $160K | — | Standard |
| 4.3-4.6 | $688K-$736K | +$50K-$100K | $738K-$836K |
| 4.6-5.0 | $736K-$800K | +$100K-$200K | $836K-$1M (cap at $900K) |

**Expert 3's Weight Adjustment:**
- Reduce Positioning Instinct: 12% → 8%
- Increase Problem Clarity or Learning Velocity with freed weight

## Conclusion

The framework is fundamentally sound and solves a real problem (systematic overvaluation of early-stage companies). Key improvements:

1. **Add the ownership/dilution sanity check** — critical for market reality
2. **Eliminate double-counting** — merge market-fit penalties into one system
3. **Add guardrails** — cap total modifier effects at ±40%
4. **Increase AI premium** — current calibration significantly underweights market reality
5. **Create tiered outputs** — one-page quick screen for practical use

The experts would use this framework with these calibrations applied.
