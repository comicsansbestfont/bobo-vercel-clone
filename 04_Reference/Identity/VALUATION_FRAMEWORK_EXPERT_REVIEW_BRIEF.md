# Valuation Framework Expert Review Brief

**Prepared by:** Sachee Perera
**Date:** December 2025
**Purpose:** Seeking expert review of early-stage B2B SaaS valuation framework
**Audience:** VC partners, angel investors, and valuation experts with AU/NZ market experience

---

## 1. Executive Summary

I've developed an internal valuation framework for evaluating early-stage B2B SaaS companies in Australia/New Zealand. The framework is used for:

1. **Client advisory** - Helping founders understand their position and investor-readiness
2. **Personal investment decisions** - Angel investments in the $10K-$50K range
3. **VC introductions** - Packaging deals with methodology and credibility

I'm seeking expert feedback on the framework's logic, calibration, and real-world applicability before using it more broadly.

**The core question:** Is this framework producing realistic valuations that align with actual AU market deal terms?

---

## 2. Australian B2B SaaS Market Context

### 2.1 Market Benchmarks (2024-2025)

The framework is calibrated against these AU market data points:

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Pre-seed median deal size | $1.0M | 2024 record high |
| Seed median deal size | $3.0M | 2024 record high |
| YoY valuation increase | +11-12% | 2023→2024 |
| Capital efficiency vs UK peers | 2x more efficient | Airtree research |
| Female-led funding share | Growing, explicit preference | Multiple AU VC statements |

### 2.2 AU Pre-Seed/Seed Characteristics

The AU market has distinct characteristics compared to US:

- **Smaller market** - TAM limitations for AU-only plays
- **Higher capital efficiency** - Founders stretch dollars further
- **Relationship-driven** - Small investor community, reputation matters
- **Vertical strength** - Mining, agriculture, construction SaaS punches above weight
- **Founder quality bar** - VCs report founder/team as #1 selection criterion

### 2.3 Current Investment Climate

- Record deal sizes but selective deployment
- Flight to quality over volume
- Unit economics scrutiny increased post-2022 correction
- AI premium in current market
- Industrial/vertical B2B gaining favor over horizontal plays

---

## 3. Framework Architecture

### 3.1 Phase Classification

The framework uses a fit-ladder model where companies progress through phases:

| Phase | ARR Range | Customer Count | Core Question | Primary "Fit" |
|-------|-----------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **1a** | $0-50K | 0-10 | Will anyone pay? | Problem-Solution Fit |
| **1b** | $50-200K | 10-30 | Can we repeat this? | Early Product-Market Fit |
| **2** | $200K-1M | 30-100 | Can others sell it? | Go-to-Market Fit |
| **3** | $1M-10M | 100+ | Can we scale without breaking? | Operational Fit |

**Rationale:** Phase determines which valuation method is primary. Revenue multiples are meaningless at Phase 1a; they become primary at Phase 2+.

### 3.2 Valuation Methods by Phase

| Phase | Primary Method | Secondary Method | Revenue Multiple Relevance |
|-------|----------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **1a** | Berkus + Founder Assessment | Scorecard | Irrelevant |
| **1b** | Scorecard + GTM Readiness | Berkus | Directional only |
| **2** | VC Method + Unit Economics | Scorecard | Meaningful (8-15x) |
| **3** | Revenue Multiple + Comparables | VC Method | Primary (5-12x) |

---

## 4. Berkus Method (AU 2025 Calibrated)

### 4.1 Base Values

| Element | Max Value (AUD) | Assessment Criteria |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Sound Idea** | $800K | Real problem? Evidence of pain? Market timing? |
| **Working Product** | $800K | Does it work? Tech risk reduced? Users? |
| **Quality Founder** | $800K | Founder Engine Score × $160K |
| **Strategic Relationships** | $800K | Customers, advisors, partnerships that de-risk |
| **Early Revenue** | $800K | Paying customers? Revenue quality? Retention? |
| **TOTAL** | **$4M** | |

**Calibration rationale:**
- Original Berkus (US) used $500K/element, $2.5M max
- AU pre-seed median is $3M (record), so $4M max allows range around median
- $800K/element × 5 = $4M theoretical max, but typical deals land $1.5-3M

### 4.2 Sector Adjustments

| Sector | Adjustment | Rationale |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| AI-first products | +$100K to Sound Idea | Current market premium |
| Industrial B2B (mining, construction) | +$200K to Strategic Relationships | Enterprise relationships harder to build |
| Female-led teams | +$100K to Quality Founder | Explicit AU investor preference |
| Hardware/robotics/IoT | +$100K to Working Product | Non-software led 2024 funding |
| Climate tech | +$50K to Sound Idea | Resilient sector |

**Question for reviewers:** Are these sector adjustments appropriate? Too generous? Missing sectors?

---

## 5. Founder Engine Score

### 5.1 The Scoring Model

The framework includes a weighted founder assessment. At Phase 1a, the founder IS the sales motion, so execution matters as much as capability.

| Dimension | Description | Weight (Phase 1a) |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Selling Capability** | Can they sell when they engage? | 20% |
| **Founder-Led Sales Execution** | Are they actually doing the sales work? | 15% |
| **Learning Velocity** | How fast do they iterate? | 20% |
| **Problem Clarity** | Can they articulate customer pain? | 18% |
| **Coachability** | Do they take feedback and act? | 15% |
| **Positioning Instinct** | Contrarian differentiation? | 12% |

**Score interpretation:**
| Score | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| 4.0+ | Exceptional - strong invest signal |
| 3.5-4.0 | Solid - investable |
| 3.0-3.5 | Developing - advisory first |
| 2.5-3.0 | Significant gaps - pass or coach-only |
| <2.5 | Not ready - pass |

### 5.2 Founder Score → Berkus "Quality Founder"

**Formula:** Founder Engine Score × $160K = Quality Founder Element

| FE Score | Berkus Quality Founder |
|----------|------------------------|
| 5.0 | $800K (max) |
| 4.0 | $640K |
| 3.5 | $560K |
| 3.0 | $480K |
| 2.5 | $400K |

**Question for reviewers:** Is this linear relationship appropriate? Should exceptional founders (4.5+) get non-linear premium?

---

## 6. Scorecard Method (AU 2025 Calibrated)

### 6.1 Base and Factors

**Base:** $3.0M (AU pre-seed median 2025)

| Factor | Weight | Score Range | Max Adjustment |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Founder/Team | 30% | 0.5-1.5 | ±15% |
| Market Size & Timing | 20% | 0.5-1.5 | ±10% |
| Product/Tech | 15% | 0.5-1.5 | ±7.5% |
| Competition | 10% | 0.5-1.5 | ±5% |
| Sales/Channels | 10% | 0.5-1.5 | ±5% |
| Traction Quality | 10% | 0.5-1.5 | ±5% |
| Investor Signals | 5% | 0.5-1.5 | ±2.5% |

**Score guide:**
- 0.5 = Major weakness
- 0.75 = Below average
- 1.0 = Average
- 1.25 = Above average
- 1.5 = Exceptional strength

---

## 7. Phase 1a Modifiers

These adjust base valuations for Phase 1a-specific factors.

### 7.1 Founder-Led Execution Modifier

| Founder-Led Execution Score | Modifier |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| 5 (Obsessively doing sales) | +15% |
| 4 (Actively doing sales) | +10% |
| 3 (Doing some sales) | 0% |
| 2 (Delegating most sales) | -15% |
| 1 (Avoiding sales / hired prematurely) | -25% |

**Rationale:** At Phase 1a, founders who delegate sales prematurely haven't validated their own ability to close. This is a significant risk.

### 7.2 Market/Cultural Fit Modifier

| Condition | Modifier |
|-----------|----------|
| Founder NOT from country selling in | -7% |
| Founder has NO industry background | -7% |
| Evidence of trust barriers | -3.5% |
| **Maximum Cumulative** | **-17.5%** |

**Rationale:** B2B sales in Australia (especially to SMBs/tradies/industrial) heavily favors founders who "speak the language" and understand cultural context.

### 7.3 Premature Scaling Penalty

| Symptom | Penalty |
|---------|---------|
| Hired sales before founder closed 5+ deals | -20% |
| SDRs/BDRs before validated ICP | -15% |
| Significant paid ads before positioning clear | -10% |
| 5+ employees with <$50K ARR | -10% |
| **Maximum Cumulative** | **-50%** |

### 7.4 Grit/Tenacity Premium

| Behavior | Premium |
|----------|---------|
| Manual high-touch founder-led sales | +10% |
| Evidence of facing rejection and iterating | +5% |
| Extreme capital efficiency | +10% |
| Bootstrapped to $50K+ ARR | +10% |
| **Maximum Cumulative** | **+25%** |

## 8. Reality Check (v2.1) — THE CRITICAL ADDITION

### 8.1 The Problem

When I first applied this framework to my deal portfolio, I got valuations that seemed unrealistic:

- A company with **zero customers and zero revenue** was valuing at **$1.2-1.8M**
- Another company with **no product, no customers** was valuing at **$1.0-1.7M**

This didn't pass the smell test. The Berkus and Scorecard methods give credit for "potential" — but potential without proof is worth very little in the AU market.

### 8.2 Reality Check Components

#### E1. Zero-Traction Discount (MANDATORY if ARR=0 AND Customers=0)

| Condition | Discount |
|-----------|----------|
| ARR = $0 AND Paying Customers = 0 | **-50% to -60%** |
| ARR = $0 AND Paying Customers = 0 AND No product | **-60% to -70%** |
| Pilot/POC only (no paying customers) | **-30% to -40%** |

#### E2. Idea-Stage Valuation Cap

| Stage Evidence | Maximum Valuation |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Idea only (no product) | $300K - $500K |
| MVP but no users | $400K - $600K |
| MVP with users, no revenue | $500K - $800K |
| First paying customer(s) | $800K - $1.5M |

#### E3. Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty

| Condition | Penalty |
|-----------|---------|
| Founder NOT from country AND NOT from industry | **-20%** |
| Founder NOT from industry (selling B2B to that industry) | **-15%** |
| Founder from industry but NOT from country | **-10%** |

#### E4. Override Conditions

The Reality Check can be reduced (not eliminated) if:

| Override Condition | Adjustment |
|--------------------|------------|
| Serial entrepreneur with successful exit | Reduce discount by 20% |
| Deep domain expert (10+ years in industry) | Reduce discount by 15% |
| Proprietary technology with IP protection | Reduce discount by 10% |
| Strong existing investor commitments | Reduce discount by 10% |
| **Maximum override** | **50% of original discount** |

**Question for reviewers:** Are these discounts and caps in line with what you see in actual AU deal terms?

---

## 9. GTM Readiness Score

The framework includes a Go-To-Market readiness assessment that modifies valuation.

### 9.1 Components

| Component | Weight | Assessment |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| ICP Clarity | 15% | Can they describe ideal customer in detail? |
| Sales Process Documentation | 15% | Written playbook or in founder's head? |
| Pipeline Predictability | 15% | Do they know what's coming? |
| CAC Clarity | 10% | Do they know cost to acquire? |
| Conversion Rates | 10% | What % of demos convert? |
| Repeatable Channel | 15% | Is there ONE channel that works? |
| Win/Loss Analysis | 10% | Do they know why they win/lose? |
| Competitive Positioning | 10% | Clear wedge vs. incumbents? |

### 9.2 GTM Score → Valuation Modifier

| GTM Score | Stage | Modifier |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| 0-25 | Chaos | -20% |
| 25-50 | Emerging | 0% |
| 50-75 | Investable | +15% |
| 75-100 | Scale-ready | +30% |

---

## 10. Portfolio Valuation Examples

I've applied this framework to 6 early-stage B2B SaaS companies I'm evaluating for advisory and/or investment. Here are the results using framework v2.1 with Reality Check:

### 10.1 Summary Table

| Company | ARR | Customers | Product | Industry Fit | FE Score | GTM | Reality Check Applied | **Final Range** |
|---------|-----|-----------|---------|--------------|----------|-----|-----------------------|-----------------|
| **MyTab** | $24K | 16 venues | Yes | Yes (hospitality) | 4.08/5 | 35/100 | No discount (has traction) | **$2.0-3.0M** |
| **Talvin** | $12K | 3-4 enterprise | Yes | Partial (hiring pain from agency) | 4.0/5 | 45/100 | -10% market fit | **$1.5-2.5M** |
| **SwiftCheckin** | ~$2.7K | 1 | Yes | No (tech→construction) | 3.0/5 | 25-30/100 | -50% + cap at $1M | **$600K-1.0M** |
| **Tandm** | $0 | 0 | MVP | Yes (construction) | 3.0/5 | 35/100 | -42.5% + cap at $800K | **$575K-800K** |
| **ControlShiftAI** | $0 | 0 (2 pilots) | MVP | No (DevOps→trades) | 3.09/5 | 13/100 | -50% + -20% + cap | **$500-750K** |
| **ArcheloLab** | $0 | 0 | MVP (early) | Partial (architecture) | 3.09/5 | 24/100 | -49.5% + cap | **$300-500K** |

### 10.2 Detailed Examples

#### Example A: MyTab (Phase 1a with traction)

**Profile:**
- Hospitality venue management SaaS
- $24K ARR from 16 paying venues
- Founder has hospitality industry background
- Strong founder (FE 4.08) actively doing sales

**Valuation Calculation:**
- **Berkus:** Sound Idea ($600K) + Working Product ($600K) + Quality Founder ($653K = 4.08 × $160K) + Strategic Relationships ($400K) + Early Revenue ($400K) = **$2.65M**
- **Scorecard:** $3.0M × (Founder 1.3 × 30% + Market 1.1 × 20% + Product 1.1 × 15% + ... ) = **$2.8M**
- **Phase 1a Modifiers:** +10% (FE Execution = 4), +5% (industry background) = +15%
- **Reality Check:** Has paying customers → No discount required
- **GTM Modifier:** 35/100 = Emerging = 0%
- **Final Range:** **$2.0M - $3.0M pre-money**

**Assessment:** This feels right. Company has real traction, strong founder, industry fit. Valuation in line with AU pre-seed median.

#### Example B: ControlShiftAI (Phase 1a, zero-traction)

**Profile:**
- AI-powered job management for trades businesses
- $0 ARR, 0 paying customers (2 pilots in progress)
- Founder is DevOps background, NOT from trades industry
- Founder Engine Score 3.09 (developing)

**Valuation Calculation:**
- **Berkus:** Sound Idea ($700K incl AI premium) + Working Product ($500K) + Quality Founder ($494K) + Strategic Relationships ($200K) + Early Revenue ($0) = **$1.89M**
- **Scorecard:** $3.0M × adjusted factors = **$1.7M**
- **Pre-modifier Range:** $1.7M - $1.9M

**Reality Check Applied:**
1. **Zero-Traction Discount:** ARR = $0, Customers = 0 → **-50%** (has product, pilots in progress)
2. **Idea-Stage Cap:** MVP with users in pilot → Cap at **$750K**
3. **Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty:** Founder NOT from trades industry → **-15%**
4. **Override:** None applicable

**Final Calculation:**
- Pre-Reality Check midpoint: $1.8M
- After -50% discount: $900K
- After -15% market fit: $765K
- Capped at: $750K
- **Final Range:** **$500K - $750K pre-money**

**Assessment:** This is dramatically lower than the pre-Reality Check value, but feels more realistic for a company with no revenue, no customers, and founder lacking industry fit.

#### Example C: ArcheloLab (Idea-stage)

**Profile:**
- Lab/architecture workflow tool (early concept)
- $0 ARR, 0 customers, MVP in early development
- Founder has some architecture background (partial fit)
- Founder Engine Score 3.09

**Valuation Calculation:**
- **Berkus:** Sound Idea ($500K) + Working Product ($200K) + Quality Founder ($494K) + Strategic Relationships ($100K) + Early Revenue ($0) = **$1.29M**
- **Scorecard:** $3.0M × adjusted = **$1.5M**
- **Pre-modifier Range:** $1.3M - $1.5M

**Reality Check Applied:**
1. **Zero-Traction Discount:** No revenue, no customers, early product → **-55%**
2. **Idea-Stage Cap:** MVP but early → Cap at **$500K**
3. **Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty:** Partial industry fit → **-5%** (lighter penalty)
4. **Override:** None

**Final Calculation:**
- After -55%: ~$630K
- After -5%: ~$600K
- Capped at: $500K
- **Final Range:** **$300K - $500K pre-money**

**Assessment:** This is essentially idea-stage valuation, which is appropriate given zero traction.

## 11. Questions for Expert Reviewers

### Framework Logic

1. **Is the phase classification model (fit ladder) useful for determining valuation approach?**
   - Does it align with how you think about stage?
   - Are the ARR/customer thresholds appropriate for AU market?

2. **Is the Berkus calibration ($800K/element, $4M max) appropriate for AU 2025?**
   - Too high? Too low?
   - Are the sector adjustments (+$100-200K) reasonable?

3. **Is the Founder Engine Score methodology sound?**
   - Are the 6 dimensions the right ones?
   - Is the Phase 1a weighting (emphasizing Founder-Led Execution) appropriate?
   - Does the linear conversion to Berkus "Quality Founder" make sense?

### Reality Check Calibration

4. **Are the zero-traction discounts (-50% to -70%) in line with what you see in actual deals?**
   - Too harsh? Too lenient?
   - Should the discount be graduated differently?

5. **Are the idea-stage caps ($300K-$800K) realistic?**
   - What do you actually see for idea-stage valuations in AU?
   - Do accelerators/angels deploy at these levels?

6. **Is the enhanced market-fit penalty (-15% to -20%) appropriate?**
   - Does founder industry background matter as much as I'm weighting it?
   - Is the "not from country" penalty relevant in AU context?

### Practical Application

7. **Does the portfolio example output look realistic?**
   - MyTab at $2.0-3.0M with $24K ARR and 16 customers?
   - ControlShiftAI at $500-750K with pilots but no paying customers?
   - ArcheloLab at $300-500K at idea stage?

8. **What am I missing?**
   - Are there common early-stage valuation factors I haven't captured?
   - Are there AU-specific dynamics that should be in the framework?

9. **Would you use this framework (or a version of it)?**
   - What would need to change for you to find it useful?
   - Is it too complex? Too simple?
