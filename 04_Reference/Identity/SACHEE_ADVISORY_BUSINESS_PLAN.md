# Sachee Advisory: Business Plan

**Purpose:** Single reference for positioning, pricing, revenue targets, and strategic approach. Use this to guide sales conversations, client selection, and business decisions.

---

## 1. Practice Overview

**Mission:** Help founder-led B2B SaaS teams build practical GTM systems **and the teams that run them**—from $0 to $10M ARR.

**What makes this different:**

- **Full-Stack Operator:** Not just a GTM strategist—I've built revenue engines, hired and developed teams, and scaled ops simultaneously. At CorePlan, I didn't just design the sales process; I built the Sales, Marketing, CS, and RevOps functions from scratch, hired the people, and created the operating rhythm. This is integrated commercial engine building, not siloed consulting.

- **"First Boots on Ground" Experience:** Repeatedly built GTM engines AND teams from zero:
  - **CorePlan:** Pre-PMF to scale—built integrated commercial engine (Sales, Marketing, CS, RevOps), hired first GTM team members, created playbooks that survived my departure
  - **Sidekicker WA:** First hire and GM—built marketplace supply and demand from scratch, hired and managed local team
  - **UberEATS Perth:** Launch team—built restaurant partnerships, onboarding processes, and early sales motions
  - **Accor Plus:** P&L turnaround—rebuilt underperforming sales team, changed culture, and turned around performance

- **Hard Industry Experience:** Sells to people in steel-capped boots, not just VPs in San Francisco. Deep experience in mining, heavy industry, construction, and marketplaces where you're often making a market, not capturing demand.

- **Integrated Thinking:** GTM, People, and Ops are inseparable. I don't give you a positioning document and wish you luck—I help you build the system AND hire the first person to run it. Strategy without execution capability is useless.

- **Founder-Led Sales as Permanent Capability:** You never "graduate out" of sales as a founder—your role evolves from Engine (doing it) to Engineer (designing it) to Architect (overseeing it). I help you build systems that grow with you.

- **Technical Translator:** Engineer by training (Mechanical Engineering), programmer by practice. Scored 100% in C/C# at uni. Still builds personal tools on weekends (Cursor/Vercel/Supabase). Speaks technical founders' language without needing translation.

- **Radical Transparency:** Documents the real cost of building—burnout, career earthquakes, "Yeah Nah" early adopters. Anti-guru positioning. Founders trust someone who admits it's hard.

**Core focus:** B2B SaaS founders (0-10M ARR) in vertical, complex, or under-digitised markets.

## 2. Target Market & Client Selection

### Phase Model (Where Clients Sit)

| Phase | ARR Band | Customer Count | Primary GTM Goal | Fit Focus |
|-------|----------|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| **1a** | 0-50K | 0-10 | Prove people will pay | Problem-solution fit |
| **1b** | 50-200K | 10-30 | Make GTM repeatable | Early product-market fit |
| **2** | 200K-1M | 30-100 | Founder-led → team-supported | Go-to-market fit |
| **3** | 1M-10M | 100+ | Scale without breaking | Ops fit |

**Current focus: Phase 1a/1b (<$200K ARR) via equity.** This is deliberate strategy, not charity:

1. **Build equity portfolio** – Upside from 3-5 companies reaching $1M ARR dwarfs hourly consulting
2. **Validate and refine playbooks** – Real reps with real companies to prove frameworks work
3. **Build credibility for Phase 2/3** – Case studies, testimonials, and track record to command premium fees later

The goal is to graduate into **Phase 2/3 cash engagements** ($5K+/month) once the portfolio and proof points are established.

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

*The ICP describes the ideal client at maturity—who you're building toward serving at premium cash rates.*

Early-stage B2B SaaS and tech-enabled marketplace founders who:
- Are in **Phase 2** (200K-1M ARR) with traction but need to scale beyond founder-led
- Operate in **vertical or complex B2B markets** (mining, heavy industry, construction, regulated sectors)
- Sell **high-ACV products** with multi-stakeholder buying groups and long sales cycles (3-12 months)
- Have **founder-led or founder-involved sales** as the core GTM motion
- Want a **practical operating system**—not random tactics or generic SaaS playbooks
- Are in **under-digitised industries** where you're often making a market, not just capturing demand

**Environment fit:** High-value, technically complex products. Long sales cycles. Industries slow to change. Buyers who compare you to spreadsheets and legacy tools, not other SaaS.

### Early Customer Profile (ECP)

*The ECP describes who you're working with NOW via equity—the stepping stone to ICP.*

Founders who feel the pain **most acutely right now** and will move fast:
- In **Phase 1a/1b** (<$200K ARR) with first customers but no clear pattern yet
- Running into **stalled growth or "random wins"** and can't figure out why
- Struggling to convert early traction into a **repeatable GTM motion**
- Overwhelmed by **conflicting advice** about sales, marketing, and hiring
- Willing to invest time and attention into **structured GTM work** (coachable, not looking for silver bullets)
- **Willing to offer meaningful equity** (2-12%) in exchange for hands-on GTM partnership

**ECP mindset:** These are innovators and early adopters who tolerate rough edges because you solve a painful problem. They'll work around issues because the value is clear. They don't need polish—they need their problem solved NOW.

**Why ECP matters:** ECPs are your current focus. They provide equity upside, real reps to validate playbooks, and case studies to build credibility for Phase 2/3 cash clients.

### Client Fit Criteria

**Must have:**
- Revenue ambition (not a lifestyle business)
- Willingness to do the work (coachable, not looking for someone to do it for them)
- Founder available for 1:1 sessions (not delegating to a junior)

**Watch for (yellow flags):**
- No urgency ("we'll get around to it")
- Looking for a silver bullet ("just tell me what to say")
- No budget AND no willingness to offer equity

**Not a fit:**
- B2C consumer products
- Pure marketplaces without B2B component
- "Just need leads" requests (need strategy, not tactics)

## 3. Service Offerings & Pricing

### How I Work: Integrated Commercial Engine Building

I don't separate "GTM strategy" from "team building" from "ops." They're the same problem.

When I work with founders, I help you:
1. **Design the engine** – ICP, positioning, sales process, pricing, content strategy
2. **Build the engine** – CRM setup, playbooks, templates, metrics
3. **Hire the team** – First GTM roles, interview loops, onboarding, "bar raiser" support
4. **Create the operating rhythm** – Weekly cadences, review processes, escalation paths

The goal: You end up with a system that works AND a person (or people) who can run it without you in every meeting.

### The Entry Point (All Clients)

| Service | Price | Duration | What You Get |
|---------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **GTM Health Check** | Free | 30 min | Rapid assessment of revenue bottlenecks, current phase, and GTM gaps |
| **GTM Diagnostic** | $5-8K AUD | ~2 weeks | Deep-dive audit of ICP, positioning, messaging, sales process using the GTM Strategy Workbook |

### For Startups <$200K ARR: The "Operator Capital" Model

I operate like a VC, but instead of giving cash, I invest **Execution Capital**—18 years of operational rigor (UberEats, Sidekicker, CorePlan) to build your GTM engine, ops, and first key hires.

**Zero cash fees. 100% equity. Aligned incentives.**

| Engagement | Equity | Time | What I Do |
|------------|--------|------|-----------|
| **Active Advisor** | 2-4% | ~2-4 hrs/week | GTM strategy, first hire support (bar raiser, interview loops), early org design, ops review, ICP definition |
| **Fractional Co-Founder Sprint** | 6-12% | ~1.5-2 days/week | Build & close pipeline, design GTM playbooks, run hiring loops for first GTM hires, create role specs, hire my replacement |

**Vesting:** Monthly, no cliff. **Performance Acceleration:** 100% vests immediately upon hitting $1M ARR or raising >$1.5M.

**The "Graduation" Trigger:** Once milestone hit, equity is fully earned. Engagement transitions to cash retainer ($5-10K/month) if ongoing support needed. No more equity dilution.

### For Startups >$200K ARR: Cash Model

| Service | Price | Duration | What You Get |
|---------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **GTM Advisory** | $3-5K/month | Monthly retainer | Weekly calls, async/Slack support, ongoing strategic partnership |
| **GTM Copilot** | Custom | Monthly retainer | Fractional GTM leadership with hands-on execution hours |
| **Strategic Projects** | $5-15K | 4-8 weeks | Positioning sprints, pricing projects, sales framework design |
| **Team Scaling Sprint** | $8-15K | 4-6 weeks | First GTM hire support—role design, job specs, interview process, candidate evaluation, onboarding plan |

### Pricing Policy Summary (Valid through June 30, 2026)

| Client ARR | Model | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **<$200K ARR** | Equity only (2-12%) | Cash is their scarcest resource. I take the risk with them. |
| **>$200K ARR** | Cash ($3-5K+/month) | They have revenue. Pay market rate to preserve cap table. |
| **Post-Milestone** | Cash retainer | Equity stops. Protect founder dilution for Series A. |

## 4. Revenue Model

### Year 1 Target: $80K AUD (Cash)

**Reality check:** Most Y1 engagements will be equity deals with <$200K ARR startups. Cash revenue comes from:

| Engagement Type | Quantity | Revenue |
|-----------------|----------|---------|
| Diagnostics (any stage) | 2-3 | $10-24K |
| Advisory retainers (>$200K ARR) | 1-2 | $36-60K (annualized) |
| Strategic Projects | 1-2 | $10-30K |
| **Total (cash)** | | **$56-114K** |

**Equity portfolio (not counted in Y1 cash target):**

| Engagement Type | Quantity | Equity Range | Upside Scenario |
|-----------------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Active Advisor | 2-3 | 2-4% each | $20-40K per company at $1M ARR |
| Fractional Co-Founder | 1-2 | 6-12% each | $60-120K per company at $1M ARR |

**The real game:** If 2-3 equity companies hit $1M ARR in 3-5 years, the portfolio value dwarfs any Y1 cash target. Cash covers operating costs; equity builds wealth.

### Capacity

- **Equity deals:** 2-3 Active Advisor + 1 Fractional Co-Founder max (time-intensive)
- **Cash deals:** Can stack Diagnostics and Projects alongside equity work
- Total active engagements: ~3-4 at any time (mix of equity + cash)

---

### Sales Process

**For <$200K ARR (Equity Path):**
```
Health Check (Free) → Vetting/Fit Assessment → Equity Agreement → Active Advisor or Fractional Co-Founder
```

**For >$200K ARR (Cash Path):**
```
Health Check (Free) → Diagnostic ($5-8K) → Advisory/Copilot (Retainer)
```

**Sales Motions:**
- Health Check qualifies fit and demonstrates value
- Vetting for equity deals is more rigorous (founder quality, market, commitment)
- Diagnostic proves methodology and builds trust (cash clients)
- Advisory/Copilot is natural next step for clients who want ongoing support
- Team Scaling Sprint can be added to any engagement or sold standalone

## 6. Operating Principles

These principles (documented in `04_Reference/SACHEE_ISMS_OPERATING_PRINCIPLES.md`) guide all decisions:

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **"Speed is our weapon"** | Move fast on opportunities. 24-hour response times. Same-week calls. |
| **"Do things that don't scale"** | For first 10 clients, forget automation. Personal touch, deep attention. |
| **"Save the cheerleader, save the world"** | Focus on a tight beachhead segment (vertical SaaS, AU/NZ founders). |
| **"Always solve for the customer"** | When in doubt, ask: What's best for this founder? |
| **"People buy from people, not logos"** | Founder-led content and presence beats faceless brand marketing. |
