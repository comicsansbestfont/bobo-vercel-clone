# Sachee Content Strategy: The Operator-Advisor Playbook

**Version:** 2.0
**Last Updated:** December 1, 2025
**Author:** Sachee Perera
**Status:** Final

---

## Executive Summary

This document is the comprehensive content strategy for Sachee Advisory, reflecting the strategic repositioning from "GTM Advisor" to **"Operator-Advisor"** - someone who builds both revenue engines AND the teams that run them.

**The Core Insight:** Sachee's deepest expertise is not just GTM strategy - it's the messy, human work of building commercial teams, managing performance, preventing burnout, and scaling from founder-led to team-led operations. This is the underserved angle that differentiates from crowded "fractional CRO" positioning.

**What's New in V2:**
- Two new content pillars: **People & Team Scaling** and **Operator Psychology**
- Explicit ECP vs ICP audience segmentation with content mapped to each
- Story-first content philosophy (frameworks buried in narratives)
- 90-day content plan with specific topic sequences
- Updated format hierarchy based on 2025 LinkedIn algorithm

## 1. Content Mission & Goals

### 1.1 The Mission

**Mission Statement:**
> Teach early-stage B2B SaaS founders how to build practical, founder-led GTM systems through honest storytelling, applied frameworks, and hard-won operational lessons - so they can stop guessing and start selling.

**The Promise:**
Every piece of content should leave the reader with:
1. A specific insight they can apply TODAY
2. Trust that Sachee has actually done this (not just read about it)
3. Clarity on where they are and what to do next

### 1.2 Business Goals

| Goal | Metric | Target (90 Days) |
|------|--------|------------------|
| Build demand with right founders | Qualified inbound DMs/month | 10-15 |
| Convert to conversations | GTM Health Checks booked/month | 4-6 |
| Establish authority | Content engagement rate | 1.5%+ |
| Grow right audience | New followers (founder/SaaS titles) | 50-100/month |
| Generate case study pipeline | Active equity clients | 3-5 |

### 1.3 What Success Looks Like

**Lagging Indicators (3-6 months):**
- Inbound leads saying "I've been following your content for a while"
- Founders referencing specific posts in discovery calls
- Speaking invitations based on content themes
- Clients asking for help with topics we've written about

**Leading Indicators (Weekly):**
- Comments from founders (not just network contacts)
- Saves on tactical posts (indicates actionable value)
- DMs asking follow-up questions
- Shares with added commentary

---

## 2. Audience Segmentation

### 2.1 Strategic Context

**The Dilemma:** Content must serve two distinct audiences with different needs and willingness to pay:

| Dimension | ECP (Early Customer Profile) | ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) |
|-----------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Stage** | Phase 1a/1b (<$200K ARR) | Phase 2+ (>$200K ARR) |
| **Current Focus** | Primary (equity clients) | Secondary (future cash clients) |
| **Problem State** | "How do I get my first customers?" | "How do I scale beyond me?" |
| **Budget** | Equity-rich, cash-poor | Cash available for advisory |
| **Decision Speed** | Fast (desperate for help) | Slower (more at stake) |
| **Content Need** | Foundational frameworks, courage | Advanced execution, team building |

### 2.2 Primary Audience: ECP (Current Focus)

**Who They Are:**
- Pre-revenue to $200K ARR B2B SaaS founders
- Usually technical or product backgrounds
- First-time founders or first time selling B2B
- Solo or with 1-2 co-founders, no dedicated commercial team
- Often in "random wins" phase with no clear pattern

**Where They Are (Geography):**
- Australia and New Zealand (primary)
- Remote/distributed teams building for ANZ market

**Industries (Overlap with Sachee's experience):**
- Vertical SaaS (any industry, especially hard/industrial)
- Tech-enabled services and marketplaces
- Complex B2B with long sales cycles
- Enterprise or prosumer models

**Content Needs (What They're Searching For):**
1. "How do I get my first 10 customers?"
2. "Am I doing founder-led sales right?"
3. "How do I know if I have product-market fit?"
4. "Should I hire a salesperson yet?"
5. "How do I not burn out doing everything myself?"

**Emotional State:**
- Overwhelmed by conflicting advice
- Frustrated by slow progress
- Anxious about running out of runway
- Desperate for something that "just works"
- Lonely (no one else understands)

### 2.3 Secondary Audience: ICP (Future Focus)

**Who They Are:**
- $200K-$1M ARR B2B SaaS founders
- Have traction but struggling to scale beyond founder-led
- Thinking about first commercial hire(s)
- Need to systematize what's been working ad-hoc
- Ready to invest cash in GTM help

**Content Needs:**
1. "How do I hire my first salesperson?"
2. "How do I build a repeatable sales process?"
3. "How do I stop being the bottleneck?"
4. "How do I know what to delegate vs keep?"
5. "How do I manage performance when I've never done it?"

**Why We Create for Them Now:**
- Seeds planted today → cash clients in 6-12 months
- Their content needs overlap with ECP (foundational → advanced)
- Building authority for when they're ready to pay

### 2.4 Content Mapping by Audience

| Content Type | ECP Focus | ICP Focus |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Founder Stories | "Here's how I felt" | "Here's what I did" |
| Frameworks | "Start here" | "Here's the advanced version" |
| Case Studies | "This is possible" | "Here's how you replicate it" |
| Psychology | "You're not alone" | "Here's how to manage yourself" |
| Team Building | N/A (too early) | "Here's how to hire/manage" |

---

### 3.2 Pillar Deep Dives

---

#### PILLAR 1: Founder Stories & Psychology

**Description:**
The emotional, vulnerable, human side of building a company. This is Sachee's highest-performing content type - 10-100x better engagement than pure frameworks.

**Why It Works:**
- Algorithm rewards authentic, human stories
- Readers see themselves in the struggle
- Builds trust before expertise
- Cuts through AI-generated noise

**Core Topics:**
| Topic | Angle | Story Source |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| Burnout and recovery | The cost of building | CorePlan years |
| Career earthquakes | When everything changes | Advisory transition |
| Imposter syndrome | "Who am I to charge for this?" | Starting advisory |
| The loneliness of founders | No one else gets it | All roles |
| Identity beyond the startup | When you leave | CorePlan exit |
| The weight of responsibility | Carrying the team | COO experience |

**Content Mix:**
- 60% Story posts (personal narrative + lesson)
- 25% Pattern posts (observation from client work)
- 15% Behind-the-scenes (weekly work, learning)

**Proof Points:**
- CorePlan farewell post: 10.9K impressions, 234 reactions, 62 comments
- Life update post: 12.9K impressions, 235 reactions, 32 comments
- Burnout trade-off: 8.3K impressions, 72 reactions, 9 comments

---

#### PILLAR 2: GTM in Hard Industries

**Description:**
Mining, drilling, construction, and heavy industry as a "vertical lab" for SaaS founders. Not mining content FOR mining people - but mining stories as PROOF for SaaS founders.

**Why It Works:**
- Unique differentiation (no one else owns this lane)
- Rich, specific examples beat generic advice
- Shows "I've done hard things"
- Appeals to anyone selling into complex B2B

**Core Topics:**
| Topic | Angle | Story Source |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| "Yeah Nah" customers | Early adopters who tell the truth | Drilling contractors |
| Selling to operators | Non-digital buyers, field-first | CorePlan deals |

| Long sales cycles | Enterprise patience | Mining company deals |
| Multi-stakeholder deals | Who's really the buyer? | All enterprise work |
| Building in regulated industries | Compliance as feature | Mining safety |

**Content Mix:**
- 50% Story posts (specific customer stories)
- 30% Pattern posts (what I noticed across deals)
- 20% Framework posts (how to apply this)

**Reframing Rule:**
Every mining/industry story MUST be framed as lesson for SaaS founders.
- BAD hook: "At the ADIA sundowner last week..."
- GOOD hook: "If your early customers are being polite, your startup is dying."

---

#### PILLAR 3: Positioning & Strategy (Applied)

| Positioning in crowded markets | When they zig, we zag | CorePlan vs construction tools |

**Content Mix:**
- 40% Story-wrapped frameworks
- 30% Case study breakdowns
- 20% Contrarian takes
- 10% Pure frameworks (carousel format only)

**Format Rule:**
Pure frameworks ONLY work as carousels or images. Never as text-only posts.

---

#### PILLAR 4: Sales Motions & Presales

**Core Topics:**
| Topic | Angle | Story Source |

---

#### PILLAR 6: People & Team Scaling (NEW)

**Description:**
The human side of GTM scaling. First hires, performance management, coaching, culture. The expertise Sachee built at CorePlan but hasn't been writing about.

**Why It Works:**
- HUGE unmet need (most GTM content ignores people)

- 10% Contrarian takes

**Launch Priority:** HIGH - This fills a major gap and positions Operator-Advisor angle.

---

#### PILLAR 7: Operator Psychology (NEW)

**Description:**
The internal experience of being an operator. Burnout prevention, context-switching, founder-as-CEO transition, identity work. The stuff no one talks about but everyone feels.

**Why It Works:**
- Highest-resonance content type (see Pillar 1 performance)
- No one else is writing this for B2B SaaS founders
- Builds deep trust and relatability

**Core Topics:**

### 3.3 Pillar Rotation (Weekly)

A balanced week might include:

| Wednesday | People/Team (6) OR Sales (4) | Hard Industries (2) | Framework + story |
| Friday | Positioning (3) OR Psychology (7) | Content/Outbound (5) | Pattern observation |

**Rule:** Never go more than 2 weeks without touching each pillar.

---

## 4. Content Themes & Topics (Priority Queue)

### 4.1 High-Impact Missing Topics

---

## 5. Content Formats

### 5.1 Format Hierarchy (2025 Algorithm)

Based on LinkedIn's current algorithm and Sachee's performance data:

| Format | Reach Multiplier | Best For | Cadence Target |
|--------|------------------|----------|----------------|
| Text + Image | 1.5x | Story posts, insights | 2x/week |
| Carousel (PDF) | 1.4x | Frameworks, step-by-step | 2x/month |
| Short Vertical Video (45-60s) | 1.3x | Personal stories, hot takes | 1-2x/month (test) |
| Text Only | 0.88x | Personal updates only | 1x/week max |
| External Link (body) | 0.5x | Never use | Never |
| External Link (comment) | 0.7x | Blog/resource CTAs | When needed |

### 5.2 Format Guidelines

**Text + Image (Default):**
- Story posts with single strong image
- 800-1,400 characters
- Image stops scroll; text delivers value
- Examples: Event photos, quote graphics, simple diagrams

**Carousels:**
- 5-7 slides maximum
- One idea per slide
- Large text, minimal design
- Always include CTA on last slide
- Best for: frameworks, checklists, step-by-step

**Video (Testing Phase):**
- 45-60 seconds maximum
- Phone-recorded, authentic (not polished)
- Hook in first 3 seconds
- Captions mandatory
- Best for: hot takes, personal stories

**Text Only (Use Sparingly):**
- Reserve for deeply personal posts
- Burnout, career transitions, major announcements
- No more than 1x/week

### 5.3 Format by Pillar

| Pillar | Primary Format | Secondary Format |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| Founder Stories (1) | Text + Image | Video |
| Hard Industries (2) | Text + Image | Carousel |
| Positioning (3) | Carousel | Text + Image |
| Sales (4) | Text + Image | Carousel |
| Content/Outbound (5) | Text + Image | Behind-scenes |
| People/Team (6) | Text + Image | Carousel |
| Psychology (7) | Text Only | Video |

---

## 6. Distribution Strategy

### 6.1 Platform Priority

| Platform | Priority | Role | Cadence |
|----------|----------|------|---------|
| LinkedIn (personal) | PRIMARY | Demand generation, trust building | 2-4 posts/week |
| Website Blog | SECONDARY | SEO, long-form, resource hosting | 2-4x/month |
| Newsletter (future) | TERTIARY | Nurture, deepening relationship | TBD |
| Speaking/Events | OPPORTUNISTIC | Authority, network, content fuel | As invited |

### 6.2 LinkedIn Strategy

**Posting Cadence:**
- Target: 2-4 posts/week
- Minimum: 2 posts/week
- Maximum: 5 posts/week (avoid over-posting)
- Spacing: Minimum 12 hours between posts

**Optimal Timing (ANZ Audience):**
- Morning: 7-9am AEST (professionals scrolling before work)
- Lunch: 12-1pm AEST (break time browsing)
- Best days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- Avoid: Late Sunday, Monday morning

**Engagement Strategy:**

*Pre-Post (15-20 minutes):*
1. Comment on 3-5 AU/NZ founder posts
2. 15+ word comments (not "great post")
3. Add genuine value or challenge
4. Focus on people you want to connect with

*Post-Launch (60-90 minutes):*
1. Stay online and watch for comments
2. Reply to EVERY comment within 90 minutes
3. Ask follow-up questions to create threads
4. Like all comments quickly

*Ongoing:*
1. Check comments 2-3x on publish day
2. Turn good commenters into DM conversations
3. Note who's engaging consistently (potential clients)

**CTAs (Designed for Comments + Saves):**

Good CTAs:
- "Comment [WORD] if you've experienced this and tell me your situation"
- "Comment [WORD] if you want the one-pager I use with founders"
- "Save this if it's useful - I post more like this every week"

Bad CTAs:
- "Like if you agree" (engagement bait)
- "Comment YES to get the PDF" (spam trigger)
- Generic "thoughts?" (no specific ask)

### 6.3 Blog/Website Strategy

**Purpose:**
- Host long-form frameworks and guides
- SEO for inbound discovery
- Link-out destination (blog link in comments, not body)
- Resource hosting for lead magnets

**Content Types:**
- Deep dives on frameworks (2,000-4,000 words)
- Case studies (1,500-2,500 words)
- Resource guides (checklists, templates)

**Publishing Flow:**
1. LinkedIn post tests the idea
2. High-performing posts become blog candidates
3. Blog expands on the idea with more detail
4. Blog becomes resource referenced in future posts

### 6.4 Paid Amplification (Minimal, Strategic)

**Philosophy (from GTM Workbook):**
For Phase 1a/1b companies, "marketing" = positioning + founder-led content + outbound. Paid should be used sparingly.

**Rules:**
1. NEVER boost underperforming posts
2. Only amplify posts with proven organic success (1.5%+ engagement)
3. Use Thought Leader Ads (personal profile, not company page)
4. Target: Founder/Co-founder titles, 1-50 employees, AU/NZ
5. Goal: Familiarity and trust, not immediate conversion

**Budget:** $200-500/month testing, scale based on results

## 8. Voice & Style Guide

### 8.1 Tone Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct** | No fluff, get to the point | "Here's the truth:" not "I think maybe..." |
| **Grounded** | Rooted in experience, not theory | "When I did this at CorePlan..." |
| **Contrarian** | Challenge consensus when warranted | "Everyone says X. Here's why that's wrong." |
| **Warm** | Approachable, not arrogant | "I made this mistake too" |
| **Specific** | Concrete details over vague claims | "$200K ARR in 6 months" not "rapid growth" |

### 8.2 Writing Principles

**"Stupidly Obvious + Highly Detailed"**
- Headlines should be immediately clear (no clever wordplay)
- Body should be deeply specific (numbers, steps, examples)

**Story First, Framework Second**
- Lead with personal narrative or client story
- Embed the lesson/framework within the story
- Never start with "Today I want to talk about..."

**First Person, Singular**
- "I" not "we" (even when referencing CorePlan work)
- Personal voice builds trust
- Company voice sounds corporate

**Short Sentences, Lots of Air**
- 4th-6th grade reading level
- No paragraph longer than 3-4 lines
- Single idea per paragraph
- Plenty of line breaks

### 8.3 Hook Formula

**First 140 Characters (Above the Fold):**
1. Name the audience OR
2. State a provocative truth OR
3. Open with specific moment

**Good Hooks:**
- "If you're an Aussie SaaS founder under $200K ARR..."
- "If your early customers are being polite, your startup is dying."
- "Last Tuesday, I watched a founder realize he'd been solving the wrong problem."

**Bad Hooks:**
- "I've been thinking about strategy lately."
- "Here's a thread on GTM basics."
- "At the ADIA sundowner last week..." (buries the lesson)

### 8.4 Do's and Don'ts

**DO:**
- Use specific numbers and timeframes
- Reference real stories and experiences
- Challenge conventional wisdom
- Show vulnerability and mistakes
- End with actionable next step
- Use Aussie-isms naturally (yeah nah, arvo, etc.)

**DON'T:**
- Use corporate buzzwords ("synergies", "leverage")
- Write generic advice that could apply to anyone
- Lecture or teach from above
- Hide behind "we" when "I" is accurate
- Use hashtags excessively (max 3-5)
- Start with "I want to talk about..."

### 8.5 Sachee-isms to Reinforce

These phrases should appear regularly across content:

- "Speed is our weapon"
- "Save the cheerleader, save the world"
- "Stupidly obvious + highly detailed"
- "Do things that don't scale"
- "People buy from people, not logos"
- "Meet the customer where they're at"
- "When they zig, we zag"
- "Lead, don't take orders"

Each Sachee-ism is a potential post topic (expand on the principle with a story).

### 10.2 Performance Review Ritual

**Weekly (5 minutes):**

- Which post underperformed? Why?
- Any DMs or comments worth following up?

**Monthly (30 minutes):**
- Pull analytics for all posts

- Update pillar priorities if needed
- Refill content queue

**Quarterly (1 hour):**
- Review all metrics vs targets
- Assess pillar balance
- Plan next quarter's themes
- Update this strategy doc if needed

### 10.3 What to Stop, Start, Continue

**If a post type consistently underperforms (3+ attempts):**
1. Try different format (text-only → carousel)
2. Try different hook angle
3. Try story-wrapping
4. If still fails, deprioritize the topic

**If a post type overperforms:**
1. Create follow-up content
2. Consider series expansion
3. Test blog version
4. Use as template for similar posts
