## 1. Executive Summary

### The Strategic Shift

Sachee Advisory is repositioning from "GTM Advisor" to "Operator-Advisor" - a fundamental shift that unlocks Sachee's full experience and creates defensible differentiation in a crowded advisory market.

**Current Positioning:**
"B2B SaaS GTM Advisor helping founders from 0-10M ARR"

**New Positioning:**
"Operator-Advisor who builds integrated commercial engines AND the teams that run them - for B2B SaaS founders in complex, under-digitized markets"

### Why This Shift Now

1. **Market Crowding:** The "GTM Advisor" category is saturated with ex-VPs and coaches. Differentiation through GTM expertise alone is increasingly difficult.

2. **Underleveraged Experience:** Sachee's operator background extends far beyond GTM:
   - Led 20-30 direct reports at peak
   - P&L turnaround at Accor Plus (71.67% renewal rate, highest in APAC)
   - Built entire commercial functions at CorePlan (Sales, Marketing, CS, RevOps)
   - "First boots on ground" at UberEATS Perth, Sidekicker, CorePlan
   - "Hiring bar raiser" and team scaling experience
   - Deep experience in hard industries (mining, construction, field ops)

3. **White Space Opportunity:** Few advisors credibly span GTM + People/Ops. This intersection is where most Phase 2+ founders struggle.

4. **Portfolio Strategy Alignment:** The equity model (<$200K ARR) requires hands-on involvement that goes beyond GTM advice - team building, ops, and culture are table stakes.

### Strategic Objectives (12-Month Horizon)

| Objective | Target | Why It Matters |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Build ECP equity portfolio | 3-5 active engagements | Validate playbooks, build case studies, create equity upside |
| Establish ICP pipeline | 2-3 cash clients >$200K ARR | Revenue foundation for sustainability |
| Grow qualified audience | 500+ relevant LinkedIn followers | Trust at scale before you have brand |
| Validate positioning | 50+ discovery conversations | Real-world feedback on "Operator-Advisor" resonance |

## 2. Market Analysis

### 2.1 Target Market Definition

#### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) - Future Cash Clients

The ICP describes who Sachee is building toward serving at premium cash rates.

| Dimension | ICP Criteria |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Stage** | Phase 2+ (>$200K ARR, 30-100 customers) |
| **Model** | B2B SaaS or tech-enabled marketplaces |
| **Market Type** | Vertical SaaS, complex B2B, under-digitized industries |
| **Sales Motion** | High-ACV ($20K+ deals), multi-stakeholder, 3-12 month cycles |
| **Geography** | Australia and New Zealand (primary) |
| **Founder Profile** | Technical/product-led founders hitting GTM ceiling |
| **Pain Point** | Transitioning from founder-led to team-supported GTM |
| **Budget** | $3-8K/month for advisory, $5-15K for projects |

**Why Phase 2+ is the ICP:**
- They have validated the market and have real revenue
- They can pay cash at premium rates
- They need what Sachee does best: building systems and teams
- Larger deal sizes justify the engagement economics

#### Early Customer Profile (ECP) - Current Equity Focus

The ECP describes who Sachee is working with NOW via equity - the stepping stone to ICP.

| Dimension | ECP Criteria |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Stage** | Phase 1a/1b (<$200K ARR, 0-30 customers) |
| **Model** | B2B SaaS, tech-enabled services |
| **Market Type** | Vertical or complex B2B (similar to ICP) |
| **Founder Profile** | First-time or early-stage founders, coachable |
| **Pain Point** | Stuck on first 10-30 customers, random wins, no pattern |
| **Engagement Model** | Equity only (2-12%) |
| **Commitment** | Willing to invest time and attention (not looking for silver bullets) |

**Why ECP Matters:**
- ECPs provide equity upside if they hit milestones
- Real reps to validate playbooks and frameworks
- Case studies to build credibility for ICP clients
- Lower risk for founders (no cash outlay)

#### Strategic Rationale: Two-Track Model

```
ECP (<$200K ARR)              ICP (>$200K ARR)
     |                              |

     v                              |
Graduation trigger: $1M ARR, $1.5M+ raise
     |______________________________|
              |
              v
       Equity vests + transition to cash retainer
```

### 2.2 Competitive Landscape

#### Direct Competitors

| Competitor Type | Who They Are | Their Positioning | Sachee's Advantage |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Fractional CROs** | Ex-VP Sales from scale-ups | "I'll build your sales team" | Too narrow, too expensive, too early for Phase 1 |
| **GTM Coaches** | SaaS veterans, consultants | "Frameworks and accountability" | Too high-level, lack hands-on operator experience |
| **Accelerator Programs** | Y Combinator, Startmate | "Cohort-based, broad playbooks" | Not tailored, time-limited, US-centric |
| **Solo Advisors** | Ex-founders, operators | "I've done it before" | Lack codified frameworks, inconsistent engagement |

#### Indirect Competitors

| Competitor Type | Why Founders Choose Them | Gap Sachee Fills |
|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| **Hiring a VP Sales** | "We need someone senior" | Too early - creates buffer from market truth |
| **DIY + Content** | "We'll figure it out" | Random tactics, no integrated system |
| **VC Partners** | "They have portfolio support" | Spread thin, generic advice, not in the trenches |
| **Management Consultants** | "We need strategy" | Expensive, PowerPoint-heavy, lack execution |

### 2.3 Market White Space Opportunity

The white space exists at the intersection of three dimensions:

```
                    GTM STRATEGY
                         |
                         |
        ----------------+----------------
       |                |                |
       |    WHITE       |                |
       |    SPACE       |                |
       |                |                |
PEOPLE & TEAM --------- + ---------- OPERATIONS
       |                |                |
       |                |                |
       |                |                |
        ----------------+----------------
                         |
                         |
```

**Where competitors cluster:**
- **GTM-only:** Fractional CROs, sales coaches, demand gen consultants
- **Ops-only:** Revenue operations consultants, process specialists
- **People-only:** Fractional CHROs, executive recruiters, culture consultants

**Where Sachee uniquely operates:**
- **GTM + People:** Build the engine AND hire the people to run it
- **GTM + Ops:** Design the process AND the systems that support it
- **All three:** Integrated commercial engine that doesn't break when founders step back

**Why this white space exists:**

1. **Specialization bias:** Advisory tends toward narrow expertise ("the sales guy," "the hiring expert")
2. **Operator scarcity:** Most advisors advise; they don't operate
3. **Integrated thinking is rare:** Connecting GTM, people, and ops requires lived experience across all three
4. **Hard industries filter:** Mining, construction, and field ops experience is uncommon in advisory

---

## 3. Positioning Strategy

### 3.1 Current vs. New Positioning

| Dimension | Current Positioning | New Positioning |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Label** | GTM Advisor | Operator-Advisor |
| **Scope** | Go-to-market strategy | Commercial engine + teams |
| **Depth** | Strategy + frameworks | Strategy + execution + people |
| **Experience Frame** | CorePlan GTM | Full operator journey (telco to mining) |
| **Differentiator** | SPICED, founder-led sales | "First Boots on Ground" operator |
| **Category** | GTM consulting | "Operator Capital" (new) |

### 3.2 Key Differentiators

**1. "First Boots on Ground" Operator**

Not a consultant who advises from the sidelines. A proven operator who has:
- Launched UberEATS Perth (early team, restaurant partnerships)
- Built Sidekicker WA from scratch (dual-sided marketplace)
- Turned around Accor Plus (71.67% renewal rate, highest APAC)
- Built CorePlan's entire commercial engine (Sales, Marketing, CS, RevOps)

**Proof Point:** Every major role involved building something from zero or turning around something broken.

**2. Technical Translator**

Engineer by training, GTM by choice:
- Mechanical Engineering degree
- 100% in university programming (C, C#)
- Built complete stock management system in Visual Basic (high school)
- Maintains technical empathy through building personal tools (Lovabo)

**Why It Matters:** Technical founders don't need advice dumbed down. They need someone who thinks in systems and can translate between product and revenue.

**3. Radical Transparency**

Anti-guru, anti-hype approach:
- Documents the real cost of building (not just wins)
- Shares mistakes and lessons publicly
- Rejects "10x growth" promises for "what's good enough now"

**Why It Matters:** Founders are exhausted by performance marketing advisors. Honesty builds trust.

**4. Integrated Thinking (GTM + People + Ops)**

Not siloed advice, but connected systems:
- GTM strategy that accounts for who will execute it
- Hiring frameworks that match go-to-market stage
- Ops processes that support revenue without breaking product

**Why It Matters:** Most startups break at the handoffs between GTM, people, and ops. Sachee builds them as one system.

**5. Hard Industries Experience**

Deep experience in under-digitized, high-stakes markets:
- Mining and resources
- Construction and trades
- Hospitality and field operations

**Why It Matters:** These markets don't respond to typical SaaS playbooks. Buyers are skeptical, sales cycles are long, and every interaction matters.

### 3.3 Positioning Statement

**For:**
Early-stage B2B SaaS founders (especially in vertical and complex B2B markets) in Australia and New Zealand

**Who:**
Are stuck translating product traction into repeatable revenue and can't figure out what to build first - the GTM motion, the team, or the operations

**Sachee is:**
An Operator-Advisor who doesn't just give advice - he builds integrated commercial engines AND the teams that run them

**Unlike:**
Fractional CROs who only focus on sales, or coaches who only give frameworks

**Sachee:**
Has been "first boots on ground" in hard industries (mining, marketplaces, hospitality) - building, not advising - which means the playbooks he uses are battle-tested, not theoretical

### 3.4 Category Creation: "Operator Capital"

**The Concept:**

Sachee operates like a VC, but instead of giving cash, he invests **Execution Capital** - 18 years of operational rigor to build GTM engines, ops, and first key hires.

**Why This Frame Works:**

1. **Removes cash friction:** Early-stage founders can't afford $5-8K/month advisors
2. **Creates aligned incentives:** Equity means Sachee wins when they win
3. **Signals commitment:** Not a retainer relationship; a true partnership
4. **Differentiates from coaches:** Advisors give advice; operators invest time and reputation

**Operator Capital Offering:**

| Tier | Equity | Time | Focus |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| **Active Advisor** | 2-4% | ~2-4 hrs/week | GTM strategy, hiring bar raiser, ops review, ICP definition |
| **Fractional Co-Founder Sprint** | 6-12% | ~1.5-2 days/week | Close first deals, build CRM/playbooks, run interview loops, hire replacement |

**Vesting:** Monthly, no cliff
**Performance Acceleration:** 100% vests immediately upon hitting $1M ARR or raising >$1.5M
**Graduation:** Engagement transitions to cash retainer ($5-10K/month) if ongoing support needed

### 3.5 Positioning Ladder: How the Message Evolves

| Audience Familiarity | Positioning Message |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Cold (never heard of Sachee)** | "I help B2B SaaS founders in hard industries get their first 30 customers without hiring a sales team" |
| **Aware (seen content, engaged)** | "I build integrated commercial engines for vertical SaaS - GTM, team, and ops as one system" |
| **Considering (in conversation)** | "I'm an operator who invests time instead of cash - 18 years of experience in exchange for equity in the right companies" |
| **Evaluating (comparing options)** | "I've built from zero at CorePlan, Sidekicker, UberEATS, and Accor Plus. I don't advise - I do" |

---

## 4. Messaging Framework

### 4.1 Primary Value Proposition

**Core Value Proposition:**

> "I help B2B SaaS founders in complex, under-digitized markets build practical GTM systems - and the teams that run them - from $0 to $10M ARR."

**Extended Value Proposition (for engaged prospects):**

> "I'm an operator who has been 'first boots on ground' at UberEATS, Sidekicker, Accor Plus, and CorePlan. I don't give you advice from the sidelines - I build the commercial engine with you: GTM strategy, sales process, first hires, and the operations that hold it together. For early-stage founders (<$200K ARR), I invest my time for equity instead of cash. For scaling founders (>$200K), I bring the same intensity on a retainer."

### 4.2 Key Messages by Audience Segment

#### For ECP Founders (<$200K ARR)

| Message Theme | Key Message | Proof Point |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Validation** | "Your first 10 customers aren't about scaling - they're about learning what actually converts" | CorePlan: Built from first customer to scale in mining vertical |
| **Equity Alignment** | "I invest my time instead of cash because I believe in what you're building" | Operator Capital model with performance acceleration |
| **Practical Focus** | "Forget scalable. Do things that don't scale until you have 30 customers" | Sachee-ism: "Do things that don't scale" |
| **Speed** | "Speed is your weapon. Every day you don't talk to customers is a day lost to incumbents" | Sachee-ism: "Speed is our weapon" |

#### For ICP Founders (>$200K ARR)

| Message Theme | Key Message | Proof Point |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Transition Pain** | "You're stuck because founder-led selling got you here, but it can't scale. You need a system others can run" | Phase model: Transition from engine to engineer to architect |
| **Integrated Approach** | "GTM, hiring, and ops can't be separate projects. They're one system - and they need to be built together" | CorePlan: Built Sales, Marketing, CS, RevOps as integrated function |
| **Team Building** | "Your first sales hire will fail if you don't have playbooks they can follow. Let's build them together" | 20-30 direct reports at peak, "hiring bar raiser" experience |
| **Hard Markets** | "I've sold into mining, construction, and hospitality - markets where every interaction matters and second chances are rare" | CorePlan, Accor Plus, Sidekicker |

### 4.3 Proof Points and Social Proof

#### Quantified Proof Points

| Claim | Evidence | Where to Use |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Built commercial engine at CorePlan | Sales, Marketing, CS, RevOps from first customer to scale | LinkedIn bio, sales calls |
| P&L turnaround at Accor Plus | 71.67% renewal rate (highest in APAC) | Case study, pitch deck |
| Led teams at scale | 20-30 direct reports at peak | Team building conversations |
| First boots on ground operator | UberEATS Perth, Sidekicker WA, Accor Plus, CorePlan | Founder credibility, LinkedIn content |
| Technical background | Engineering degree, 100% programming, built stock system in VB | Technical founder rapport |

#### Story-Based Proof Points

| Story | Core Insight | Best Used For |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| "From Drill Rigs to GTM Frameworks" | Mining taught me to build brutally practical GTM systems | Mining/resources founders, vertical SaaS |
| "Call Centers to COO" | 15 years learning sales the hard way before SaaS | Founder credibility, empathy building |
| "The 135 Clients Story" | (High CTR content) | LinkedIn top of funnel |
| "Desktop Studies, Not Pilots" | De-risk enterprise deals with structured presales | Enterprise sales conversations |

### 4.4 Objection Handling

| Objection | Response Framework |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **"I can't afford advisory right now"** | "That's exactly why I built the Operator Capital model. For founders <$200K ARR, I invest time instead of cash. We align on equity, and you don't pay until you hit milestones." |
| **"I need someone more specialized in [sales/marketing/hiring]"** | "Most startups break at the handoffs between GTM, people, and ops. I build them as one integrated system. Specialists optimize parts; I connect the whole." |
| **"How is this different from a fractional CRO?"** | "A fractional CRO focuses on sales execution. I build the commercial engine - sales, marketing, CS, RevOps, and the team to run it. And I do it at the right altitude for your stage - not enterprise playbooks for early-stage problems." |
| **"I've worked with advisors before and got generic advice"** | "I'm not a coach. I'm an operator who has been first boots on ground at four companies. My frameworks come from building in the trenches, not reading case studies. And I only work with founders in markets I understand - vertical SaaS, complex B2B, under-digitized industries." |
| **"Why equity instead of cash?"** | "Three reasons: (1) Alignment - I only win if you win, (2) Access - you get 18 years of operating experience without cash strain, (3) Conviction - I'm betting my time on founders I believe in." |
| **"I'm not sure I'm ready for this"** | "Let's find out. Book a 30-minute GTM Health Check. I'll tell you honestly whether you're ready - and if you're not, what you need to do first." |

## 5. Content Strategy Overview

### 5.1 Content Pillars

The content strategy is built around **five pillars** - four existing and one new pillar that expands into the "Operator-Advisor" positioning.

| Pillar | Theme | Purpose | ECP/ICP Relevance |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **1. Founder-Led Sales** | "You don't graduate out of sales" | Establish core philosophy | ECP: How to sell, ICP: How to evolve role |
| **2. Practical GTM Systems** | "Stupidly obvious + highly detailed" | Demonstrate expertise | Both: Stage-specific tactics |
| **3. Hard Industries** | "From drill rigs to dashboards" | Differentiate with lived experience | Both: Credibility for vertical/complex B2B |
| **4. First Boots on Ground** | "I didn't advise - I built" | Trust through operator stories | Both: Social proof, relatability |
| **5. People & Team Scaling** (NEW) | "Build the engine AND the team" | Unlock Operator-Advisor positioning | ICP: Hiring, onboarding, performance |

### 5.2 New Content Pillar: People & Team Scaling

This pillar is critical for the repositioning. It unlocks Sachee's underutilized experience in team building and creates differentiation from pure GTM advisors.

**Themes within Pillar 5:**

| Theme | Key Messages | Content Ideas |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| **First Sales Hire** | "Don't hire a VP Sales as your first sales hire" | When to hire, what to look for, how to onboard |
| **Hiring Bar Raiser** | "Your first 5 hires set the culture" | Interview frameworks, red flags, founder involvement |
| **Team Scaling Pain** | "The transition from 5 to 15 people breaks most startups" | Common mistakes, role clarity, founder role evolution |
| **Performance Management** | "What got you here won't get you there" | Early-stage performance systems, feedback loops |
| **Culture Building** | "Culture is what you do, not what you say" | Rituals, values in action, hiring for fit |
| **Onboarding at Scale** | "Your playbooks should enable, not constrain" | First 90 days, ramp time, founder handoff |

### 5.3 Content Themes and Topics

## 8. Brand Strategy

### 8.1 Voice and Tone

**Voice Attributes:**

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct** | Say it plainly, no corporate jargon | "Don't hire a VP Sales as your first sales hire" |
| **Honest** | Share mistakes, not just wins | "I've seen this fail. Here's why." |
| **Practical** | Specific, actionable, usable this week | "Run 10 discovery calls before you touch your website" |
| **Confident** | Opinionated but not arrogant | "I believe X because I've seen it work" |
| **Grounded** | Rooted in real experience, not theory | "At CorePlan, we learned..." |

**Tone Variations:**

| Context | Tone |
|---------|------|
| LinkedIn posts | Conversational, punchy, hook-driven |
| Sales conversations | Consultative, curious, challenging |
| Advisory sessions | Direct, supportive, action-oriented |
| Email nurture | Personal, helpful, low-pressure |

### 8.2 Visual Identity Considerations

**Current State:** Personal brand, minimal visual system

**Recommendations:**

| Element | Recommendation | Priority |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **Headshot** | Professional but approachable, not corporate | High |
| **LinkedIn Banner** | Clear positioning statement, simple design | High |
| **One-pager Design** | Clean, readable, matches website | Medium |
| **Website** | Simple, clear, conversion-focused | Medium |
| **Color Palette** | Neutral, professional, not flashy | Low |
| **Typography** | Readable, modern sans-serif | Low |

**Avoid:**
- Overly polished corporate aesthetic
- Stock photos of handshakes or meetings
- Busy, cluttered design
- Heavy use of gradients or flashy elements

### 8.3 Founder-Led Brand Approach

**Core Principle:** "People buy from people, not logos"

**What This Means:**
- All content comes from Sachee personally (not "Sachee Advisory")
- Personal LinkedIn profile is the primary platform, not a company page
- Stories feature Sachee's experience, not client testimonials (early stage)
- Tone is individual, not institutional

**Brand Architecture:**

```
Sachee Perera (personal brand)
     |
     |-- Advisory Work (engagement model)
     |
     |-- Operator Capital (equity model)
     |
     |-- GTM Strategy Workbook (internal IP)
     |
     |-- Sachee-isms (operating principles)
```

**Public-Facing Assets:**
- LinkedIn profile (primary)
- Personal website (sachee.com.au)
- GTM Phase Check-in (lead magnet)
- One-pager (sales asset)

| Sachee-ism | Marketing Application |
|------------|----------------------|
| **"Speed is our weapon"** | Post consistently, respond to DMs fast, book calls quickly |
| **"Do things that don't scale"** | Personalized DMs, manual follow-ups, 1:1 relationship building |

| **"Stupidly obvious + highly detailed"** | Content that's both simple and specific |
| **"People buy from people"** | Founder-led brand, personal profile over company page |
| **"Lead, don't take orders"** | Challenge assumptions in content and conversations |
| **"When they zig, we zag"** | Contrarian positioning, equity model vs. cash-first |

### Content Prompts for Claude

**Story Post:**
"Here is a rough story from my experience. Turn this into a LinkedIn post for early-stage B2B SaaS founders in AU and NZ. Keep it honest and practical, no hype. Give me three versions with different hooks and end each with a simple CTA to follow or reply."

**GTM Breakdown:**
"Here is a concept from my GTM frameworks. Turn this into a clear LinkedIn post that explains the idea to a founder under 300k ARR. Use simple language and one concrete example. Finish with a question that invites replies."

**Offer Post:**
"Draft a LinkedIn post inviting early-stage B2B SaaS founders in AU/NZ to a GTM Health Check call. Make it clear who it is for, what they get, and what they need to do. Keep it to 200-250 words."
