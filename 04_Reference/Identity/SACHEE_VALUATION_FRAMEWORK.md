# Sachee's Early-Stage B2B SaaS Valuation Framework

**Purpose:** Internal operating system for evaluating early-stage B2B software opportunities
**Use Cases:**
1. Client advisory (help founders understand their position)
2. Personal investment decisions (angel/advisor equity)
3. VC introductions (package deals with credibility)

**Last Updated:** December 2025
**Version:** 2.2 (AU Market Calibrated + Reality Check + Ownership Sanity Check)

## How This Framework Works

### Framework Philosophy

This framework serves two purposes:

1. **Valuation Calculator** - Produce defensible pre-money range with methodology
2. **Diagnostic Tool** - Help founders see which elements are weak and need work before approaching investors

Per Australian VC research: "The amount of capital sought and valuation did not impact selection at the initial screening stage." **Proof points matter more than the number.**

**Recommendation:** Counsel founders to focus on building evidence for each Berkus element rather than negotiating on valuation. The framework highlights gaps to fix.

### Three Tiers of Assessment

| Tier | Time | Inputs | Output | When to Use |
|------|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Tier 1: Quick Screen** | 30 mins | Pitch deck + 15-min call | Pass/Dig Deeper/Pass to Network | Initial filter |
| **Tier 2: Full Diagnostic** | 2-3 hours | 2 calls + metrics review | Valuation range + VC Intro Memo | Serious consideration |
| **Tier 3: Deep Dive** | 1-2 days | Full diligence + references | Investment thesis + Deal structure | Personal investment |

### Three Outputs

1. **Valuation Range:** Defensible pre-money range with methodology
2. **Sachee Investment Score:** Personal decision framework (Invest / Advise / Introduce / Pass)
3. **VC Introduction Package:** Structured memo that shows you've done the work

## Part 1: Phase Classification

*"The first question is always: What stage are they actually at?"*

### The Fit Ladder

| Phase | ARR Range | Customer Count | Core Question | Primary "Fit" |
|-------|-----------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **1a** | $0-50K | 0-10 | Will anyone pay? | Problem-Solution Fit |
| **1b** | $50-200K | 10-30 | Can we repeat this? | Early Product-Market Fit |
| **2** | $200K-1M | 30-100 | Can others sell it? | Go-to-Market Fit |
| **3** | $1M-10M | 100+ | Can we scale without breaking? | Operational Fit |

### Phase Diagnostic Questions

**To determine actual phase (not what founder claims):**

- How many customers are paying full price? (Not pilots, not discounts, not "design partners")
- How many of those customers look similar? (Same ICP, same use case, same buying motion)
- Could you describe exactly how the last 3 customers found you and bought?
- If the founder got hit by a bus, could someone else close the next deal?

**Red Flags for Misclassified Phase:**
- Claims Phase 1b but can't name 10 similar paying customers
- Claims Phase 2 but founder is still in every sales call
- "Revenue" is mostly pilots, POCs, or heavily discounted deals
- Customers are all different segments with different use cases

### Phase Determines Valuation Method

| Phase | Primary Method | Secondary Method | Revenue Multiple Relevance |
|-------|----------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **1a** | Berkus + Founder Assessment | Scorecard | Irrelevant |
| **1b** | Scorecard + GTM Readiness | Berkus | Directional only |
| **2** | VC Method + Unit Economics | Scorecard | Meaningful (8-15x) |
| **3** | Revenue Multiple + Comparables | VC Method | Primary (5-12x) |

## Part 2: The Founder Engine Assessment

*"You never graduate out of sales. The role evolves: Engine → Engineer → Architect."*

### The Three Roles

| Role | Phase | What It Means | Assessment Focus |
|------|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **Engine** | 1a-1b | Founder IS the sales motion | Can they actually sell? |
| **Engineer** | 2 | Founder designs the system others run | Can they systematize? |
| **Architect** | 3 | Founder oversees the system | Can they let go? |

### Founder Engine Scoring (Phase 1a-1b Focus)

Score each dimension 1-5. Minimum viable = 3.0 average.

**Phase-Specific Weights:**

| Dimension | Phase 1a | Phase 1b | Phase 2+ |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Selling Capability | 20% | 22% | 25% |
| **Founder-Led Sales Execution** | **15%** | **12.5%** | 10% |
| Learning Velocity | 20% | 20% | 20% |
| Problem Clarity | 18% | 18% | 18% |
| Coachability | 15% | 15% | 15% |
| Positioning Instinct | 12% | 12.5% | 12% |

*At Phase 1a, Founder-Led Sales Execution is weighted heavily because the founder IS the sales motion. Delegating prematurely is a critical red flag.*

#### A. Selling Capability (Weight: 20% Phase 1a / 22% Phase 1b)

*This measures the founder's ability to sell effectively when they do engage. Separate from whether they're actually doing the sales work (see Founder-Led Sales Execution).*

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Can't articulate value; loses deals to no decision; heavy discounting |
| 2 | Takes meetings but can't close; relies on product demos over discovery |
| 3 | Can close but inconsistent; doesn't understand why deals win/lose |
| 4 | Runs solid discovery, ties to pain, closes at reasonable prices |
| 5 | Consultative seller, challenges prospects, commands premium pricing |

**Assessment Questions:**
- "Walk me through your last 3 sales conversations. What did you learn?"
- "What's your close rate from first meeting to signed contract?"
- "When did you last push back on a prospect's request?"
- "What's the biggest deal you've closed and how did you do it?"

#### B. Founder-Led Sales Execution (Weight: 15% Phase 1a / 12.5% Phase 1b) — NEW

*This is the most critical Phase 1a dimension. At this stage, the founder IS the sales motion. Delegating to hired salespeople before personally closing 5-10 customers is a major red flag.*

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Avoids sales entirely; hired others to figure it out; not doing the work |
| 2 | Delegates most sales; occasionally joins calls but lets others lead |
| 3 | Does some founder-led sales but inconsistently; splits time with other priorities |
| 4 | Actively doing founder-led sales; faces rejection; iterates on approach |
| 5 | Obsessively doing founder-led sales; knocking on doors; doing whatever it takes |

**Assessment Questions:**
- "How many sales conversations have YOU personally had in the last 30 days?"
- "Tell me about the last time you got rejected. What did you do next?"
- "Who is making the outbound calls / sending the emails / knocking on doors?"
- "Have you hired anyone for sales before proving you can close deals yourself?"

**Red Flags:**
- Technical founder who "doesn't do sales" and hired a Sales Manager
- SDRs or BDRs making cold calls while founder codes
- "We need to hire salespeople to scale" at <$50K ARR
- Can't describe their last 5 personal sales conversations

**Sachee-ism:** *"You never graduate out of sales"* - The founder who tries to hire their way out of sales at Phase 1a will fail.

#### C. Learning Velocity (Weight: 20%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Same pitch for 6+ months, ignores feedback |
| 2 | Acknowledges feedback but doesn't act on it |
| 3 | Iterates occasionally, changes take weeks |
| 4 | Weekly iteration based on customer conversations |
| 5 | Daily learning loops, tests hypotheses systematically |

**Assessment Questions:**
- "What's different about your pitch today vs. 3 months ago? Why?"
- "Tell me about a time customer feedback changed your product roadmap"
- "How do you capture learnings from lost deals?"

**Sachee-ism:** *"Speed is our weapon"* - Early-stage can't out-resource, must out-learn.

#### D. Problem Clarity (Weight: 18%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Can't articulate the problem without product-speak |
| 2 | Describes features, not customer pain |
| 3 | Can describe pain but it's generic ("save time, save money") |
| 4 | Specific, quantified pain with customer quotes |
| 5 | Owns the problem category, customers say "finally someone gets it" |

**Assessment Questions:**
- "Describe your customer's problem without mentioning your product"
- "What's the cost of this problem in dollars or time?"
- "What do customers say in their own words about why they bought?"

**Sachee-ism:** *"Stupidly obvious + highly detailed"* - Simple AND specific wins.

#### E. Coachability (Weight: 15%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Defensive, explains away all feedback |
| 2 | Listens but doesn't implement |
| 3 | Implements some feedback, selective |
| 4 | Actively seeks feedback, implements quickly |
| 5 | Hungry for coaching, admits gaps openly, asks great questions |

**Assessment Questions:**
- Observe: How do they respond to pushback in conversation?
- "What's the hardest feedback you've received and what did you do about it?"
- "What do you know you're not good at?"

#### F. Positioning Instinct (Weight: 12%)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | "We're like Salesforce but better" (me-too) |
| 2 | Competes on features against incumbents |
| 3 | Has a wedge but doesn't articulate it well |
| 4 | Clear differentiation, owns a niche |
| 5 | Contrarian positioning, creates new category |

**Assessment Questions:**
- "Why would a customer choose you over [incumbent]?"
- "Who is your ideal customer and who is NOT your customer?"
- "What do you believe that your competitors don't?"

**Sachee-ism:** *"When they zig, we zag"* - Contrarian wins, head-to-head loses.

### Founder Engine Score Calculation

**Phase 1a Calculation:**
```
Founder Engine Score =
  (Selling × 0.20) +
  (Founder-Led Execution × 0.15) +
  (Learning × 0.20) +
  (Problem Clarity × 0.18) +
  (Coachability × 0.15) +
  (Positioning × 0.12)
```

**Phase 1b Calculation:**
```
Founder Engine Score =
  (Selling × 0.22) +
  (Founder-Led Execution × 0.125) +
  (Learning × 0.20) +
  (Problem Clarity × 0.18) +
  (Coachability × 0.15) +
  (Positioning × 0.125)
```

| Score | Interpretation | Investment Implication |
|-------|----------------|------------------------|
| 4.0+ | Exceptional founder | Strong invest signal |
| 3.5-4.0 | Solid founder | Investable with right terms |
| 3.0-3.5 | Developing founder | Advisory relationship first |
| 2.5-3.0 | Significant gaps | Pass or coach-only |
| <2.5 | Not ready | Pass |

**Critical Note:** A founder with high Selling Capability (4-5) but low Founder-Led Execution (1-2) is a red flag. They may have the skills but aren't doing the work. At Phase 1a, both dimensions must be strong.

## Part 3: Valuation Methodology by Phase

### Phase 1a Valuation ($0-50K ARR)

*Revenue multiples are meaningless. This is a story-based valuation.*

#### Method 1: Berkus Method (Calibrated for AU 2025)

*Australian pre-seed median hit $1M (record high) and seed median reached $3M in 2024, with valuations up 11-12% from 2023. The original US Berkus values are too conservative for the current AU market.*

| Element | Max Value (AUD) | Assessment | Sector Adjustment |
|---------|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Sound Idea** | $800K | Is this a real problem worth solving? Evidence of pain? Market timing right? | AI-first: +$200K-$400K (criteria-based) |
| **Working Product** | $800K | Does the product work? Reduces technology risk? Customers using it? | Hardware/IoT: +$100K |
| **Quality Founder** | $800K | Founder Engine Score × $160K | Female-led: +$100K |
| **Strategic Relationships** | $800K | Customers, advisors, partnerships, industry connections that de-risk | Industrial B2B: +$200K |
| **Early Revenue** | $800K | Paying customers? Revenue quality? Retention signals? | — |
| **TOTAL** | **$4M** | | |

**Sector-Specific Adjustments:**
- **AI-first products:** +$200K-$400K to Sound Idea (criteria-gated — see below)

**AI Premium Qualifying Criteria (must meet at least 2):**
| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Proprietary Data | Privileged/proprietary data that competitors can't easily replicate |
| Model Performance | Demonstrable model performance beyond off-the-shelf APIs (not just a ChatGPT wrapper) |
| Workflow Lock-in | Switching costs once embedded in customer workflow |

*If just using off-the-shelf AI (ChatGPT wrapper, standard API calls): No premium applies.*

- **Industrial B2B (mining, construction, manufacturing):** +$200K to Strategic Relationships (enterprise relationships harder to build)
- **Female-led teams:** +$100K to Quality Founder (explicit AU investor preference per research)
- **Hardware/robotics/IoT:** +$100K to Working Product (non-software led 2024 funding)
- **Climate tech:** +$50K to Sound Idea (resilient sector)

**Investor Signal Bonuses:**
- Previous funding (grants, accelerators, F&F): +$50-100K to Strategic Relationships
- Bootstrapped to revenue: +$100K to Early Revenue

**Phase 1a Berkus Range:** $1.0M - $3.5M pre-money

#### Method 2: Scorecard Method (Calibrated for AU 2025)

Start with AU pre-seed median: **$3.0M** (record high in 2024)

| Factor | Weight | Score Range | Max Adjustment |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Founder/Team | 30% | 0.5-1.5 | ±15% |
| Market Size & Timing | 20% | 0.5-1.5 | ±10% |
| Product/Tech | 15% | 0.5-1.5 | ±7.5% |
| Competition | 10% | 0.5-1.5 | ±5% |
| Sales/Channels | 10% | 0.5-1.5 | ±5% |
| Traction Quality | 10% | 0.5-1.5 | ±5% |
| Investor Signals | 5% | 0.5-1.5 | ±2.5% |

**Score Guide:**
- 0.5 = Major weakness
- 0.75 = Below average
- 1.0 = Average
- 1.25 = Above average
- 1.5 = Exceptional strength

**Investor Signals Factor:**
- Previous funding (grants, accelerators, F&F): 1.25
- Revenue or working product: 1.25
- Female-led: 1.25-1.5 (explicit AU investor preference)
- All three present: 1.5

#### Method 3: Phase 1a Valuation Modifiers

*These modifiers adjust the base valuation based on founder behaviors and market fit. Apply after Berkus/Scorecard triangulation.*

**A. Founder-Led Sales Execution Modifier**

| Founder-Led Execution Score | Modifier |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| 5 (Obsessively doing sales) | **+15%** |
| 4 (Actively doing sales) | **+10%** |
| 3 (Doing some sales) | 0% |
| 2 (Delegating most sales) | **-15%** |
| 1 (Avoiding sales / hired prematurely) | **-25%** |

**B. Market/Cultural Fit Modifier (Phase 1a-1b only)**

> **⚠️ WHEN TO USE THIS SECTION:**
> - **Use Section B** for companies WITH some traction (paying customers OR revenue > $0)
> - **Use Section E3 instead** for ZERO-TRACTION deals (ARR = $0 AND Customers = 0)
> - **NEVER apply both** Section B and Section E3 to the same deal
>
> Section B applies variable penalties based on industry fit and sales complexity.
> Section E3 applies enhanced penalties specifically for zero-traction deals.

*For B2B sales to local SMBs, cultural alignment and domain expertise significantly impact sales effectiveness. Penalties vary by sales complexity - harder sales get bigger penalties.*

| Factor | Modifier |
|--------|----------|
| Founder is from the country they're selling in | 0% (baseline) |
| Founder is NOT from the country | **-7%** |
| Founder has relevant industry background | **+5%** |
| Founder has NO industry background | **See Variable Penalty by Sales Complexity below** |
| Evidence of trust barriers (accent, cultural, remote) | **-3.5%** |

**Variable Penalty by Sales Complexity (if NO industry background):**

| Sale Type | Base Penalty | Examples | Why It Matters |
|-----------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| **High-touch enterprise** | **-20% to -25%** | Mining, construction, healthcare, government | Long cycles, multiple stakeholders, deep domain expertise required |
| **SMB direct sales** | **-15% to -20%** | Tradies, restaurants, small hospitality | Cultural trust critical, industry language matters |
| **Horizontal SaaS to tech-native buyers** | **-10% to -15%** | Dev tools, marketing tech, design tools | Less domain-specific, buyers more willing to try new solutions |

**Maximum Cumulative Penalty** (country + industry + trust barriers): **-35% to -40%** for high-touch enterprise with full barriers

**C. Premature Scaling Penalty**

*If the company has hired or spent before founder-led sales is validated, apply penalties.*

| Symptom | Penalty |
|---------|---------|
| Hired sales team before founder closed 5+ deals personally | **-20%** |
| Hired SDRs/BDRs before ICP was validated | **-15%** |
| Ran significant paid ads before positioning was clear | **-10%** |
| Has organizational overhead (5+ people) with <$50K ARR | **-10%** |
| **Maximum Cumulative Penalty** | **-50%** |

**D. Grit/Tenacity Premium**

*Reward founders who are doing the hard work personally.*

| Behavior | Premium |
|----------|---------|
| Evidence of manual, high-touch founder-led sales (door-to-door, cold calling) | **+10%** |
| Evidence of facing rejection and iterating rapidly | **+5%** |
| Extreme capital efficiency (near break-even on minimal funding) | **+10%** |
| Bootstrapped to $50K+ ARR | **+10%** |
| **Maximum Cumulative Premium** | **+25%** |

**Sachee-ism:** *"Do things that don't scale"* - At Phase 1a, manual high-touch founder-led sales is the only way to learn. Premature scaling delays learning and burns cash.

#### Phase 1a Triangulation

Run both methods, apply modifiers, take the overlap:
1. Calculate Berkus value (+ sector adjustments)
2. Calculate Scorecard value
3. Apply Phase 1a Modifiers (A, B, C, D)
4. **Apply Reality Check (Section E below) — MANDATORY**
5. Triangulate to range

**Phase 1a Valuation = Range where methods converge after modifiers AND reality check**

Typical Phase 1a range: **$1.5M - $3.5M pre-money** *(but see Reality Check for zero-traction deals)*

---

#### E. Reality Check — MANDATORY (v2.1)

*The Berkus and Scorecard methods give credit for "potential" — but potential without proof is worth very little in the AU market. These reality checks ensure valuations reflect what investors will actually pay.*

**Why This Matters:**
- An "idea" with no customers isn't worth $1M+ regardless of what the math says
- AU pre-seed investors want to see *something* before writing checks
- Zero-traction valuations are essentially negotiated prices, not intrinsic value

##### E1. Zero-Traction Discount (MANDATORY if ARR=0 AND Customers=0)

| Condition | Discount | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| ARR = $0 AND Paying Customers = 0 | **-50% to -60%** | No validation that anyone will pay |
| ARR = $0 AND Paying Customers = 0 AND No working product | **-60% to -70%** | Idea stage only |
| Has pilot/POC customers but no paying customers | **-30% to -40%** | Soft validation, not revenue |

**Application:**
```
IF (ARR = $0) AND (Paying Customers = 0):
    Final Range = Triangulated Range × (0.40 to 0.50)

IF (ARR = $0) AND (Paying Customers = 0) AND (No Product in Market):
    Final Range = Triangulated Range × (0.30 to 0.40)
```

##### E2. Idea-Stage Valuation Cap

| Stage Evidence | Maximum Valuation | Who Invests Here |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Idea only (no product) | **$300K - $500K** | Friends & family, grants |
| MVP but no users | **$400K - $600K** | Accelerators, angels |
| MVP with some users but no revenue | **$500K - $800K** | Pre-seed angels |
| First paying customer(s) | **$800K - $1.5M** | Pre-seed funds |

**Hard Cap Rule:**
```
IF (No product in market) OR (Product but zero users):
    Cap valuation at $500K - $750K regardless of method outputs
```

##### E3. Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty (ZERO-TRACTION DEALS ONLY)

> **⚠️ WHEN TO USE THIS SECTION:**
> - **Use Section E3** for ZERO-TRACTION deals ONLY (ARR = $0 AND Customers = 0)
> - **Use Section B instead** for companies with some traction (paying customers OR revenue > $0)
> - **NEVER apply both** Section B and Section E3 to the same deal

*The original -7% for "not from industry" is too generous. Selling B2B to an industry you don't understand is a major risk. For zero-traction deals, penalties increase based on sales complexity.*

**Base Penalties by Country/Industry Fit:**

| Condition | Base Penalty | Additional Variable Penalty |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------------|
| Founder from country AND from industry | **0%** | None (baseline advantage) |
| Founder from industry but NOT from country | **-10%** | None (has credibility, cultural gap) |
| Founder NOT from industry | **See Sales Complexity Table below** | Varies by sale type |
| Founder NOT from country AND NOT from industry | **See Sales Complexity Table below** | +5% additional penalty (double trust barrier) |

**Variable Penalty by Sales Complexity (if NOT from industry):**

| Sale Type | Base Penalty | Examples | Why It Matters |
|-----------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| **High-touch enterprise** | **-20% to -25%** | Mining, construction, healthcare, government | Long cycles, multiple stakeholders, deep domain expertise required |
| **SMB direct sales** | **-15% to -20%** | Tradies, restaurants, small hospitality | Cultural trust critical, industry language matters |
| **Horizontal SaaS to tech-native buyers** | **-10% to -15%** | Dev tools, marketing tech, design tools | Less domain-specific, buyers more willing to try new solutions |

**Maximum Cumulative Penalty** (not from country + not from industry + high-touch enterprise): **-30% to -35%**

**Replaces** the original Market/Cultural Fit Modifier (Section B) for zero-traction deals.

##### E4. Reality Check Decision Tree

```
START
│
├── Does the company have paying customers?
│   │
│   ├── YES → Proceed with standard valuation methods
│   │
│   └── NO → Apply Zero-Traction Discount (E1)
│       │
│       ├── Do they have a working product with users?
│       │   │
│       │   ├── YES → Apply -50% discount, cap at $800K
│       │   │
│       │   └── NO → Apply -60-70% discount, cap at $500K
│       │
│       └── Is founder from the industry they're selling to?
│           │
│           ├── YES → Reduce discount by 10%
│           │
│           └── NO → Apply Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty (E3)
│
END
```

##### E5. Reality-Calibrated Ranges by Stage

| Actual Stage | Zero-Traction Reality | Some Traction Reality | Strong Traction |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Idea only** | $200K - $500K | N/A | N/A |
| **MVP, no users** | $300K - $600K | N/A | N/A |
| **MVP, users, no revenue** | $400K - $800K | N/A | N/A |
| **First paying customers (1-3)** | N/A | $600K - $1.2M | N/A |
| **Phase 1a ($0-50K ARR)** | N/A | $1.0M - $2.0M | $1.5M - $3.0M |
| **Phase 1b ($50-200K ARR)** | N/A | N/A | $2.0M - $4.0M |

**Key Insight:** The original framework's "Typical Phase 1a range: $1.5M - $3.5M" assumes SOME traction. Zero-traction deals should never approach $1.5M unless the founder is exceptional (serial entrepreneur, deep domain expert, proprietary tech).

##### E6. When to Override Reality Check

The Reality Check can be relaxed (not eliminated) if:

| Override Condition | Adjustment |
|--------------------|------------|
| Serial entrepreneur with successful exit | Reduce discount by 20% |
| Deep domain expert (10+ years in industry) | Reduce discount by 15% |
| Proprietary technology with IP protection | Reduce discount by 10% |
| Strong existing investor commitments | Reduce discount by 10% |
| **Maximum override** | **50% of original discount** |

**Example:**
- Zero-traction company gets -60% discount
- Founder is serial entrepreneur (+20% reduction) with domain expertise (+15% reduction)
- Adjusted discount: -60% + 35% reduction = -60% × 0.65 = **-39% final discount**

##### F. Ownership Sanity Check — NEW (v2.2)

*This is a "bounding box" check — not a valuation method, but a reality test that compares framework output against what the market expects based on round size and dilution.*

**The Core Formula:**
```
Implied Pre-Money = (Round Size ÷ Target Dilution) - Round Size
```

**AU/NZ 2024-25 Market Norms:**

| Round Type | Typical Raise | Typical Dilution | Implied Pre-Money Range |
|------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Pre-seed (angel-only) | $250K-$750K | 5%-12% | $1.8M - $14.75M |
| Pre-seed (with lead) | $750K-$2M | 10%-20% | $3.0M - $18M |
| Seed | $2M-$6M | 15%-25% | $6M - $34M |

**Worked Example:**

Founder wants to raise $500K. What does the market expect?
- At 10% dilution: $500K ÷ 0.10 - $500K = **$4.5M pre-money**
- At 15% dilution: $500K ÷ 0.15 - $500K = **$2.83M pre-money**
- At 20% dilution: $500K ÷ 0.20 - $500K = **$2.0M pre-money**

So the market expects a $500K raise to imply a **$2.0M-$4.5M pre-money** valuation.

**How to Apply:**

| Scenario | Status | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Framework range overlaps with implied pre-money | **Aligned** | Proceed with confidence |
| Framework range is 50%+ below implied | **Gap** | Founder expectations high OR raise too large |
| Framework range is 50%+ above implied | **Overvalued** | Founder undervaluing OR raise too small |

**Assessment Template:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Founder's Stated Raise** | $______ |
| **Expected Dilution Range** | ___% - ___% |
| **Implied Pre-Money (low)** | $______ |
| **Implied Pre-Money (mid)** | $______ |
| **Implied Pre-Money (high)** | $______ |
| **Framework Valuation Range** | $______ - $______ |
| **Alignment Status** | [Aligned / Gap / Overvalued] |

**Notes:**

---

**Sachee-ism:** *"An idea without proof is a wish, not a business."* - The Reality Check ensures we value what IS, not what COULD BE.

---

### Phase 1b Valuation ($50K-200K ARR)

*Traction signals start to matter, but repeatability is the key question.*

#### Primary: Traction-Weighted Scorecard

Same scorecard as 1a, but add:

| Factor | Weight | Assessment |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Traction Quality** | +15% weight | Pattern in customers? Similar ICP? |
| **GTM Repeatability** | +10% weight | Can they describe how to get the next 10? |

Reduce "Market Size" weight by 10%, "Other" by 15%.

#### Secondary: Early Revenue Multiple (Directional Only)

| ARR | Typical Multiple Range | Implied Valuation |
|-----|------------------------|-------------------|
| $50K | 20-40x | $1M - $2M |
| $100K | 15-30x | $1.5M - $3M |
| $200K | 12-25x | $2.4M - $5M |

**But discount heavily for:**
- Concentrated revenue (top customer >30%)
- High churn (>10% monthly)
- Low NPS or unclear retention
- Random wins vs. pattern

#### Phase 1b GTM Readiness Modifier

| GTM Readiness Score | Valuation Modifier |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| 0-25 (Chaos) | -20% |
| 25-50 (Emerging) | 0% |
| 50-75 (Investable) | +15% |
| 75-100 (Scale-ready) | +30% |

**Phase 1b Valuation Range:** $1.5M - $4M pre-money

---

### Phase 2+ Valuation ($200K+ ARR)

*Unit economics and VC method become primary.*

#### Primary: VC Method

```
Required Exit = (Investment × Target Return) ÷ Expected Ownership at Exit

Pre-Money = (Investment ÷ Target Ownership) - Investment
```

**Typical AU Seed Parameters:**
- Investment: $500K - $2M
- Target Return: 10-20x
- Expected Dilution (future rounds): 30-50%
- Target Exit: $50M - $200M

#### Secondary: Revenue Multiple with Unit Economics Modifier

| Metric | Benchmark | Modifier |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| LTV/CAC | >3x | +1-2x multiple |
| Net Revenue Retention | >100% | +1-2x multiple |
| CAC Payback | <18 months | +1x multiple |
| Burn Multiple | <1.5 | +1x multiple |

**Base Multiple:** 8-12x ARR
**Modified Range:** 6-18x ARR depending on efficiency

**Phase 2 Valuation Range:** $3M - $10M pre-money

## Part 4: GTM Readiness Score

*"The most common pattern: great product, weak GTM. Fix GTM, valuation jumps."*

### GTM Readiness Assessment

Score each 1-10:

| Component | Weight | What to Assess |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **ICP Clarity** | 15% | Can they describe ideal customer in detail? |
| **Sales Process Documentation** | 15% | Written playbook or in founder's head? |
| **Pipeline Predictability** | 15% | Do they know what's coming? |
| **CAC Clarity** | 10% | Do they know cost to acquire? |
| **Conversion Rates** | 10% | What % of demos convert? |
| **Repeatable Channel** | 15% | Is there ONE channel that works? |
| **Win/Loss Analysis** | 10% | Do they know why they win/lose? |
| **Competitive Positioning** | 10% | Clear wedge vs. incumbents? |

### GTM Readiness Score Interpretation

| Score | Stage | Implication |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0-25 | **Chaos** | Founder doing everything ad hoc; no system |
| 25-50 | **Emerging** | Some patterns forming; not documented |
| 50-75 | **Investable** | Repeatable motion; can train someone |
| 75-100 | **Scale-ready** | System runs; ready for sales hire |

### GTM Readiness → Valuation Impact

| Score | Typical Berkus "Sales" Factor | Scorecard "Sales/Channels" |
|-------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 0-25 | $100K (25% of max) | 0.6 |
| 25-50 | $200K (50% of max) | 0.85 |
| 50-75 | $300K (75% of max) | 1.1 |
| 75-100 | $400K (100% of max) | 1.4 |

## Part 5: The Investment Decision Framework

*Three separate decisions: Advise? Invest? Introduce to VCs?*

### Decision 1: Should I Advise This Founder?

| Criteria | Threshold | Weight |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Founder Engine Score | ≥3.0 | Must-have |
| Coachability Score | ≥4 | Must-have |
| Phase | 1a-2 | Preference |
| Industry | B2B SaaS, vertical, complex | Preference |
| Equity/Fee | Meaningful (1-5% or retainer) | Must-have |

**Decision Rule:**
- If both must-haves met AND ≥1 preference → **Advisory fit**
- If Founder Engine <3.0 but Coachability is 5 → **Consider coaching-only**

### Decision 2: Should I Invest My Own Capital?

| Criteria | Threshold | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Founder Engine Score | ≥3.5 | Higher bar for capital |
| Problem Clarity | ≥4 | Must understand the pain |
| Market Timing | "Small but growing NOW" | Not too early, not too late |
| Valuation | ≤$3M pre-money | Entry price matters |
| My Check Size | $10K-$50K | Meaningful to me, helpful to them |
| Ownership Target | 0.5-2% | Enough to matter at exit |

**Personal Investment Checklist:**
- [ ] Would I be embarrassed if this failed? (If yes, pass)
- [ ] Do I want to help this founder beyond money? (If no, pass)
- [ ] Is there a path to $50M+ exit? (If no, pass)
- [ ] Can I add real value (intros, advice, pattern matching)? (If no, pass)

**Sachee-ism Applied:** *"We can do until someone shows us can't"* - Bias toward yes if checklist passes.

### Decision 3: Should I Introduce to VCs?

| Criteria | Threshold | Why It Matters |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Phase | 1b+ with clear traction | VCs want to see pattern |
| Founder Engine | ≥3.5 | VCs invest in founders |
| GTM Readiness | ≥40 | VCs want to see repeatability |
| Valuation Alignment | Founder expectations ≤1.5x my estimate | Avoid wasting VC time |
| Story Quality | Can articulate in 2 mins | VCs are time-poor |

**VC Introduction Readiness Score:**

| Score | Interpretation | Action |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| 5/5 criteria met | **Ready** | Make warm intro with memo |
| 4/5 criteria met | **Almost ready** | Coach on gap, then intro |
| 3/5 criteria met | **Not yet** | Advisory engagement first |
| <3/5 criteria met | **Too early** | Check back in 6 months |

## Part 8: Valuation Benchmarks (AU/NZ B2B SaaS - 2025)

*Updated for 2025 based on record deal sizes: AU pre-seed median $1M, seed median $3M (both record highs in 2024). Valuations up 11-12% from 2023.*

### Pre-Seed / Seed Ranges by Phase

| Phase | Typical Range | Median | Notes |

**Capital Efficiency Bonus:**
- Burn Multiple <1.0 → +10-20% to valuation
- Profitable or near-profitable → +20-30% to valuation

---

## Part 9: Common Patterns & Warnings

### Pattern 1: "Great Product, Weak GTM"

**Symptoms:**
- Founder talks features, not customer pain
- "If we just had more leads..."
- Demo-heavy sales process, light on discovery
- Customers love it, but pipeline is empty

**Valuation Impact:** -20-30% from potential
**Fix:** 90-day GTM sprint (document process, test channels, run experiments)

### Pattern 2: "Random Wins, No Pattern"

**Symptoms:**
- Each customer looks different
- "Our ICP is anyone who needs [category]"
- Can't describe the last 3 deals consistently
- Revenue from unrelated segments

**Valuation Impact:** Stuck at Phase 1a valuation despite revenue
**Fix:** Pick a beachhead, say no to non-ICP deals

**Sachee-ism:** *"Save the cheerleader, save the world"* - Win one segment completely.

### Pattern 3: "Founder Can't Sell"

**Symptoms:**
- All deals come from inbound or referrals
- Avoids outbound conversations
- Heavy discounting to close
- "Sales isn't my strength, I'm technical"

**Valuation Impact:** -30-40% (founders who can't sell can't scale)
**Fix:** Coaching, practice, ride-alongs with a seller

**Sachee-ism:** *"You never graduate out of sales"*

### Pattern 4: "Valuation Expectations Misaligned"

**Symptoms:**
- Comparing to 2021 valuations
- "My friend raised at 50x ARR"
- Unwilling to discuss dilution
- Offended by realistic range

**Valuation Impact:** Deal won't happen; founders will shop for higher number
**Action:** Have the honest conversation; if they won't listen, pass

### Pattern 5: "Too Early for VCs"

**Symptoms:**
- <$50K ARR
- 0-2 customers
- Still pivoting
- No repeatable anything

**Valuation Impact:** N/A for VC
**Action:** Angel or advisory only; check back at Phase 1b

### Pattern 6: "Premature Scaling" — NEW

**Symptoms:**
- Hired sales team before founder closed 5+ deals personally
- SDRs/BDRs making cold calls while founder codes
- Multiple employees (5+) but <$50K ARR
- Significant paid ads spend before positioning was validated
- "We need to hire salespeople to scale" at Phase 1a
- Founder is "too busy" for sales but not too busy to fundraise

**Valuation Impact:** -25% to -50% (cash burn without learning)
**Red Flag Severity:** CRITICAL at Phase 1a

**Why It Matters:**
At Phase 1a, the founder IS the sales motion. Hiring others to figure out sales means:
- Delayed learning loops (founder isn't hearing objections directly)
- Higher burn without validated ICP
- False confidence from hired team activity
- Harder to pivot when the hired team has momentum

**Diagnostic Questions:**
- "Who made your last 5 sales calls?"
- "How many deals have YOU personally closed?"
- "Why did you hire [sales role] before proving you could close deals?"

**Fix:** Founder takes back personal ownership of sales. Consider layoffs to reduce burn. Prove founder-led sales for 90 days before any sales hires.

**Sachee-ism:** *"Do things that don't scale"* - For first 10 customers, founder-led sales is the ONLY way. Premature scaling is the opposite - trying to scale before learning.

- [ ] Calibrate scoring (am I too harsh/lenient?)
- [ ] Update market benchmarks
- [ ] Refine templates based on VC feedback

### Annually

- [ ] Full framework review
- [ ] Update AU market data
- [ ] Add new patterns observed
- [ ] Refresh VC relationship context

## Appendix A: Sachee-isms as Valuation Principles

| Sachee-ism | Valuation Principle |
|------------|---------------------|
| *"Speed is our weapon"* | Value learning velocity over perfection |
| *"Save the cheerleader, save the world"* | Beachhead dominance > broad TAM |
| *"When they zig, we zag"* | Contrarian positioning deserves premium |
| *"Do things that don't scale"* | Phase 1a shouldn't be judged on scalability |
| *"Stupidly obvious + highly detailed"* | Problem clarity indicates founder quality |
| *"You never graduate out of sales"* | Founder selling ability is permanent asset |
| *"Meet them where they're at"* | Product-market fit requires customer context |
| *"One bite at a time"* | Milestone-based valuation, not hockey stick assumptions |

## Appendix B: VC Network Context

*When introducing, know what each VC wants:*

| VC | Stage Focus | Sector Preference | Typical Check | Notes |
|----|-------------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| [Add your VCs] | | | | |
