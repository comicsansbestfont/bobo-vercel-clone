# Sachee Identity: Content & Proof Index

**Purpose:** Central index of key content, appearances, and internal assets that can be used as proof points in GTM strategy work and content creation.

This file does not try to list *everything*. It highlights the pieces that best represent Sachee’s body of work and public presence.

---

## 1. LinkedIn Content

### 1.1 Data Sources

LinkedIn posts are backed up in:
- `04_Reference/linkedin_posts.csv`  
- `04_Reference/linkedin_posts_backup.csv`

Notes:
- `linkedin_posts.csv` is the **primary, current export** with the most complete set of posts.  
- `linkedin_posts_backup.csv` is an **older/partial snapshot** kept purely as a safety backup.  

Use `linkedin_posts.csv` as the default source when mining for themes, quotes, and examples.

### 1.2 Canonical Themes

When referencing “what Sachee talks about on LinkedIn”, lean on these themes:
- Founder-led sales (especially in vertical SaaS and complex B2B).  
- GTM phases from 0–10M ARR (with emphasis on 0–300K ARR).  
- Lessons from mining and heavy-industry GTM.  
- SPICED, discovery, and consultative sales.  
- Positioning, ECP vs ICP, and picking a beachhead.  
- “Sachee-isms”: speed, doing things that don’t scale, lovable GTM, etc.
- Personal reflections and life updates (burnout, cost of building, moving countries, travel and mindset).  
- Vibe Coding and “building in public” on side projects (for fun / experimentation, not primarily for client acquisition).

### 1.3 Featured Posts (to be curated)

This is a **curated shortlist** of the most representative or frequently referenced LinkedIn posts—used when you want a quick, reusable set of examples without scanning the full CSV.

Add high-signal posts here as you identify them. For each, capture:

| Handle | Date | Hook / Title | Theme | Notes / URL |
|--------|------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| `@TODO` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | `"Speed is our weapon"` post | Speed / founder-led sales | Add LinkedIn URL when available |
| `@TODO` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | `"Save the cheerleader, save the world"` post | Beachhead strategy | Add LinkedIn URL when available |
| `@TODO` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | `[...]` | `[...]` | `[...]` |

> **Maintenance:** As you spot high-performing or representative posts, add them to this table with a short theme label and URL.

## 5. Maintenance Notes

- When you publish a **new article, podcast, or talk**, add it to section 3 with enough context for future you (and AI) to know when to use it.  
- When you notice a piece of content becoming a **canonical reference** (e.g. a LinkedIn post or blog that you mention often), add it to the tables above.  
- When you create major new internal frameworks (e.g. Founder-Led Outbound System, Presales OS), add them under **Internal Proof Assets** so they can be easily discovered.
