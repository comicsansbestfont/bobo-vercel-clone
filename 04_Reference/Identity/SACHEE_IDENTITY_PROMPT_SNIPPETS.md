## 2. Medium Bios

### 2.1 For Podcasts, About Pages, and Longer Intros

> **Medium Bio A (Full Operator Arc):**
> Sachee Perera is an operator who has spent 15 years building commercial engines across wildly different industries—from telco call centres to drill rigs. He started in high-volume Telstra sales, progressed to running a full P&L turnaround for Accor Plus's loyalty programme in Perth, then joined Uber as part of the UberEATS launch team (personally closing 39% of Perth's initial restaurants). He went on to lead Sidekicker's WA expansion as General Manager, consulted on AI/analytics product strategy for Austal Ships in the ferry market, and most recently served as COO at CorePlan, where he built the entire commercial operation—Sales, Marketing, CS, RevOps—from pre–product-market fit to $6M+ ARR. He now helps founder-led B2B SaaS teams (especially in vertical and complex B2B markets) build practical GTM systems.

> **Medium Bio B (Pattern: Launches + Turnarounds):**
> Sachee Perera has made a career of being "first boots on ground" for market launches and turnarounds. At Accor Plus, he took over an underperforming loyalty programme and delivered record-breaking sales across APAC. At UberEATS and Sidekicker, he launched Perth markets from scratch. At Austal Ships, he ran customer discovery for AI-powered ferry analytics. At CorePlan, he joined pre–product-market fit and built the GTM engine that took them from 11 to 106+ customers. Across 15 years and five industries—telco, hospitality, marketplaces, shipping, and mining tech—the pattern has been the same: build commercial engines where none exist. He now advises early-stage B2B SaaS founders on GTM.

> **Medium Bio C (For Non-SaaS / General Audience):**
> Sachee Perera is a General Manager and Chief Operating Officer with 15 years of experience building businesses in industries ranging from hospitality to mining technology. He's launched markets for Uber and Sidekicker, turned around underperforming teams at Accor Plus, advised on product strategy for Austal Ships, and built the commercial operation at CorePlan from the ground up. His background spans telco, hospitality, gig economy, maritime, and mining SaaS—always in hands-on operating roles focused on building teams, systems, and revenue.
