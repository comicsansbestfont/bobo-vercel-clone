# Strategic Positioning Document

# **Layer 1 – Company Level (3-Year North Star)**

## **One Sentence Unique Value Proposition**

<aside>
⭐

Swift Check-in protects your project margins by giving you real-time control over all your on-site labor costs, from employee overtime to subcontractor invoices, in one place. Swift check-in is **the central source of truth for Labour Cost Management.**

</aside>

## **Product Vision**

<aside>
🤩

**Be the universal “proof-of-work” layer for industrial construction and trade services—connecting every worker, subcontractor, and payroll system to a single source of indisputable time, cost, and compliance truth.**

</aside>

*Within three years Swift Check-In will replace paper, spreadsheets and generic timesheets with an intelligent, job-aware platform that:*

1. **Detects profit leaks in real time** (overtime, idle time, over-billing).
2. **Auto-reconciles labour costs** to payroll, job cost codes, and subcontractor invoices.
3. **Locks in compliance** by blocking un-inducted or unlicensed personnel at check-in.

## **Positioning Statement**

```c
*For* **mid-sized project-based contractors** (electrical, plumbing, fit-out) *who* struggle with uncontrolled labour costs and unverifiable subcontractor invoices, **Swift Check-In** is an **industrial B2B SaaS platform** that **delivers real-time, job-specific proof of work**.

Unlike **generic field service software or basic timesheet apps**, Swift Check-in uniquely **stops profit leakage from both internal employee overtime and external subcontractor billing on a single, integrated platform**.
```

## **Marketing Core Messaging Pillars**

This is the foundation for all website copy, sales scripts, and content. Every piece of communication should be built on one or more of these pillars:

1. **Eliminate Hidden Profit Leakage:** We find the money you're losing. We talk directly to the financial pain of uncontrolled overtime, fraudulent timesheets, ‘ghost employees'‘, and inaccurate subcontractor invoices. This is about protecting the bottom line on fixed-price projects.
2. **Gain Real-Time Control & Visibility:** We give you the power to act *before* it's too late. We focus on exception-based alerts, live budget vs. actuals, and knowing exactly who is on-site and what they are costing you right now.
3. **Simplify for Your Blended Workforce:** We are built for how you *actually* work. We highlight the unique ability to manage both employees and third-party subcontractors seamlessly, with flexible, project-based pricing that avoids the per-user friction of competitors.

# **Layer 2 – The 90-Day Mission (Outbound Sales Focused)**

## **One-Sentence Unique Value Proposition**

<aside>
🔑

**Swift Check-in stops unbudgeted overtime, alerting you *before* a single hour can destroy your project's profit.**

</aside>

### **90-Day Positioning Statement**

```c
*For* **11-50 person electrical contractors in Australia** *who* see project profits destroyed by surprise overtime, **Swift Check-In** is a **specialized cost-control platform** that provides real-time alerts *before* labor costs go over budget.

Unlike all-in-one job management software (like Fergus or Deputy) which only shows you costs *after the fact*, we act as an **early warning system for your profitability**, ensuring the hours you quoted are the hours you pay for.
```

## **Primary Discovery Questions (Profile A - Overtime Control)**

**Opening Pain Discovery:**

- "How do you currently track when your crew goes into overtime?"
- "What was your biggest overtime surprise last month?"
- "When you find out someone worked 12 hours instead of 8, when do you typically discover that?"

**Quantifying the Pain:**

- "How much overtime did you pay last quarter that wasn't budgeted?"
- "How long does it take you to prepare timesheets for payroll each week?"
- "Have you ever had to have a disciplinary conversation about timesheet accuracy?"

## **Secondary Discovery (Profile B - Intelligence Gathering)**

**When They Mention Subcontractors:**

- "Interesting - do you use many subcontractors?" *(Log response)*
- "How do you currently verify the hours they invoice you for?" *(Log process)*
- "Have you ever had disputes over subcontractor billing?" *(Log frequency/cost)*

**IMPORTANT:** After gathering this intelligence, immediately redirect: *"That's valuable insight for our roadmap. For today, I want to focus on the overtime challenge since that's where we can provide immediate value."*

## **Competitive Sound-Bites**

- **When they say "We use Fergus/ServiceM8":**
    
    "That's perfect. Fergus is great for managing the job, but we're a specialized **profit protection tool** that plugs the #1 hole it doesn't: real-time labor cost control. We don't replace Fergus, we make it more profitable."
    
- **When they say "We use Deputy/Xero Timesheets":**
    
    "Deputy is perfect for a café, but it doesn't understand project budgets. We are built for contractors. We tell you not just if someone is in overtime, but **which project's profit is at risk** because of it."
    
- **When they say "We're looking at Simpro":**
    
    "Simpro is a powerful but complex enterprise tool that focuses on the entire business. We obsess over solving one problem perfectly: stopping overtime overruns at the source, which is the fastest way to add margin back to your bottom line."
    

**ACKNOWLEDGE & REDIRECT** 

- **When Prospects Mention Subcontractor Issues:**
    
    **Step 1: Acknowledge & Log** *"Thank you for sharing that - subcontractor verification is definitely a challenge we're hearing from many contractors. I'm going to make a note of that for our roadmap."* *(Rep logs in CRM: Subcontractor pain mentioned - [specific details])*
    
    **Step 2: Immediate Redirect** *"For today's conversation though, I want to focus exclusively on the overtime issue, as that's where we can provide the most immediate value. Is protecting your project margins from labor overruns the #1 priority for you right now?"*
    
    **Step 3: Disqualify If Necessary** If they insist subcontractors are their main problem: *"Based on that, it sounds like we might not be the perfect fit for you **today**. Our current solution is purpose-built to solve the overtime challenge. Would it be okay if we check back in a few months when our platform has evolved?"*
