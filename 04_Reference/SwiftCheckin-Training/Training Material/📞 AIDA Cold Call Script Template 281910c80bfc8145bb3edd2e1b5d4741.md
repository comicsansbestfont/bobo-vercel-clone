<aside>
⚡

This is your go-to script for every cold call. Customize the bracketed sections based on your pre-call research. The AIDA framework ensures every call has a clear structure that guides the prospect toward booking a demo.

</aside>

**Attention:**

Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from Swift Check-in. I’ll be really quick — The reason for the call is I saw you were [personalisation] and i wanted to talk about overtime costs on your jobs. 

Did I catch you for 30 seconds?

(If yes, continue. If no, ask: *“No worries — when’s a better time later today or tomorrow?”*

**Interest:**

We work with contractors like [Prospect Type — e.g. electrical / plumbing / landscaping] who keep running into the same problem:

- Payroll shocks at the end of the week.
- Crews doing 10–12 hours, but no one knows until it’s too late.
- Subcontractor invoices that don’t quite match the work done.

Most directors tell me it’s not the big jobs that kill margin, it’s those hidden hours that slip through. I’m curious How are you keeping track of that right now?

*[actively listen to the customer and dig in to undersand more about them ]*

*[Examples to draw out]*

- “Roughly how much unbudgeted overtime did you pay last quarter?”
- “How long does it take your office to get timesheets sorted for payroll?”
- “Ever had to push back on a subcontractor invoice because hours didn’t line up?”

[CONFIRM and agree with their problem]

Exactly. The issue is you only find out *after the money’s gone]*

**Desire:**

[Paint a piture into how swift checkin solves the problem]

What Swift Check-in does is stop the leak **before it happens**.

- It gives you complete into your staff or contractor hours
- Geo-fences crew check-ins so you know who’s actually on site.
- And it feeds timesheets straight into MYOB/Xero, cutting out half a day of admin.

That way, the hours you quoted are the hours you pay for.

**Action:**

If I could show you in 15 minutes how other [trade type] contractors are protecting 5–10% of their project margin this way, would you want to see it?

[Pause — let them answer.]

Great. I can walk you through a short demo. How does next [some day at some time]

🚨

The section below shows you the breakdown of each section and the prep work required

</aside>

---

## 1. PRE-CALL RESEARCH (3-5 MINUTES MAX)

<aside>
⏱️

**Time-box this to 5 minutes.** You're looking for ONE strong angle, not writing a biography.

</aside>

**Company Profile:**

- What trade? (Electrical, Roofing, HVAC, Fitout, etc.)
- Company size? (Look for 10-200 employees)
- What services do they offer? (Emergency work? Fixed-price? Subcontractors?)
- Where are they located?

**Key Stakeholders:**

- Owner/Director name
- Operations/Project Manager name
- Office Manager/Admin name

**Quick Hypothesis:**

- What's their likely pain? (Overtime tracking? Payroll chaos? Subcontractor verification?)
- What's their likely awareness stage? (Problem Unaware vs Problem Aware)

---

## 2. WHAT TRIGGERS TO LOOK FOR

### HIGH-VALUE TRIGGERS (Use These First)

**Growth Signals:**

- Hiring new crew/foremen/project managers (LinkedIn, SEEK, Indeed)
- Recently won large contracts (company news, LinkedIn posts)
- Opened new branch/expanded service area (website, Google)

**Operational Signals:**

- Offer 24/7 emergency services (suggests after-hours overtime)
- Fixed-price contracts (suggests tight margins, cost control critical)
- Multiple service lines (suggests complex coordination)
- Heavy use of subcontractors (suggests verification challenges)

**External Events:**

- Recent severe weather in their service area (storms, floods = surge work)
- Regulatory changes (Fair Work compliance pressures)
- Industry busy season approaching (e.g., storm season for roofing)

### MEDIUM-VALUE TRIGGERS (Use If No High-Value)

- Company describes themselves as "family-owned" or "since [year]" (suggests traditional, manual processes)
- Website mentions "100+ projects completed" (suggests high volume)
- Testimonials mention "reliable crews" or "on-time delivery" (suggests they care about operational excellence)

### NO TRIGGER? USE INDUSTRY PATTERN

If you can't find a specific trigger after 5 minutes, use a common industry pain pattern based on their trade.

## 3. HOW TO USE TRIGGERS (3 EXAMPLES)

### EXAMPLE 1: HIRING TRIGGER

**Research Found:**

- Company: BrightSpark Electrical (50 employees)
- LinkedIn post: "Excited to welcome 3 new electricians to the team!"
- Contact: Tom Davidson (Director)

**Trigger → AIDA Angle:**

**ATTENTION:** *"I saw on LinkedIn you're bringing on three new electricians."*

**INTEREST:** *"With that kind of growth, most directors find it becomes critical to ensure overtime doesn't eat into margins before they even see it."*

---

### EXAMPLE 2: SERVICE TYPE TRIGGER

**Research Found:**

- Company: StormShield Roofing (30 employees)
- Website: "24/7 Emergency Roof Repairs - We're There When You Need Us"

# THE COMPLETE AIDA CALL SCRIPT

## A = ATTENTION (Pattern Interrupt + Personalized Hook)

<aside>
🎯

**Goal:** Break through the noise. Prove this isn't spam in 3 seconds.

</aside>

```
Hi [FIRST NAME], this is Kavitha from Swift Check-in.

I know you're likely on-site or between jobs, so I'll be brief.

The reason for the call is I saw [SPECIFIC TRIGGER/OBSERVATION].
```

### ATTENTION FORMULA

**Pattern Interrupt** = "I know you're likely on-site or between jobs, so I'll be brief."

**Personalized Hook** = "I saw [SPECIFIC RESEARCHED FACT ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS]."

### ATTENTION EXAMPLES (Pick One Based On Research)

**Hiring Trigger:**

*"The reason for the call is I saw on LinkedIn you're bringing on three new electricians to the team."*

**Service Type Trigger:**

*"The reason for the call is I saw your company handles 24/7 emergency roof repairs."*

## I = INTEREST (Connect to Their Problem)

<aside>
🔍

**Goal:** Show you understand their world. Connect your research to a relevant pain point. Ask a discovery question.

</aside>

```
I work with a lot of [THEIR TRADE] contractors like [SIMILAR COMPANY NAME IF YOU HAVE ONE] to help manage staff overtime costs.

 I was curious, how do you currently keep track of when your team’s hours start running over budget: [DISCOVERY QUESTION BASED ON TRIGGER]

[PAUSE - WAIT FOR THEIR RESPONSE - DO NOT FILL THE SILENCE]
```

### INTEREST FORMULA

**Credibility Statement** = "I work with a lot of [TRADE] contractors to help manage [SPECIFIC PROBLEM]."

**Discovery Question** = Open-ended question about their current process.

### DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (Pick One Based On Persona/Pain)

**For Owner/Director (Profit/Margin Focus):**

- *"On those [busy/urgent/after-hours] jobs, how do you currently get visibility on crew overtime before it hits payroll?"*
- *"With [TRIGGER], how are you planning to manage labor costs in real-time?"*
- *"What's your current process for spotting when crews are about to hit penalty rates?"*

**For Operations/Project Manager (Coordination Focus):**

- *"With [MULTIPLE PROJECTS/SERVICE LINES], how do you currently track which crews are where and for how long?"*
- *"When a job runs longer than expected, how do you know before it blows out your budget?"*

**For Office Manager/Admin (Payroll Focus):**

- *"How does your team currently collect and verify timesheets from the crew each week?"*
- *"When you run payroll, how often do you find discrepancies or missing hours that need to be chased down?"*

**For Subcontractor Verification:**

- *"When you have subbies on site, how do you currently verify they were actually there and for how long?"*

---

## D = DESIRE (Paint the Promised Land)

<aside>
💎

**Goal:** Create a vivid picture of the positive business outcome. Quantify the value. Use their language back to them.

</aside>

### IF THEY HAVE A SYSTEM (Trust/Excel/Foremen Handle It)

```
That makes sense, and you're not alone in that approach.

What a lot of [TRADE] directors find, though, is that even with the best crews, they're still unintentionally losing 10-15% of project profit to overtime that gets approved on-site without a final check.

Swift Check-in gives you the ability to spot when a crew is about to hit penalty rates in real-time, so you can protect those margins before it hits payroll.
```

### IF THEY DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM (Paper/Chaos/Manual)

```
You're not alone in that—it's actually the most common challenge we hear.

For a busy team like [COMPANY NAME], with [THEIR SITUATION FROM TRIGGER], directors often find that lack of visibility is where 10-15% of a job's profit margin silently disappears.

We help you spot those issues before they become costly by giving you real-time alerts when your crew is about to hit penalty rates. That means you're in control of overtime costs, not just reacting to them later.
```

### IF THEY EXPRESS FRUSTRATION/PAIN

```
That's exactly what I hear from most [TRADE] directors.

What they find after implementing a system like ours is they're saving over $1,000 a month just by eliminating 30 minutes of untracked overtime per crew member, per day.

More importantly, they stop having those "surprise" payroll moments where profit disappears and it's too late to fix it.
```

### DESIRE FORMULA

**Empathy** = "You're not alone / That makes sense / I hear that a lot"

**Third-Party Story** = "What [similar companies] found was..."

**Quantified Outcome** = "10-15% profit protected / $1,000+ saved per month / Real-time control"

---

## A = ACTION (Clear, Low-Friction Next Step)

<aside>
✅

**Goal:** Make it easy to say yes. Offer specific times. Reduce friction.

</aside>

```
Look, I know you're busy and didn't expect my call.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute chat [DAY 1] or [DAY 2] afternoon? 

I'd love to show you how this actually works, and you can see if it's even a fit for your team.

How's [SPECIFIC TIME LIKE 2 PM] on [DAY]?
```

### ACTION FORMULA

**Acknowledge Interruption** = "I know you're busy and didn't expect my call."

**Low-Friction Ask** = "15-minute chat" (not demo, not meeting, not commitment)

**Two Specific Options** = "Tuesday or Thursday" (easier than "when are you free?")

**Permission-Based Close** = "Would you be open to..." (consultative, not pushy)

### ACTION VARIATIONS

**Standard Close:**

*"Would you be open to a quick 15-minute chat next Tuesday or Thursday afternoon? How's 2 PM work?"*

**Alternative Time Close:**

*"I know mornings are chaos. Would Wednesday or Thursday late afternoon work? Say 4 PM?"*

**Next Day Close (If They're Engaged):**

*"Actually, I have a slot tomorrow at 10 AM. Would that work, or is Thursday better?"*

---

# CLOSING THE MEETING (When They Say Yes)

### AIDA FOR CONFIRMATION

**ATTENTION:** Confirm the commitment

**INTEREST:** Set expectations

**DESIRE:** Remind value

**ACTION:** Lock it in with calendar

```
Perfect. I'll send you a calendar invite right now for [DAY] at [TIME].

Just to confirm, this is [THEIR EMAIL]?

In the meantime, I'll send you a quick one-pager so you can see what we're about before we chat.

Looking forward to it, [NAME]. Have a great day.
```
