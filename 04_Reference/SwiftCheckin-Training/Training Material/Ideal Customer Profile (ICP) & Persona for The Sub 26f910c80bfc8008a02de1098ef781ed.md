# Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) & Persona for The "Subcontractor verification"

**Firmographics & Technographics**

| **Attribute** | **Definition** | **Why it Matters for Us** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Industry Vertical** | Interior fit-outs. (Secondary focus: Night work contractors.) | Their work outcome is based on the quality of subcontractor's work, which can be monitored using checkin/checkouts of subbies. |
| **Company Size** | 5+ subcontractor companies.
20+ subcontractors. | Companies dealing with many small subcontracting companies. Enterprise software is too complex for both these companies and their subcontractors. A per-user licensing model fails, since companies have no control over subcontractor workers. |
| **Business Model** | Contracts with subbies | Quality is directly linked to their reputation and winning their next project. Ensuring the hours of a specialised worker as per the contract is crucial for them to ensure the quality and avoid re-work. |
| **Technographics** | Accounting/Payroll: MYOB, Xero. Ops/Job Mgt for internal employees. | They are using something for internal employees. Our position as a "subcontractor verification" tool makes us stand out. Gradually, we can bring their internal employees to our platform if we stand out. |

**The Core Job-to-be-Done (JTBD)**

What is this customer *hiring* Swift Check-in to do?

**"Enable me to ensure subcontractor workmanship quality by providing real-time site data on their work hours along with proof of completed work."**

**Key Personas**

**Primary Persona: "Gina," the Director / CFO (The Economic Champion)**

**Role & Responsibilities:** She is the director and key finance person. She's responsible for everything from winning new project to ensuring they are delivered profitably. She is frequently in disagreement with subcontractors where hours are not matching with the quality of work they provide.

**Goals & Motivators (What they want):**

- **Ensure subcontractors meet the contracted hours:** Her #1 goal. She must verify that each subcontractor works the hours quoted.
- **Reduce Stress:** She wants to avoid future disputes with their subcontractors. Daily/history report provides her with that visibility.
- **Business Growth:** Her future projects are dependent on the quality of the current work they provide.

**Pains & Frustrations (What keeps them up at night):**

- **Subcontractor verification:** This is her primary pain. Subbie invoices are not matching with the hours/quality of the work completed.
- **Lack of Accountability:** She suspects her subcontractors aren't always honest on the hours they worked but lacks the irrefutable proof to challenge them.
- **Profitability:** She knows over-charging by subcontractors are affecting their profitability. When they get the invoice, it is too late.
- **CFO's time:** She knows it is a waste of time on getting into arguments and low-value work instead of more strategic tasks.

**Success Metrics:** Accurately measuring the daily subbies hours and comparing it with the quality and progress of the work; cutting down director's(CFO) time for each subbies invoice processing.

**Secondary Persona: "Glenn," the Site Manager (Middle man between Management & Subbies)**

- **Role:** Manages project on-site with the help of internal employees & subcontractors.
- **Primary Goal:** Good relationship with subcontractors to get the work completed and get their invoices paid on time.
- **Pain:** Middle man, who is responsible for finishing projects on-time and answerable to management about subcontractor over-charging.
- **"In Their Own Words":***"Would be nice if subbies can use this system and send the photos from site. But hard to get it done."*

**Secondary Persona: The Admin staff (The office staff)**

- **Role:** Checks the subbie's compliance documents, licences and do the verification.
- **Primary Goal:** At the moment, they have a WHS system where they enter the license details. But it won't stop subbies from site checkins.
- **Pain:** Finds paperwork, check the expiry dates and call subbies to update the licenses.

**Value Proposition & Messaging**

- **One-Sentence Pitch:** "Swift Check-in verifies the subcontractor hours with their quoted hours to make sure the project profitability and quality is maintained."
- **Positioning Statement:** "For fitout companies subcontractor over-charging kills their profitability, Swift check-in is a specialised cost-control platform that live track subcontractor hours. Unlike a job management platform like Fergus, we act as an **early warning system for your profitability**, ensuring the sub-contractor hours are matching with what they have quoted."
- **ROI Talking Point:** "A 5% reduction in the subcontractor invoices on a $1M project saves you ~$50,000. Our system pays for itself by preventing subcontractor overcharging."

**Competitive & Objection Handling Protocol**

| **When they say...** | **You say...** |
| --- | --- |
| **"We use Fergus/ServiceM8."** | "That's great that you're using ServiceM8 or Fergus. Swift Check-in is built specifically for subcontractor labour hour management. 
 
Most software like Fergus are designed for timesheet based work or small jobs, whereas Swift Check-in is for short-term, mid-term, and longer-term projects" 
 
Our pricing model is more suited for this kind of work and doesn't limit you in terms of the number of users. |
| **"We use Deputy/Xero Timesheets."** | "Deputy is perfect for a café, but it doesn't understand project budgets. We are built for contractors. We tell you not just *if* someone is on-site, but *which project's profit is at risk* because of it." |
| **"What about subcontractor inductions?"** | **Execute the Acknowledge & Redirect Protocol:** 
1. **Acknowledge & Log:** "That's valuable insight. Subcontractor induction management is something we hear from multiple contractors. Let me make a note of it to add to our roadmap". 
2. **Redirect:** "For today's conversation, though, I want to focus exclusively on the subcontractor verification, as that's where we can provide the most immediate value. Is protecting your project margins from subcontractor over-billing the #1 priority for you right now?" |

**Sales Outreach Execution Guidelines**

**Research & Personalisation Cues:** Look for signals on LinkedIn/company websites: "night project works," posts about "new projects awarded," mentions of fixed-price work, company values around "quality and reputation."

**Do's and Don'ts:**

| **DO** | **DO NOT** |
| --- | --- |
| Lead every conversation with the subcontractor hour verification tool. | Do not lead with "we are a check-in/checkout software." |
| Talk relentlessly about quality and avoid re-work. | Do not talk about generic benefits like "efficiency." |
| Keep the demo laser-focused on the subcontractor hours and reports | Do not give a "grand tour" of the platform. |
| Use their words back to them (e.g., "site-hour reporting"). | Do not use corporate jargon. |
| End every call with a concrete next step. | Do not end with a passive "let us know." |

**Use Case Deep Dive: Overtime & Overrun Control**

**Purpose of this Document:** This document moves beyond *who* our customer is and dives deep into the *what* and *why* of their core problem.

Its goal is to provide an intimate understanding of the broken workflow we are fixing, so our team can speak with the confidence of an expert who has seen and solved this exact issue countless times.

**1. The Situation: A Day in the Life of the Subcontractor hour verification Problem**

Gina, CFO, is getting an email from subcontractor. She feels the hours mentioned in the document are made up and they didn't spend 800 hours onsite in the last one month.

She calls Glenn, the site manager and checks whether the work has been completed as per the invoice. He said 80% completed; but not fully. When she contacted the subbie's contact person, they said we put more subbies to finish the work due to the tight deadline mentioned by Glenn. Now, she is compelled to pay and didn't get the expected outcome either.

Finally, when their client (AMP Shopping centre) did the inspection, they raised many defects. In order to get the invoice cleared from the shopping centre and keep their reputation, they have to fix the defects caused by their subcontractors. A huge blow on their profit margin.

**2. The Broken Workflow**

This is the mechanical process that leads to the pain described above. The critical flaw is the **supporting information** about the hours charged by sub-contractors and when management becomes aware of its financial impact.

| **Step** | **Who's Involved** | **What Happens** | **Point of Failure / Pain Point** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Work Execution** | On-site subbies | The subbies complete their daily work on a project during night time, while their office hours are daytime. | The office site manager works during daytime with no direct visibility of subbie hours. |
| **2. Invoice hours Capture** | On-site subbies | When invoice arrives, no proof is there about the hours charged in the invoice vs actual onsite hours. | Hours are dictated by subbies; no proof to challenge the hours.
"We need to know what time they arrived/left" - Gina. |
| **3. Invoice (data) Collection** | Office admin ("Admin") | Chases site manager for the work completed and hours spent. | Wastes hours on low-value work. Data Inconsistency: Different names for the same job create chaos. |
| **4. Invoice (data)**
**Processing** | CFO ("Accounts") | Nothing to cross verify the hours worked vs invoiced.
Tries to cross verify with site manager. | Wastes hours of CFO's hours on getting into dispute with subbies and eventually have broken relationship and lost in profitability. |
| **5. Reporting** | CFO("Gina") | Reports and profitability is not clear. | No proof of record for the hours worked. The hours are already gone when they get the invoice. |
| **6. Management Review** | Director / CFO ("Gina") | Reviews the overall project cost and it is already gone up, along with re-work on defects. | Gina can only react to a past event. She cannot prevent the cost overruns, only dispute the payment, which damages subbie relationship. She is managing the past, not the present. |

**3. Root Cause Analysis**

Why does this problem persist?

- **Information Lag:** Decisions are made based on assumptions (night work and office works during day), not real-time events.
- **Lack of Proactive Triggers:** There is no "early warning system." No alarm bell rings when a subbie hours are not in match with work progress.
- **Trust-Based, Unverifiable System:** The entire process relies on trusting subbie invoiced hours that cannot be verified.
- **Damaged reputation:** Every manual step in the workflow introduces delays, errors, and administrative waste.

**4. The "Future State": The Swift Check-in Workflow**

High-level overview of what CallPlan does, can use this in your outbound pitches or in marketing.

| **Step** | **Who's Involved** | **What Happens with Swift Check-in** | **The Result** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Site Arrival** | On-site subbie | Subbie scans a job-specific QR code with their phone to check in. | Time, location, and job are captured automatically. No paperwork. No guesswork. |
| **2. Site Departure** | On-site subbie | Crew member scans the QR code to check out. | A secure, geo-tagged record of all hours is created. |
| **3. Invoice Prep** | Site Manager ("Glenn") | Reviews an progress report in Swift Check-in (showing hours worked vs progress) and clicks "Approve." | The process is reduced to a quick review. |
| **4. Invoice Processing** | CFO ("Gina") & MYOB | Clarity on actual hours worked vs invoiced hours. If system can verify hours from check-in records to invoiced, great! | Instant approval and MYOB transfer is saving "half a day". |
| **5. Management Oversight** | Director / Owner ("Gina") | Gina needs to ensure the financial stability of the business by maintaining profitability. | Gina is freed from arguments with the subbies. She can now trust the live data coming from the site, there by manages in the present not in past. |

By understanding this transformation from a broken, reactive process to a streamlined, proactive one, you can now confidently articulate the immense value we provide.
