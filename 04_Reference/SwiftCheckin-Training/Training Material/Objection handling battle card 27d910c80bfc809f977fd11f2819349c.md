# Objection handling battle card

<aside>
💡

like most things you need to practise to build muscle memory. The goal is to have these responses so ingrained that you can deliver them with the right tone (sharp, enthusiastic, and like an expert) without thinking. Remember, an objection isn't a "no," it's a test. It's their way of asking, "Have you earned my time?" 

</aside>

## Part 1: False objections (the smokescreens)

**Your goal:** Get back on the line. Use the **AVM (Acknowledge, Validate, Move On)** technique. Be quick, empathetic, and pivot back to your value prop.

### 1. "I'm on-site / driving / in a meeting"

| **What they really mean** | "You haven't proven this call is more important than what I'm doing right now." |
| --- | --- |
| **Your rebuttal (AVM)** | **A:** "Apologies, mate, I didn't realise you were on-site; thought you would be in the office today. My bad."
**V:** "Look, I'll be very brief."
**M:** "The reason I'm calling is I help roofing contractors like you reduce the costs of unplanned crew overtime. All I want to do is see if it's worth a proper chat. Do you have 30 seconds now?" |
| **Comment** | Your tone here is key. Sound genuinely apologetic but confident. The phrase "My bad" is disarming and human. |

### 2. "We're good / Not interested"

| **What they really mean** | "That's my automatic response to all sales calls. I have no idea what you do." |
| --- | --- |
| **Your rebuttal (AVM)** | **A:** "I appreciate the honesty. Sounds like things are running smoothly, which is great to hear."
**V:** "I won't take up your time..."
**M:** "...but most directors I speak with say the same, yet find a quick look at how we stop profit disappearing from overtime is worthwhile. All I want to do is see if it's worth a proper chat. Do you have 30 seconds now?" |
| **Comment** | This is a pure tone check. If you sound scripted, they'll hang up. If you sound like a genuine expert who believes they can help, they'll give you the 30 seconds. |

### 3. "Just send me an email"

| **What they really mean** | "I want to end this call politely without committing to anything." |
| --- | --- |
| **Your rebuttal (AVM)** | **A:** "Absolutely, I can do that."
**V:** "Just so I don't waste your time with generic info..."
**M:** "...could you quickly tell me, what's your biggest challenge with tracking crew hours right now? That way I can send something that's actually relevant to you." |
| **Comment** | Don't let them off the hook this easily. Agree to their request but use it as leverage to ask one critical discovery question. This turns a dead-end into an opportunity. |

### 4. "I'm not the right person / I'm just the cleaner"

| **What they really mean** | "I'm screening you. I'm the director, but I don't want to talk to another salesperson." |
| --- | --- |
| **Your rebuttal (AVM)** | **A:** "No worries at all, appreciate you letting me know."
**V:** "Sounds like I've got my wires crossed."
**M:** "Just so I can get to the right place, who would be the best person to speak with about making sure crew overtime doesn't eat into project profits?" |
| **Comment** | Call their bluff respectfully. By asking who handles a specific, high-level business problem (profit), you force them to either reveal they're the right person or point you to them. |

### 5. "Call me back later"

| **What they really mean** | "This is a polite way of saying 'never'." |
| --- | --- |
| **Your rebuttal (AVM)** | **A:** "Happy to. I know I've caught you out of the blue."
**V:** "So I can prepare for our chat..."
**M:** "...would you be open to a quick 15-minute slot tomorrow afternoon? I'll send a calendar invite so it's locked in and I don't chase you down when you're busy again. How's 2 PM?" |
| **Comment** | Never accept a vague "call me later." Immediately pivot to locking in a specific time and sending a calendar invite. This separates a real request from a brush-off. |

## Part 2: Real objections (the genuine concerns)

**Your goal:** Reframe their perspective. Use the **FFF (Feel, Felt, Found)** technique. Show deep empathy and use a third-party story to build credibility.

### 1. "We don't have the budget for this"

| **What they really mean** | "I see this as a cost, not an investment. You haven't proven the ROI." |
| --- | --- |
| **Your rebuttal (FFF)** | **Feel:** "Mate, I completely get that. With material costs being what they are these days, every dollar counts, and taking on a new expense is a big deal."

**Felt:** "A lot of the contractors we work with felt the exact same way. They were worried about the monthly cost and saw it purely as another bill to pay."

**Found:** "But what they found after using our system is that they were saving over $1,000 a month just by eliminating 30 minutes of overtime per crew member, per day." |
| **Comment** | Don't argue about the price. Agree that budget is important. Your job is to shift their mindset from "cost" to "money saved." The specific numbers make the story credible. |

### 2. "We already use Simpro / another system"

| **What they really mean** | "I've already invested time and money into a solution, and I don't want the hassle of switching." |
| --- | --- |
| **Your rebuttal (FFF)** | **Feel:** "That's great, Simpro is a solid tool. It makes sense you'd want to stick with what you know."

**Felt:** "We have a lot of customers who also use Simpro for their main job management. They felt their time tracking was covered."

**Found:** "What they found, however, was that Simpro is great for the big picture, but they were still losing money on the small details, like unplanned overtime and travel. They use us alongside it specifically to protect that 10-15% profit margin that was slipping through the cracks." |
| **Comment** | Never attack the competitor. Position yourself as a specialist tool that works with their current system to solve a problem their main tool isn't built for. You're a vitamin, not a painkiller replacement. |

### 3. "We're a small team, we don't need this"

| **What they really mean** | "This sounds like something for big companies. It's probably too complicated and expensive for us." |
| --- | --- |
| **Your rebuttal (FFF)** | **Feel:** "I hear you. It can definitely feel like tools like this are overkill when you're running a tight crew."

**Felt:** "In fact, most of our customers are teams of your size. They felt the same way, thinking they could manage it all on paper or in their head."

**Found:** "What they found was that for a small team, losing just one person for an hour of untracked overtime has a much bigger impact on profit than it does for a big company. Our system actually helped them stay lean and profitable as they grew." |
| **Comment** | Reframe "small" as a strength. In a small business, every dollar and every minute counts more. Your tool is especially valuable for them because the impact of inefficiency is felt more acutely. |

### 4. "We just use paper timesheets/Excel and it's fine"

| **What they really mean** | "It's what we've always done. The pain of our current process isn't big enough for me to consider changing." |
| --- | --- |
| **Your rebuttal (FFF)** | **Feel:** "That's fair enough. If it's not broken, don't fix it, right?"

**Felt:** "A lot of owners we talk to felt that way. They had a system that worked, and the admin person was used to it."

**Found:** "What they found after trying our system for a month was that the 'hidden costs' of paper (like the 5-10 hours their admin spends chasing timesheets and fixing payroll errors each fortnight) were adding up to thousands of dollars a year. They realised 'fine' was actually costing them a lot of money." |
| **Comment** | This is the "cost of inaction" rebuttal. You're not saying their system is bad; you're illuminating the hidden costs they're not seeing. Turn the "nuisance" of paperwork into a quantifiable financial problem. |

### 5. "My crew won't use it / They're not tech-savvy"

| **What they really mean** | "I'm worried about adoption. I don't want to pay for something my team rejects, causing a mutiny." |
| --- | --- |
| **Your rebuttal (FFF)** | **Feel:** "That's a really common and valid concern. The last thing you need is a tool that your crew hates and refuses to use."

**Felt:** "Many of our customers felt the exact same way, especially with older crews who weren't used to apps."

**Found:** "What they found was because our app was designed to be as simple as sending a text message (one tap to check-in, one tap to check-out) even their least tech-savvy guys picked it up in minutes. The crews ended up loving it because it guaranteed their pay was always 100% accurate." |
| **Comment** | Address the fear directly and flip it. The conversation isn't about technology; it's about simplicity and a direct benefit for the crew (getting paid correctly). This turns a perceived negative into a positive for them. |
