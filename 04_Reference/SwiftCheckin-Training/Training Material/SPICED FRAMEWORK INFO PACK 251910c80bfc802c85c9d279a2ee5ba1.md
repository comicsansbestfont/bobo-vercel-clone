# SPICED FRAMEWORK INFO PACK

This document adapts the SPICED framework to align SPECIFICALLY with Swift Check-in's unique market position and sales challenges. The goal is to move from a feature-led, transactional approach to a problem-led, consultative sales process that uncovers real business pain and drives urgency.

# What is SPICED?

SPICED is an acronym that stands for:

- **Situation:** The prospect's current operational context and environment.
- **Pain:** The specific challenges, frustrations, and costs they are experiencing.
- **Impact:** The business consequences of these pains and the desired outcomes of solving them.
- **Critical Event:** The urgent reason or deadline driving the need for an immediate solution.
- **Decision:** The process, criteria, and people involved in making a purchase decision.

This framework is designed for a consultative sales approach, which is essential for our success. It helps us act as trusted advisors who diagnose root causes rather than just pitching features4.

| Category | Consultative Sales (Our Goal) | Transactional Sales (Our Old Way) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Approach** | Focuses on building relationships and deeply understanding the customer's unique business needs. | Centers on quick deals with minimal engagement, focusing on product features. |
| **Process** | Involves comprehensive discovery to uncover underlying challenges and long-term goals using a framework like SPICED. | Involves a short sales cycle with scripted conversations and limited needs exploration. |
| **Value** | Built around solving complex business problems, like labor cost overruns or subcontractor invoice disputes, to deliver measurable ROI5. | Often based on direct benefits like feature comparisons without broader business context. |

## The SPICED Discovery Question Framework for Swift Check-in

This section provides tailored questions to guide discovery calls with our initial Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs): Electrical Contractors and Fit-out Contractors.

### **Situation: U**nderstand the prospect's current process for managing crews, projects, and timesheets and payroll

**Key Focus Areas:**

- **Company Details:** Size, number of employees vs. subcontractors, types of projects (e.g., commercial, residential, industrial).
- **Current Tools & Processes:** Software in use (e.g., Simpro, Procore, Fergus, Hammertech) manual systems (paper timesheets, spreadsheets), payroll software (e.g Xero, MYOB).
- **Workflow:** The step-by-step process from scheduling a job to a crew member checking in, tracking hours and overtime, and processing payroll (and/or verifying subcontractor invoices).
- **Stakeholders:** Who is involved in this process (e.g., Business Owner, Operations Manager, Project Manager, Payroll/Admin staff)?

```c
**Sample Questions:**

- Can you walk me through how you’re currently managing your crew's schedules and tracking their hours?

- What software are you currently using for job management and payroll? How do those systems talk to each other?

- After your team fills out their timesheets, what happens next to get that information ready for payroll?

- How do you currently handle the verification and approval of subcontractor invoices?
```

### **Pain: U**ncover the specific financial and emotional frustrations caused by their current situation.

**Key Focus Areas:**

- **Rational Pain (Financial):** Labor cost overruns eroding profit margins, high administrative costs, revenue leakage from inaccurate invoicing, costs of payroll errors.
- **Emotional Pain (Frustration):** Stress from chasing timesheets, disputes with employees or subcontractors over hours, lack of trust in data, dissatisfaction with current tools.

```c
Sample Questions:

- What are the biggest frustrations or bottlenecks in your current timesheet-to-payroll process?

- Have you ever had a project's profitability impacted by unexpected overtime or inaccurate labor costing?

- Can you tell me about a time you had to deal with a dispute over a employee's (or subbie) hours?

- Who on your team feels the pain of these challenges most acutely?
```

### **Impact:** To quantify the negative business consequences of the pain and articulate the positive outcomes of a solution.

**Key Focus Areas:**

- **Negative Impacts:** How inefficiencies affect project budgets, profitability, cash flow, and team morale.
- **Positive Outcomes (Goals):** Desired improvements such as reduced admin time, improved project profitability, better cash flow, and having a single source of truth for labor costs.
    
    ```c
    Sample Questions:
    
    - What are the biggest frustrations or bottlenecks in your current timesheet-to-payroll process?
    
    - Have you ever had a project's profitability impacted by unexpected overtime or inaccurate labor costing?
    
    - Can you tell me about a time you had to deal with a dispute over a employee's (or subbie) hours?
    
    - Who on your team feels the pain of these challenges most acutely?
    ```
    

### **Critical Event:** To identify OR Create the urgency and "why now" factor that compels a decision.

**Key Focus Areas:**

- **Trigger Events:** A recent major payroll error, a costly invoice dispute, starting a large new project, losing a key admin person who "knows the system."
- **Time Sensitivity:** Upcoming deadlines, end of a financial quarter/year, contract renewals for existing software.
- **Consequences of Inaction:** What happens if they don't solve this problem by a specific date? (e.g., "We'll continue to lose money on projects," "Our admin team is at a breaking point").
    
    ```c
    **Sample Questions:**
    
    - What prompted you to start looking for a better way to manage this now?
    
    - Is there a specific project or deadline on the horizon that makes solving this a priority?
    
    - CWhat are the risks if you continue with your current process for the next six months?
    ```
    

### **Decision**

**Goal:** To map the decision-making process, stakeholders, and evaluation criteria. A key reason for our deals stalling is a lack of clarity on this step11.

**Key Focus Areas:**

- **Decision-Makers:** Identify everyone involved (e.g., Owner, Operations Manager, Finance Manager).
- **Decision Process:** Understand the steps required for approval.
- **Evaluation Criteria:** What standards will they use to judge a solution? (e.g., ease of use for field staff, integration with payroll, ROI).
- **Budget:** Is there an allocated budget, or do we need to build a business case to justify the investment?

```c
**MUST ask questins Questions:**

- Who else on the team needs to be involved in this decision?

- Assuming we can demonstrate how we solve [Pain X] and deliver [Impact Y], what would the next steps look like from your side?

- What are the most important criteria for you when evaluating a solution like this?

```

### Building a One-Page Business Case for Swift Check-in

Not critical right now

---

### Post-Demo Email

It is critical to make sure that we are confirming our understanding of the customer's situation and problem and seek alignment on that. The emails should be short, concise, but give them a high-level overview of the next steps. 

These would have already been confirmed and talked to in the call itself, either directly in the demo or a quick follow-up call the next day. Here is a sample of how to use the understanding from the SPICED to send the poseddemo emails. 

**Subject: Swift Check-in & [Prospect Company] Recap**

Hi [Champion Name],

Thanks for your time today. Just to recap, it was clear that:

> Your team is currently spending over 10 hours a week manually chasing and processing paper timesheets, which leads to payroll errors and a lack of visibility on real-time labor costs.
> 
> 
> This directly impacts project profitability. If not addressed before your large new project starts in [Month], you risk significant budget overruns and further strain on your admin team.
> 

As discussed, Swift Check-in is designed to solve this by automating your entire timesheet-to-payroll workflow.

Here are the proposed next steps:

| Stage | Description | Purpose | Target Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Tailored Deep-Dive** | A focused 30-min session with you and [Other Stakeholder] to demonstrate the specific overtime alerts and job costing reports we discussed. | To confirm Swift Check-in meets your exact success criteria. | [Date] |
| **Pilot Program Outline** | We will draft a no-obligation pilot plan for one of your project crews. | To provide a clear path for you to validate the solution with your team in a live environment. | [Date + 2 days] |

**Action:**

- Please confirm a time that works for the deep-dive session next week.

Best,

[Your Name]
