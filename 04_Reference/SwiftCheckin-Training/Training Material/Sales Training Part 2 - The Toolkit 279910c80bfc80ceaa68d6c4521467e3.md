If Part I was about understanding the "why," Part II is the "how." This is where strategy meets execution. The goal here is to translate your deep customer understanding into powerful, repeatable actions that consistently generate qualified demos with your ideal customers.

# **1 Pre-Call Strategy: The Art of the "Angle"**

Effective outreach is built on relevance, and relevance is a product of research. However, in an early-stage startup, time is the most precious commodity. Many SDRs fall into the trap of over-researching—spending 20 minutes on a deep dive into one account only to learn they're a poor fit—and under-outreaching. Our goal is **swift, impactful research.** You are not writing a biography; you are looking for a key that unlocks the door to a valuable conversation.

The objective is to gather just enough information in a short, time-boxed window to formulate a working hypothesis—an "angle"—that you can use in your outreach. Think of it as a creative, research-based exercise. This angle is the bridge between your research and your reason for calling, and it's what separates a professional, consultative approach from generic spam.

## **Framework: Fast, Disciplined, and Just Enough**

- **Time-Box Your Research:** Spend **no more than 3-5 minutes per account.** This discipline is crucial. It forces you to look for high-impact signals rather than getting lost in the weeds. The goal is to find a hook, not to know their entire business history.
- **What You're Looking For:**
1. **Company Profile:** What is their specialization? Look for specific phrases on their website like "24/7 emergency roof repairs," "fixed-price electrical projects," or "specializing in commercial HVAC." This is a feature of *their* business that you can leverage to show you've done your homework.
2. **Timing Triggers:** Are they hiring for roles like "Project Manager" or more field crew? Did they just announce a big project win on LinkedIn? Did a major storm just hit their primary service area? These are powerful buying signals that indicate immediate, pressing needs that their current systems likely can't handle.
3. **Key Stakeholders:** Quickly map out the decision-makers. In most cases, this will be the Owner/Director. Also, identify the Operations/Project Manager and the Office Manager/Admin, as they feel different aspects of the same operational pain.

## **Crafting Your Angle**

Your research is useless until it's converted into a concise and relevant opening line. Your angle needs to immediately communicate that you are not just another salesperson—you are a problem-solver who understands their world. As we practiced, a powerful angle comes from connecting a public fact about their business to a common industry pain point.

- **Angle 1 (Based on a Company Feature):**
- **Research:** You see on their website they do "fixed-price projects" and "charge upfront."
- **Hypothesis:** For a fixed-price contractor, any untracked labor cost is a direct and irreversible hit to their final profit. They have zero room for error, making cost control paramount.
- **Angle:** "Hi Tom, I saw your company focuses on fixed-price projects. Many directors I speak with find that with this model, the biggest risk is having labor costs blow out, which you only discover at payroll time when it's too late to fix."
- **Angle 2 (Based on a Hiring Trigger):**
- **Research:** You notice on LinkedIn they are hiring two new electrical foremen.
- **Hypothesis:** This growth means more projects, more complexity, and more chaos in coordinating job sites and accurately tracking hours. Their old manual system is likely at its breaking point.
- **Angle:** "Hi Eleanor, I noticed on LinkedIn you're expanding the team and hiring two new foremen. With that kind of growth, I imagine coordinating multiple job sites and ensuring accurate time tracking becomes a major priority."

If you can't find a specific trigger after 3-5 minutes, don't get stuck. As we discussed, you sometimes have to "fake it till you make it." Formulate your best hypothesis based on the industry patterns you've observed. For example: "Most roofing contractors in Queensland we speak with find that managing crew schedules during the unpredictable storm season is a major challenge that often leads to untracked overtime eating into their margins."

# **2 High-Impact Sequences**

A single email or call is not enough. As I said in our session, **sales is a numbers game—a game of touchpoints.** Our prospects are busy and distracted. A **sequence** is a structured, multi-touch, multi-channel campaign designed to be persistent without being a pest. Its job is to methodically initiate contact, nurture interest, and secure a qualified demo.

Remember, research consistently shows that most successful connections happen after the **seventh touchpoint**, yet most people give up after one or two attempts. A sequence is the tool that holds you honest and accountable to a disciplined, professional process. It ensures that promising accounts don't fall through the cracks just because you got busy or forgot to follow up.

**Core Principles of a Great Sequence:**

- **Channel Mix:** Use a strategic variety of channels—phone, email, LinkedIn. Each channel serves a purpose. A call demonstrates high intent, an email allows them to review information on their own time, and a LinkedIn connection adds a layer of professional credibility and social proof.
- **Angle Variety:** This is critical. Do not just "check in" or "follow up." Each touchpoint must offer new value or a different perspective on their problem. Think of it as approaching the same core issue from different angles. One message might not resonate, but another might strike a nerve.
- Touch 1 (Email/Call): Focus on the *owner's* primary pain (e.g., profit leakage from overtime).
- Touch 3 (Email): Focus on the *office manager's* pain (e.g., the chaos of manual payroll and chasing paper timesheets).
- Touch 5 (LinkedIn): Share a case study or a testimonial from a similar company (powerful social proof).
- **Tempo:** The intensity should be front-loaded. More touches early on to establish your presence and break through the noise, then spaced out over time to respect their schedule and avoid fatigue.
- **Completion:** Aim to complete at least 85% of the touches in a sequence. Trust the process. The only reason to stop is if you make a successful connect (a meaningful conversation, a booked demo) or they tell you to "bugger off." If they give you a firm "no," respect their wishes, remove them from the active sequence, and add them to a separate follow-up list for at least one month later.

**Sample 10-Touch Sequence Structure:**

- **Day 1:** Call 1 (Leave Voicemail) + Email 1 (Personalized Opener)
- **Day 3:** Call 2 (No Voicemail - this is a low-effort way to stay top-of-mind)
- **Day 5:** Call 3 + Email 2 (New Angle) + LinkedIn Connection Request
- **Day 7:** Call 4 (No Voicemail)
- **Day 9:** LinkedIn Message (If connected, reference a shared connection or a recent company post)
- **Day 11:** Email 3 (The "Breakup" Email - often highly effective at getting a response)
- **Day 14:** Call 5 (Final Attempt)

# **3 Structuring the Pitch w/ AIDA**

The AIDA model is a 100-year-old framework for persuasive communication that is the foundation of almost all modern sales and marketing. It has stood the test of time because it mirrors the natural human process of making a decision. Whether it's an email, a landing page, or a cold call, the structure is the same.

1. **Attention:** Break through the noise with a personalized hook.
2. **Interest:** Connect to their core problems and show you understand their world.
3. **Desire:** Paint a vivid picture of a positive business outcome (the "promised land").
4. **Action:** Provide a clear, low-friction next step.

## **AIDA Applied to a Prospecting Email**

As I mentioned, the primary goal of the first email is often **not to get a reply.** It's to **create familiarity** so they have a loose idea of who you are when you call them. The job of the email is just that. To achieve this, your message must be **short, sharp, and simple**—enough to be read and understood in under 10 seconds. If you send an essay, it will be ignored.

📧

Hi Mr Customer

**(Attention):** "I saw on your website that your team handles 24/7 emergency roof repairs." - *This specific, researched fact immediately proves it's not spam.*

**(Interest):** "On those urgent, after-hours jobs, how do you currently get visibility on crew overtime before it hits payroll?" - *This is a non-threatening, open-ended question about their process that invites engagement.*

**(Desire):** "We help roofing directors get real-time alerts when a crew is about to hit penalty rates, protecting that 10-15% profit margin that often gets lost." - *Quantifying the value makes the "promised land" tangible and financially compelling.*

**(Action):** "Are you open to a quick sanity check on this next week?" - *The phrase "sanity check" is low-pressure, consultative, and frames the next step as a brief, valuable conversation, not a high-pressure sales pitch.*

## **The Anatomy of a High-Impact Cold Call**

The objective of the cold call is simple: **book a qualified discovery call or demo.** You are not selling the product; you are selling the next 15 minutes of their time. Remember, the prospect has already made a decision about you in the first three seconds. Your delivery and tonality (which we'll cover in Part III) are what bring this structure to life.

**1. Introduction (Opener):**

Your first three seconds determine the outcome of the call. You must be quick, direct, and respectful of their time. The line "I know you're likely on-site..." is a pattern interrupt that shows empathy and immediately disarms them.

"Hi Mr Customer, this is Sachee from Swift Check-in.
I know you're likely on-site or between jobs, so I'll be brief. The reason for the call is that….

</aside>

**2. The Hook (Attention & Interest):**

This is where you deploy your "angle" and immediately prove this isn't a generic sales call. You connect your research to a relevant problem.

<aside>
📧

I saw that Acme Constructions handles 24/7 emergency roof repairs. I work with a lot of roofing contractors like Mr Shingles whom I help manage staff overtime with out platform.

My question to you is, on those urgent, after-hours jobs, **how do you currently get visibility on your crew's overtime before it hits payroll?**

</aside>

**CRITICAL STEP:** **Pause and listen.** This is the most important part of the hook. Your silence invites them to speak and gives you the invaluable information you need to guide the rest of the call. Do not rush to fill the silence.

**3. The Value Proposition (Desire):**

Your response is tailored to their answer, demonstrating that you are listening, not just reciting a script.

<aside>
📧

- **If they have a system** (e.g., "We trust our guys," "Our foremen handle it"):*"That makes sense, and you're not alone in that. A lot of directors we speak with find that even with the best crews, they're still unintentionally losing 10-15% of their profit margin to overtime that gets approved on-site without a final check. Swift Check-in gives you the ability to spot when a crew is about to hit a penalty rate in real-time, so you can protect those margins."*
- **If they DON'T have a system** (e.g., "It's a pain," "We find out when we run payroll"):*"You're not alone in that—it's the most common challenge we hear. Directors often find that lack of visibility is where 10-15% of a job's profit silently disappears. We help you spot those issues before they become costly by giving you real-time visibility when a crew is about to hit a penalty rate. This means you control the overtime costs, not just react to them."*

**4. The Call to Action (Action):**

<aside>
📧

Book the meeting. Make it a low-friction, specific ask. Offering a choice of days ("Tuesday or Thursday") makes it easier for them to respond than an open-ended "When are you free?"

*"Look, I know you're busy and you didn't expect my call. Would you be open to a quick 15-minute chat next week? I'd love to show you how this actually works and you can see if it's even a fit for your team. Would Tuesday or Thursday afternoon work?"*
