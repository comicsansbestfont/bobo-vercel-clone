# Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) & Persona for The "Overtime & Overrun" Contractor

## **Firmographics & Technographics**

| **Attribute** | **Definition** | **Why it Matters for Us** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Industry Vertical** | Electrical Contractors. (Secondary focus: Plumbing, HVAC). | They work on complex, multi-stage projects with tight margins where labor cost control is mission-critical. |
| **Company Size** | 11-50 employees. | Large enough to have significant pain and a budget; small enough for the owner to feel that pain directly. They are often underserved by enterprise software and have outgrown basic apps. |
| **Business Model** | Primarily fixed-price contracts. | Non-negotiable. Revenue is capped per project, so every dollar of unbudgeted overtime is a direct hit to net profit. This creates mission-critical urgency. |
| **Technographics** | Accounting/Payroll: MYOB, Xero. Ops/Job Mgt: Spreadsheets, Google Calendar, Fergus, ServiceM8, Deputy. | They are already using *something*, so we are not selling to a vacuum. Our positioning as a specialized "bolt-on" profit tool is key. Familiarity with MYOB/Xero makes our integration a critical value-add. |

## **The Core Job-to-be-Done (JTBD)**

What is this customer *hiring* Swift Check-in to do?

**"Help me protect my project profitability by giving me real-time, exception-based control over my internal labor costs."**

<aside>
1️⃣

### **Primary Persona: "Steve," the Director / Owner (The Economic Champion)**

**Role & Responsibilities**

He is the business owner. He's responsible for everything from winning new work to ensuring projects are delivered profitably. He spends his time managing client relationships, overseeing operations, and constantly worrying about cash flow and profitability. He's trying to step back from the day-to-day grind but gets pulled back in whenever a project goes off the rails.

**Goals & Motivators (What they want):**

- **Protect Profit Margins:** His #1 goal. He needs to ensure each project makes the money he quoted.
- **Reduce Stress & Firefighting:** He wants a business that runs smoothly without him having to personally check on every detail. He wants to manage by exception.
- **Business Growth:** He wants to take on more projects, but can't if he can't control the costs of his current ones.

**Pains & Frustrations (What keeps them up at night):**

- **Uncontrolled Overtime:** This is his visceral, primary pain. Surprise overtime bills at the end of the week feel like a personal failure and a direct attack on his company's financial health.
- **Lack of Accountability:** He suspects his crews aren't always honest on their timesheets but lacks the irrefutable proof to have a difficult conversation or take disciplinary action.
- **Financial Blindness:** He feels like he's driving blind. He doesn't know he's losing money on a project's labor costs until it's too late to fix it.
- **Operational Drag:** He gets frustrated watching his office manager waste time on manual, low-value work instead of more strategic tasks.

**Success Metrics:** Reducing overtime variance by 30-50%; cutting payroll admin time from hours to minutes.

### **Secondary Persona: "Andrew," the Office / Finance Manager (The Influencer)**

- **Role:** Manages payroll, accounts, and general office administration.
- **Primary Goal:** Efficiency and accuracy. They want to eliminate tedious data entry and automate the payroll process.
- **Pain:** Buried in manual work. They spend hours each week chasing paper timesheets, deciphering notes, and manually entering data into MYOB/Xero.
- **"In Their Own Words":***"An automated system would **save me like half a day**."*
</aside>

<aside>

### **Secondary Persona: The On-Site Manager / Leading Hand (The End User)**

- **Role:** Runs the crew on-site and is responsible for getting the job done.
- **Primary Goal:** A simple, fast way for their crew to log time without hassle, so they can focus on the actual work.
- **Pain:** Finds paperwork and clunky apps annoying. Gets frustrated when blamed for inaccuracies caused by a bad system.
</aside>

**Sales Outreach Execution Guidelines**

**Research & Personalisation Cues:** Look for signals on LinkedIn/company websites: "now hiring electricians," posts about "new projects awarded," mentions of fixed-price work, company values around "on-time, on-budget."

**Do's and Don'ts:**

| **DO** | **DO NOT** |
| --- | --- |
| Lead every conversation with the overtime pain. | Do not lead with "we are a timesheet software." |
| Talk relentlessly about protecting profit margins. | Do not talk about generic benefits like "efficiency." |
| Keep the demo laser-focused on the overtime workflow. | Do not give a "grand tour" of the platform. |
| Use their words back to them (e.g., "exception reporting"). | Do not use corporate jargon. |
| End every call with a concrete next step. | Do not end with a passive "let us know." |

# **Use Case Deep Dive: Overtime & Overrun Control**

**Purpose of this Document:** This document moves beyond *who* our customer is (see our [**ICP & Persona Document**](https://writer.zoho.in/writer/open/adl08c04de635409b448f8450a75b6e4f5e7f)) and dives deep into the *what* and *why* of their core problem.

Its goal is to provide an intimate understanding of the broken workflow we are fixing, so our team can speak with the confidence of an expert who has seen and solved this exact issue countless times.

## **1. The Situation: A Day in the Life of the Overtime Problem**

It’s Thursday morning. Andrew, the office manager, is chasing down the last few paper timesheets from the crew supervisors. The ones he has are crumpled, coffee-stained, and barely legible. He spends the next three hours trying to decipher handwritten notes ("Did they work on 'North St' or 'South St'?") and manually keying every line item into MYOB.

Finally, he exports the data and creates a pivot table for Steve, the owner. Steve scans the report and his stomach drops. The "Main Switchboard Upgrade" project, which was supposed to be highly profitable, has 35 hours of unbudgeted overtime logged against it. The profit margin is gone.

He calls the site foreman, who says, "Yeah, we had some issues on Tuesday and had to stay late." This is the first Steve is hearing about it. The overtime cost has already been incurred. All he can do now is approve the payment and accept the loss, or start a painful argument with his crew about why they won't be paid for hours they've already worked. This is the reactive, stressful cycle we are here to break.

## **2. The Broken Workflow**

This is the mechanical process that leads to the pain described above. The critical flaw is the **information lag** between when work occurs and when management becomes aware of its financial impact.

| **Step** | **Who's Involved** | **What Happens** | **Point of Failure / Pain Point** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Work Execution** | On-site Crew | The crew completes their daily work on a fixed-price project. Some jobs run longer than expected. | The crew is focused on the task, not the budget. Overtime happens without financial oversight. |
| **2. Time Capture** | On-site Crew | At the end of the day or week, the crew fills out a paper timesheet or a basic spreadsheet from memory. | Hours are estimated, not tracked. Fraud Potential: Easy to "round up" hours. |
| **3. Data Collection** | Office Manager ("Andrew") | Chases supervisors for missing timesheets. Tries to decipher handwriting and job names. | Wastes hours on low-value work. Data Inconsistency: Different names for the same job create chaos. |
| **4. Data Processing** | Office Manager ("Andrew") | Manually enters all timesheet data into the accounting system (e.g., MYOB). | "Saves me half a day," says Andrew. Manual entry mistakes can lead to over/underpayment. |
| **5. Reporting** | Office Manager ("Andrew") | Exports data and creates a weekly overtime report (e.g., an Excel pivot table). | The report is created days after the overtime occurred. The money is already spent. |
| **6. Management Review** | Director / Owner ("Steve") | Reviews the report and identifies the profit-killing overtime. | Steve can only react to a past event. He cannot prevent the cost, only dispute the payment, which damages morale. He is managing the past, not the present. |

### **3. Root Cause Analysis**

Why does this problem persist?

- **Information Lag:** Decisions are made based on historical data (last week's timesheets), not real-time events.
- **Lack of Proactive Triggers:** There is no "early warning system." No alarm bell rings when a project is about to go over its labor budget.
- **Trust-Based, Unverifiable System:** The entire process relies on trusting employee-submitted data that cannot be easily verified.
- **Manual Data Transfer:** Every manual step in the workflow introduces delays, errors, and administrative waste.

### **4. The "Future State": The Swift Check-in Workflow**

High-level overview of what CallPlan does, can use this in your outbound pitches or in marketing.

| **Step** | **Who's Involved** | **What Happens with Swift Check-in** | **The Result** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Site Arrival** | On-site Crew | Crew member scans a job-specific QR code with their phone to check in. | Time, location, and job are captured automatically. No paperwork. No guesswork. |
| **2. Site Departure** | On-site Crew | Crew member scans the QR code to check out. | A secure, geo-tagged record of all hours is created. |
| **3. Payroll Prep** | Office Manager ("Andrew") | Reviews an exception-based report in Swift Check-in (only showing flags/overtime) and clicks "Approve." | The process is reduced to a quick review. |
| **4. Payroll Processing** | Office Manager ("Andrew") & MYOB | Approved hours are pushed directly to MYOB with one click. | Data transfer is instant and error-free. The "half a day" of wasted time is recovered. |
| **5. Management Oversight** | Director / Owner ("Steve") | Steve only gets involved if he sees a spike in overtime alerts. Otherwise, he trusts the system is working. | Steve is freed from reactive firefighting and can focus on running the business, confident that profit is being protected. |

By understanding this transformation from a broken, reactive process to a streamlined, proactive one, you can now confidently articulate the immense value we provide.
