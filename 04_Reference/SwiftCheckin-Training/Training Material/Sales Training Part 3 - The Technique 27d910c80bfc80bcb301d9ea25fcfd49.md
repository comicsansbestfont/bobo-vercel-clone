# Sales Training: Part 3 - The Technique

This is where the rubber meets the road. Parts I and II gave you the strategy and the script. Part III gives you the techniques to use when the call inevitably goes off-script. This is about understanding the resilience and skill required for frontline sales. This is also your guide to navigating the toughest conversations, building resilience, and turning "no" into a booked demo.

# 1 The first four seconds: Why your tone is everything

Before you even get to your script, the prospect has already made a subconscious judgment about you.

As we covered, human communication is a complex mix of factors, but when you're on the phone, the game changes dramatically.

- **Words:** 7%
- **Tone of voice:** 38%
- **Body language:** 55%

On a phone call, you lose the single biggest element of communication: body language. This means the 38% that is your tone of voice has to do the heavy lifting. It becomes the primary vehicle for conveying emotion, confidence, and credibility.

You can have the best script in the world, but if your delivery is flat, rushed, or uncertain, you've lost before you've begun.

Within the first four seconds, your tone must convey three critical traits:

1. **Sharp as a tack:** You sound clear, intelligent, prepared, and concise. There's no fumbling or hesitation.
2. **Enthusiastic as hell:** You project genuine energy and a belief in what you're saying. This doesn't mean being loud or over-the-top; it means having a confident, positive inflection.
3. **An expert in your field:** You sound like a credible authority who understands the prospect's world. This is conveyed through confident pacing and industry-specific language.

# 2 Controlling the conversation: "Walk the line"

Think of every sales call as a straight line. The start of the line is your opener ("Hi, it's Nisha from Swift Check-in"). The end of the line is your goal (booking a demo). Your job is to guide the prospect along this line.

The prospect will try to pull you off the line with questions, tangents, and, most commonly, objections.

An objection is a detour. A less experienced rep gets pulled off the line and the call ends in the weeds. A skilled rep acknowledges the detour, handles it, and confidently guides the conversation back to the line. Your call will be a series of these detours. Your success depends on your ability to consistently and respectfully bring the conversation back on track toward the goal.

# 3 The psychology of "no"

The most critical mindset shift you can make is this: **an objection is not a rejection.** It is a request for more information or a signal of uncertainty. When a prospect says "no," they are often really saying, "I don't understand," "I'm not convinced," or "You haven't earned my time yet."

Most initial objections are simply "smokescreens": instinctive, defensive reactions designed to end the call quickly.

**"I don't have time for this right now."** ..often really means:

**"You haven't demonstrated enough value to make this a priority for me."**

Your first job is to diagnose the objection. Is it a real, legitimate concern, or is it a brush-off? We call these false objections and real objections.

- **False objections (smokescreens):** These usually happen at the start of the call. They are vague and designed to get you off the phone. Examples: "I'm in a meeting," "I'm driving," "We're good," "Not interested."
- **Real objections:** These are genuine concerns that come up once the prospect is somewhat engaged. Examples: "We don't have the budget," "We already have Simpro," "My crew won't use it," "We're too small of a team."

# 4 Your objection handling toolkit

To handle these objections and get back on the line, you need proven techniques. These need to be practiced until they become second nature.

## Technique 1: AVM (Acknowledge, Validate, Move On) for false objections

This is your go-to framework for smokescreens and brush-offs. It de-escalates tension, shows respect, and pivots back to the conversation.

- **Acknowledge:** Say you understand and empathize.
- **Validate:** Show them their objection is real and you respect it.
- **Move on:** Pivot back with a question that demonstrates value and asks for a small amount of time.

### AVM example 1

**Objection:** "Look mate, I can't talk right now, I'm on site."

<aside>
💬

**Your response:** "John, apologies, I didn't realise you were on site; thought you might be in the office today. My bad. Look, I'll be very brief. The reason I'm calling is I help roofing contractors reduce the costs of unplanned crew overtime. All I want to do is see if it's worth us having a proper chat. Do you have 30 seconds now?"

</aside>

### AVM example 2

**Objection:** "We're good."

<aside>
💬

**Your response:** "Great to hear that. Look, I'll be really brief. The reason for my call is I help many roofing contractors reduce their unplanned crew overtime. All I want to do is see whether it would be helpful for you as well. Can I grab 30 seconds to have a chat?"

</aside>

## Technique 2: FFF (Feel, Felt, Found) for real objections

This is a powerful, empathy-based framework for addressing genuine concerns, especially those rooted in past experiences or strong opinions.

- **Feel:** Validate their feeling. "I understand how you feel."
- **Felt:** Align with them by sharing that others have felt the same way. "A lot of our customers felt the same way."
- **Found:** Pivot to a new perspective with a third-party story. "But what they found was..."

### FFF example

**Objection:** "It sounds interesting, but we just don't have the budget for this."

<aside>
💬

**Your response:**

**(Feel):** "Mate, I completely get that. With material costs being what they are these days, every dollar counts, and taking on a new expense is a big deal."

**(Felt):** "A lot of the contractors we work with felt the exact same way. They were worried about the monthly cost and saw it purely as another bill to pay."

**(Found):** "But what they found after implementing a system like ours is that they were saving over $1,000 a month just by eliminating 30 minutes of overtime per crew member, per day."

# 5 The reality of the role: It's a numbers game

---

Sales, especially outbound, is a numbers game. Success is not determined by any single call but by consistent, disciplined effort over time. You will face a high volume of rejection.

To build mental resilience, you must focus on what you can control.

- **Controllable inputs:** The number of calls you make, the quality of your research, your delivery of the script, how you handle objections.
- **Uncontrollable outputs:** Whether a prospect says yes or no.

**Detach your self-worth from the outcome of any single interaction.** If you make 40 calls and get 40 rejections, but you executed with quality on every single one, that is a successful day. Trust the process, focus on the inputs, and the results will follow.
