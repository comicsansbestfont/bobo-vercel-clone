# Multi Channel Outbounding

# **The Sequence**

## **Purpose & Philosophy**

This sequence is our primary tool for validating our "Overtime & Overrun" thesis and securing our first 5 paying customers. It is not a blunt instrument; it is a systematic, multi-channel approach designed to surround our prospect with a consistent, valuable message.

**Our guiding principles:**

- **Be Professionally Persistent:** It takes 5-8 touches to earn a conversation. We will be disciplined.
- **Lead with Pain, Not Product:** Every touchpoint is an opportunity to highlight our understanding of their problem.
- **Earn the Right to Their Time:** We will provide value and insight before we ask for a meeting.
- **Sequences are just the Conversation Starters:** The purpose of Sequences is to make an engagement, start a conversation so that we can book a demo.

## **The Strategy**

We will run an 8-touch sequence over 10 business days. This sequence is divided into two "waves" based on the prospect's engagement.

- **WAVE 1 (Days 1-10): The "Overtime & Overrun" Focus.** This is our primary hypothesis. All messaging is 100% focused on solving the pain of uncontrolled employee overtime.
- **WAVE 2 (Days 14-21): The "Subcontractor Verification" Pivot.** It is our test of a secondary hypothesis on a completely disengaged prospect. If they engage with Wave 1 at all, we stay focused on Overtime.

## **WAVE 1: The "Overtime & Overrun" Sequence (Days 0-10)**

**Goal:** Secure a discovery meeting by proving we understand and can solve their most pressing profit leakage problem.

| **Day** | **Channel** | **Action** | **Goal & SPICED Alignment / Script/Template** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0** | **Internal** | **5-Minute Research.** | Find a specific, recent trigger for personalization. Check LinkedIn for project wins, team growth. Check company website for current projects And also start prospecting into the account and identify the top 3-5 people to reach out to. |
| **1** | **LinkedIn** | **View Profile.** | Initial, subtle awareness. The prospect sees your name and title. No connection request yet. |
| **1** | **Email #1** | **First email** | Establish credibility with a highly personalized opening. Introduce the primary pain. |
| **3** | **Phone Call #1** | **Make the first call.** | Land the key discovery question. and earn the right to book a demo. you may not get the demo on the first call so get the discovery down first. If the call connects and you have a conversation you will need to keep following up to book the demo |
| **5** | **LinkedIn** | **Send Connection Request WITHOUT a Note.** | Reinforce credibility and open a new channel. |
| **7** | 📧 **Email #2** | **Follow up email** | Ideally include relevant marketing material. |
| **7** | 📞 **Phone Call #2** | **Make the second call.** |  |
| **10** | 📧 **Email #3** | **Follow up email** | Ideally include relevant marketing material. 
 |

---

## **WAVE 2: The "Subcontractor Verification" Pivot (Triggered on Day 14)**

**Condition for Triggering:** The prospect has had **ZERO** engagement with Wave 1 (no replies, no email opens if tracking is enabled, no connection acceptance). We assume the primary pain did not resonate, so we test the secondary pain.

| **Day** | **Channel** | **Action** | **Goal & SPICED Alignment / Script/Template** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 14 | 📧 Email #4 | Send the "New Angle" Email. | Test a completely different pain point to see if it generates a response eg. Hi [Name], I was originally reaching out about employee overtime, but I was thinking about your business again. A different challenge we solve for firms like yours is eliminating risk from subcontractor invoices. How do you currently verify the hours your subbies are billing you for are accurate? |
| 17 | 📞 Phone Call #3 | Call touch points |  |
| 21 | 📧 Email #5 | Breakup email | Summarize total value and close out the sequence professionally.
Hi [Name], Okay, this is my last attempt. When you're ready to tackle profit leakage—whether it's from employee overtime or inaccurate subbie invoices—let me know. We solve both. Wishing you all the best. [Your Name]. |

## **Response Handling & Next Steps**

- **If they respond positively at any stage:** Immediately pause the sequence. Reply within 2 hours. Offer 2-3 specific time slots for a 15-minute call and include a calendar link.
- **If they say "Not now, check back in X months":** Pause the sequence. Add a task in HubSpot to re-engage at that time. Add them to a long-term nurture list.
- **After 21 days with no response:** The prospect is moved to a "Closed - No Response" status. They can be added to a quarterly, low-touch marketing newsletter. We will not prospect them again for at least 6 months.

# **Outbound Cold Calling**

## **Guiding Principles for All Calls**

1. **Your Goal is NOT to "Sell":** Your goal is to uncover pain, build credibility, and secure a *specific, committed next step*.
2. **Be a Doctor, Not a Vendor:** We diagnose before we prescribe. Ask questions, listen intently, and use their language back to them.
3. **Aim for Conversation, Not a Monologue:** These are frameworks, not word-for-word scripts. The goal is to sound like a confident expert, not a robot. Be prepared to go off-script and handle objections.
4. **Use Open ended questions** or leading questions over closed ended questions.
5. **Respect Their Time:** Get to the point quickly and professionally. An entire call should last 2-4 minutes.
6. **Always Update the CRM:** After every call, immediately log the outcome, notes, and the next scheduled action in HubSpot. This is non-negotiable.

---

## **Call Script Example**

**Context:** This is our first live conversation, following the initial personalized email. They may or may not have seen the email.

**Primary Objective:** To ask our key discovery question and validate that the pain of overtime control exists within their business. **The goal is intelligence, not a meeting and then booking a demo**

---

## **The Flow**

- Introduction
    
    "Hi [Steve], it's [Your Name] calling from Swift Check-in."
    
    *(Slight pause. Let them respond.)*
    
    "I sent you a short email the other day about the [Westfield Parramatta] project. I know you're busy, so I promise to be brief."
    
- Initiate Discovery
    
    "The reason for the call is *[same reason you used in your emails - personalisation. Then link back to project based operations]* We specialize in helping electrical contractors like you protect their project profits—specifically from the costs that leak out through payroll and timesheets."
    
    "I have one quick question for you."
    
- **The Core Question (The most important part)**
    
    "How are you currently tracking when your crew is about to go into overtime?"
    
- **Listen & Navigate** (The conversation begins here) Now, you listen. Based on their response, you navigate to one of the following paths:
    1. Path A: They describe their (manual/broken) process. (e.g., *"The guys fill out paper timesheets, our office manager puts it in a spreadsheet..."*)
        - Your Response (Validate & Dig Deeper):*"Okay, that makes sense. So when do you typically find out about any overtime? Is it at the end of the week when you're doing payroll?"*
        - The Close (Ask for the meeting):*"Look, based on what you've just told me, I'm highly confident we can help. The process you just described is exactly what we fix. Are you open to a 15-minute chat next week where I can show you how we provide real-time alerts on this?"*
    2. Path B: They give an objection. (e.g., *"We use Fergus for that,"* or *"We're fine."*)
        - Your Response:Do not argue. Immediately pivot to the Objection Handling Guide.
        - Example for "We're fine":*"That's great to hear. (Acknowledge) Just so I understand, what does your process look like for flagging potential overtime before the end of the day? (Explore)"*
    3. Path C: They brush you off. (e.g., *"I'm too busy, can't talk."*)
        - Your Response (Graceful Exit):*"I understand completely, [Steve]. No worries. Is it okay if I send a one-line follow-up email with my calendar link?"* (If yes, send. If no, end professionally).
- **Show them a future state.** This is where you will say base on what the prospect has said, that Swift check-in can help them.
    
    "Steve, from what you said, Swift check-in can definitely help you with that and help reduce or eliminate unnecessary overtime. How we do this is by giving your workers the ability to check in and check out. Importantly, it lets you know if a certain staff member has gone over time, and this is reviewed and available for you to catch on a daily basis. Would love to show you how it all works And answer all of your questions.
    
    How is your calendar looking for late this week, early next week?
    
    Who else should we bring in on to the demo to learn more about it?"
    

**Post-Call Action:** Update HubSpot with detailed notes from the conversation. If a meeting is booked, send a calendar invite immediately with a clear agenda.

# **Email Strategy**

## **Introduction - Cut Through the Noise**

Our target prospects—the owners and managers of electrical contracting firms—are on-site, in their truck, or between meetings. They receive dozens of emails a day and have a zero-tolerance policy for generic, time-wasting outreach.

Our mission is to prove, in under 10 seconds, that we are not just another vendor. We are experts in their specific business problem. This guide will teach you the principles and provide the templates to do exactly that.

## **The 7 Principles of Effective Outreach**

*Inspired by best practices and adapted for our ICP.*

1. **Be Short & Simple:** Aim for **50-85 words**. If they can't read it in one glance on their phone, they won't read it at all.
2. **Lead with Their Problem, Not Our Product:** We are selling a solution to "overtime killing my profit," not a timesheet app.
3. **Demonstrate Sharp Research:** Show you understand their current world. A specific project, a recent hire, or a type of work they do proves you're not spamming.
4. **Use Their Language:** Talk about "sparkies," "subbies," and "penalty rates." Speak like an industry insider, not a software salesperson.
5. **Provide Value in Every Touch:** Even if they don't reply, your email should make them think about their business in a new way (e.g., "What *is* the real cost of that overtime?").
6. **Make It Easy to Say Yes:** Our call-to-action (CTA) should be a simple, low-friction question, not a demand for a 30-minute demo.
7. **Create Urgency with Business Context:** Link their problem to real-world events like project deadlines, EOFY, or Fair Work audits.

## **Personalization: Be Specific, Not Generic**

**The Anti-Pattern to Avoid:** Every other salesperson is sending this email: *"Hi Steve, congrats on winning the Westfield tender!"* This is lazy personalization. It's a sales tactic, not an insight.

**Our Approach: Connect the Hook to Their Problem** We must connect our research directly to the pain point we solve. This shows we understand the *implications* of their situation.

| **Instead of this (Weak)...** | **Try this (Strong)...** |
| --- | --- |
| "Congrats on winning the Westfield tender." | "Saw you're on the Westfield tender. On a fixed-price job that size, controlling overtime must be top of mind." |
| "I saw you're hiring Project Managers." | "Noticed you're hiring PMs; usually means you're scaling crews and trying to keep labor costs from spiralling." |

**"Cut the Fluff" :** If your research yields nothing unique or feels forced, do not use it. A confident, direct approach is better than weak personalization. Lead directly with the problem.

## **What to Avoid: The 5 Cardinal Sins of Outreach**

1. **The "Brown Nose":** Avoid over-the-top flattery. "I'm so impressed with your company" feels disingenuous. Specifics are better than superlatives.
2. **The "We-We" Problem:** Don't talk about us. "We do this," "Our platform is great." Keep the focus on **them**—their pain, their situation, their goals.
3. **The "Buzzword Bonanza":** Avoid vague terms like "revolutionize," "game-changing," or "streamline." Use clear, direct language that addresses their specific problem.
4. **The "Novel":** Keep emails under 90 words. Busy people don't read long emails; they delete them.
5. **The "Just Checking In":** Every follow-up must provide new value or a new perspective. Never send an empty "just checking in" email.

## **The Anatomy of Our Emails: A SPICED Breakdown**

Every email we send will follow this simple, four-part structure.

| **Part** | **SPICED Element** | **Purpose** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Attention | **Situation** | Grab their attention with a specific, personalized hook. | *"Hi Sam, saw BrightSpark is on the Westfield Parramatta fit-out."* |
| Interest | **Pain** | Pose a sharp, diagnostic question that reveals their pain point. | *"How do you currently know a crew is about to go into overtime—before the day ends, or only at payroll?"* |
| Desire | **Impact** | Show the ideal outcome by solving that pain. | *"We help owners get an alert at 7.5–8h so they can approve/prevent OT before it hits the books."* |
| **Action** | **Decision** | Ask a simple, low-friction question to start a conversation. | *"Open to a 10-minute sanity check on this?"* |

## **Email Templates**

### **WAVE 1: Overtime & Overrun Focus (Days 1-10)**

```c
**Email 1 With Goal: Establish credibility and introduce the primary pain.**

**Subject Option (Overtime on [Project]?**

Hi [First Name],

Saw [Company] is on the [Westfield Parramatta] project. On a fixed-price job that size, the killer is often learning about overtime at payroll, not on the day it happens.

How do you currently know a crew is about to go into OT—is it a real-time alert, or do you only find out when timesheets hit MYOB?

Open to a 10-minute sanity check on this?

– [Your Name]
```

```c
**Email 2 With Goal: Make the pain tangible with simple math.

Subject Option: Quick math on overtime OR Back-of-the-envelope for [Company]**

Hi [First Name],

Quick math for a [Team Size]-person crew:

2 hrs unplanned OT per person/week × $[Rate incl. penalties] ≈ [calc]/week → ~[annual] p.a. in lost profit.

Do you have an early-warning step (like an alert around 7.5–8h) or does this cost typically surface days later at payroll?

Happy to run your specific numbers in 10 minutes.

– [Your Name]
```

```c
**Email 3 With Goal:  Create urgency and FOMO by professionally closing the loop

Subject Option: Parking overtime alerts for now**

Hi [First Name],

I've been trying to compare notes on preventing overtime surprises on projects like [Project]. I'll assume you’ve got it sorted for now and will park this.

If you ever want to see an “alert at 7.5h + one-click to MYOB” workflow, my door is open.

– [Your Name]
```

### **WAVE 2: Subcontractor Verification Pivot (Trigger on Day 14 if no engagement)**

```c
**Email 4 With Goal:  Test a completely different pain point to see if it generates a response.

Subject Option: 'Different question: subbie invoices'**

Hi [First Name],

When your subcontractors invoice you for hours, how do you verify who was on site, where, and for how long—per specific job area?

We often see a 10-15% variance when this is tracked on a spreadsheet or a site-wide sign-in sheet.

Worth a 10-minute chat to compare proof-of-work approaches?

– [Your Name]
```

```c
**Email 5 With Goal:  Summarize total value and close out the sequence professionally

Subject Option: Last note from me**

Hi [First Name],

Last note from me. When you're ready to tackle profit leakage—whether it's from employee overtime or inaccurate subbie invoices—I'm happy to share a simple workflow for each.

All the best with [Project]. If the timing changes, my calendar is here: [Calendar Link]

– [Your Name]
```
