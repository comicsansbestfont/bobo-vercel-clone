# THE SPICED FRAMEWORK

SPICED is a framework designed to help you effectively diagnose your prospects. Much like a doctor’s approach to treating a patient, your solution should address the root causes of your prospect’s pains, not just the symptoms, to help them achieve their desired outcomes. By systematically organising information using SPICED, you can understand your prospect’s background, challenges, desired impacts, and their commitment timeline to your solution.

The SPICED framework is used across our business from marketing to sales to customer success. 

| **Customer Stage** | **Situation** | **Pain** | **Impact** | **Critical Event** | **Decision** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Lead Generation / Pre-Deal**  | Gather high-level data on company operations, drilling activities, and current systems. | Identify early signs of operational inefficiencies or data inconsistencies. | Understand potential gains from improved workflows and reduced costs. | Identify any upcoming projects or deadlines that may trigger urgency. | Identify key contacts and note early decision-maker signals. |
| **Discovery / Qualification** | Conduct detailed research on workflows, tools, and operational context. | Confirm and quantify both qualitative (frustration, morale) and quantitative pains (lost revenue, time wastage). | Articulate the benefits of addressing these pain points (ROI, efficiency gains). | Uncover deadlines or trigger events that force immediate action. | Map out the decision process and list all stakeholders involved. |
| **Demo & Stakeholder Engagement** | Present a clear picture of the current state vs. the future state with the proposed solution. | Validate the identified pains through interactive discussions. | Demonstrate measurable outcomes (cost savings, improved productivity). | Emphasise time-sensitive triggers that heighten the need for change. | Secure commitment by confirming evaluation criteria and stakeholder buy-in. |
| **POC / Desktop Study** | Integrate and test the solution with real customer data; perform deep workflow and discovery meetings. | Uncover deeper pains, error trends, and opportunities through actual data analysis. | Validate the potential improvements by quantifying actual benefits and uncovering new insights. | Use the trial period to confirm critical events and operational deadlines. | Refine the decision map with additional insights and adjust criteria based on live feedback. |
| **Proposal & Negotiation** | Summarise SPICED findings in a concise business case (one-page format). | Reinforce pain with specific metrics and examples. | Outline the ROI and concrete benefits that the solution will deliver. | Stress the risks of delay or inaction through clear deadlines. | Finalise the decision process and agree on terms and next steps. |
| **Closed Won / Implementation** | Reassess the operational environment before rollout to ensure readiness. |  |  |  |  |
