# Chapter 1: Overview of the SPICED Framework

The SPICED framework is a modern diagnostic tool that transforms sales conversations by helping you uncover and address the core needs of your prospects. Unlike traditional transactional sales approaches—which focus on quick wins and product features—SPICED is designed for strategic consultative sales. This framework ensures that every discussion is deep, customer-centric, and aimed at delivering long-term value.

## What is SPICED?

SPICED is an acronym that stands for:

- **Situation:** Understand the current context and environment of the prospect.
- **Pain:** Identify the challenges and frustrations they are experiencing.
- **Impact:** Determine the effect these challenges have on their business outcomes.
- **Critical Event:** Recognize the urgency and timing that drive the need for a solution.
- **Decision:** Map out the process and criteria for how the prospect will make their purchase decision.

Together, these elements create a structured approach that helps sales teams diagnose a prospect’s needs in depth and tailor solutions that address root causes rather than surface-level symptoms.

## Strategic Consultative Sales vs. Transactional Sales

Understanding the difference between consultative and transactional sales is key to appreciating the value of the SPICED framework. Below is a breakdown of the two approaches:

| **Category** | **Consultative Sales** | **Transactional Sales** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Approach** | - Focuses on building deep relationships and understanding the customer's unique needs.  
- Staff act as trusted advisors guiding a thorough discovery process. | - Centers on quick, one-off deals with minimal engagement.  
- Sales reps focus primarily on product features and immediate benefits. |
| **Process** | - Involves multiple interactions and comprehensive discovery calls with several stakeholders.  
- Emphasises uncovering underlying challenges and long-term goals. 
- Utilises frameworks like SPICED to diagnose issues and tailor solutions. | - Typically involves a short sales cycle with a streamlined, scripted conversation.  
- Fewer interactions and limited exploration of broader needs. 
- Emphasis on closing the sale quickly. |
| **Customer Focus** | - Prioritizes the customer's success and long-term outcomes. 
- Solutions are customized and aligned with strategic objectives for lasting impact. | - Prioritizes immediate purchase decisions and short-term gains.  
- Interactions are product-centric with less focus on long-term success. |
| **Value Proposition** | - Built around solving complex business problems and delivering measurable improvements. 
- Moves beyond immediate features to address broader operational challenges. | - Often based on direct benefits such as cost savings or efficiency improvements. 
- Focuses on immediate product features without broader context. |
| **Relationship** | - Aims to nurture ongoing partnerships with continuous engagement and post-sale support. 
- Encourages repeat business and upsell opportunities through sustained value delivery. | - The connection may end once the sale is made. 
- Little follow-up or ongoing support, which can limit future engagement opportunities. |

### CorePlan’s Customer Deals

Our deals are not transactional - they are consultative (for the most part), high-value deals where understanding the customer's unique challenges leads to tailored solutions and lasting partnerships. In contrast, transactional sales work well for straightforward, lower-value deals where speed and efficiency are prioritised. 

The SPICED framework supports a consultative approach by encouraging in-depth discovery, strategic alignment, and a focus on long-term customer success.
