# Chapter 3: IRL Spanners in Enterprise Sales

Enterprise sales are rarely a linear process. Even with a well-structured methodology, such as the SPICED framework, sellers encounter unpredictable events—“spanners”—that can disrupt the flow of a deal.

## What Are Spanners?

Spanners refer to unexpected events or shifts in the sales process that can derail even the most carefully planned engagements. They often emerge without warning, forcing sellers to quickly adapt their approach. Recognising and preparing for these moments is critical to maintaining momentum and ensuring successful outcomes.

## Detailed Breakdown of Random Moments

### 1. Buyer Reorganisation

- **Description:**
Large organisations typically undergo reorganisation every 12 to 18 months. This can lead to changes in leadership, team structure, and priorities.
- **Impact on Sales:**
    - Existing relationships may need to be rebuilt.
    - Decision-making authority can shift, requiring re-mapping of stakeholders.
    - Previously agreed-upon criteria and timelines may no longer be valid.
- **Strategies:**
    - Continuously update stakeholder maps.
    - Monitor industry news and internal signals from the prospect.
    - Re-engage with key contacts to realign expectations after a reorg.

### 2. Going Dark

- **Description:**
“Going dark” occurs when prospects suddenly stop responding, which might last for days, weeks, or even hours depending on the stage of the cycle.
- **Impact on Sales:**
    - Interrupts the momentum of the deal.
    - Creates uncertainty about the prospect’s level of interest.
    - Can delay decision-making and lengthen the sales cycle.
- **Strategies:**
    - Establish clear follow-up protocols.
    - Use multiple communication channels (email, phone, video).
    - Set expectations early in the process regarding next steps and response times.

### 3. Being Used as a “Racehorse” (Fodder)

- **Description:**
In this scenario, a prospect uses your proposal to negotiate better terms with a competitor. Essentially, you are being leveraged as a benchmark rather than being seen as the frontrunner.
- **Impact on Sales:**
    - Undermines your negotiating power.
    - Can lead to unfavourable terms or pricing pressures.
- **Strategies:**
    - Qualify early to ensure commitment from the prospect.
    - Protect your position by clearly articulating your unique value proposition.
    - Use data and case studies to reinforce your strengths, reducing the prospect’s reliance on comparing prices alone.

### 4. Hurry Up and Wait

- **Description:**
Sellers are often asked to deliver a proposal or response on very short notice, only to experience long periods of silence afterward.
- **Impact on Sales:**
    - Disrupts planning and resource allocation.
    - Creates frustration when urgent responses are not followed by timely feedback.
- **Strategies:**
    - Set clear milestones and communication checkpoints in the process.
    - Prepare contingency plans for extended response times.
    - Use the waiting period to further refine your value proposition and gather additional insights.

### 5. Introduction of a New Decision Maker

- **Description:**
New stakeholders may emerge mid-deal. These individuals can have different priorities or require additional education about the solution.
- **Impact on Sales:**
    - Alters the decision-making dynamic.
    - May require additional meetings and realignment of the sales strategy.
- **Strategies:**
    - Continuously scan the organisation for changes in the decision team.
    - Quickly onboard new decision makers by providing concise, relevant information.
    - Revalidate the buyer’s criteria and adjust your approach as needed.

### 6. Making a Deal Bigger Early On

- **Description:**
Some prospects try to bundle multiple opportunities into one large deal right from the start.
- **Impact on Sales:**
    - Lengthens the sales cycle.
    - Increases complexity and risk, as the deal’s success becomes contingent on the weakest element.
    - May force the prospect into requesting substantial discounts.
- **Strategies:**
    - Carefully assess the feasibility and risks of bundling opportunities.
    - Consider splitting the deal into smaller, manageable phases.
    - Clearly communicate the benefits of a phased approach to maintain deal velocity and protect margins.
