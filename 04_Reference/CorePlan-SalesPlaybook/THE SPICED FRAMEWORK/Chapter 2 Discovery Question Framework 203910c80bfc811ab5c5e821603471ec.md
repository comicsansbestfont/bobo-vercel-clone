# Chapter 2: Discovery Question Framework

SPICED is a framework designed to help you effectively diagnose your prospects. Much like a doctor’s approach to treating a patient, your solution should address the root causes of your prospect’s pains, not just the symptoms, to help them achieve their desired outcomes. By systematically organising information using SPICED, you can understand your prospect’s background, challenges, desired impacts, and their commitment timeline to your solution.

---

## 1. Situation

To gain a complete picture of the prospect’s current operational state in relation to drilling workflow management.

**Key Focus Areas:**

- **Company Details:** Size, number of employees, industry specifics, operational landscape
- **Current Tools & Processes:**
    - Software in use (e.g., drill hole planning tools like Leapfrog, ArcGIS, Micromine)
    - Data management workflows and technologies
- **Drilling Workflow:** Step-by-step process from drill hole planning to daily plod reviews and cost reconciliation
- **Stakeholder Involvement:** Identification of all personnel involved in the process
- **Operational History:** Duration and scale (e.g., number of rigs, projects, contractors)

**Sample Questions:**

- "Can you tell me a little bit about how you’re currently running your drilling operations?"
- "What software are you using for drill hole planning, and how is your data managed?"
- "After receiving spreadsheets from your contractors, what happens next?"
- "How do you handle cost calculations and reconciliations?"

---

## 2. Pain

To uncover the specific challenges and frustrations impacting the prospect at both personal and organizational levels.

**Key Focus Areas:**

- **Emotional Pain:** Frustrations with current workflows or tools causing stress or dissatisfaction
- **Rational Pain:** Financial challenges, such as costly mistakes, revenue leakage, or high operational costs
- **Layered Pain:** Different stakeholders may experience pain differently; the issues might have multiple layers

**Sample Questions:**

- "What are the biggest frustrations with your current process?"
- "Can you explain the challenges you face during the cost reconciliation process?"
- "Who else in your team experiences these challenges, and how do they affect daily operations?"

---

## 3. Impact

To understand both the negative consequences of the current issues and the positive outcomes the prospect hopes to achieve.

**Key Focus Areas:**

- **Negative Impacts:** How inefficiencies affect budgets, productivity, and risk management
- **Positive Outcomes:** Desired improvements (e.g., reduced costs, improved penetration rates, enhanced customer experience)
- **Emotional vs. Rational Benefits:** Recognise that while rational benefits are important, emotional impacts (like reduced stress) can be equally compelling for decision-makers

**Sample Questions:**

- "If you could wave a magic wand and fix your workflow, what would that change mean for your operations?"
- "What KPIs or targets are you aiming to improve with a better system?"
- "How does resolving these issues benefit both your team’s morale and the company's bottom line?"

---

## 4. Critical Event

To identify the urgency behind the need for change by pinpointing triggers and deadlines that drive the prospect’s timeline.

**Key Focus Areas:**

- **Trigger Events:** Recent events or developments that have highlighted the need for a solution
- **Time Sensitivity:** Upcoming deadlines, budget cycles, or specific events that necessitate quick action
- **Consequences of Inaction:** Understanding what negative outcomes may occur if the current timeline is not met

**Sample Questions:**

- "What prompted you to explore changes in your current process now?"
- "When do you need a new solution in place?"
- "What will happen if you miss your targeted timeframe?"

---

## 5. Decision

To map out the decision-making process, ensuring all stakeholders and criteria are considered when selecting a solution.

**Key Focus Areas:**

- **Decision-Makers:** Identify all stakeholders involved in the decision
- **Decision Process:** Outline the steps and approvals required for making a decision
- **Evaluation Criteria:** Standards and benchmarks used to assess potential solutions
- **Budget Considerations:** Clarify whether funds are pre-allocated, discretionary, or need to be justified with a business case

‼️ Lack of discovery on the decision process is the key reason for deals getting pushed down the calendar or losing momentum and dying a slow death.

**Must Ask Questions**

1. How long did the last purchase like this take?
2. Who else needs to be on board with the decision?
3. Could you walk me through the steps in the process?
4. Who is involved/has influence at those step of the process?
5. What decisions need to be made at each step?
6. What could speed up or slow down the process?
7. Besides yourself, is there anyone else required to approve a purchase of this size?
8. What kind of timelines are you working towards to solve for this?
9. Assuming we deliver X (e.g., a successful desktop study), could you walk me through what the next steps will be after that?
10. Won't you have to get some buy in from person X to move forward?

Additional

- What budget is available for this change, and how is it allocated? (Would they need to create a budget or extract from elsewhere)
- "Are there any other solutions you are currently evaluating?"

☝

The “I” and “CE” of SPICED are not always uncovered in this order. If a prospect is aware they have a problem and educated on the different solutions available, they may tell you their desired Impacts and Critical Event in the first qualification call. Unfortunately, this doesn’t happen very often—but when you’re **actively listening**, sometimes you can pick up on clues very early in the sales cycle and tease out Impacts and Critical Events with further questioning.

## Multi-Stakeholder Mapping

For a high-quality deal, it’s critical to assess the SPICED components not only overall but also for individual stakeholders. A mapping table can help:

|  | Overall | Stakeholder 1 | Stakeholder 2 | Stakeholder 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Situation** |  |  |  |  |
| **Pain** |  |  |  |  |
| **Impact (Negative)** |  |  |  |  |
| **Impact (Goals)** |  |  |  |  |
| **Critical Event** |  |  |  |  |
| **Decision Process** |  |  |  |  |
| **Decision Criteria** |  |  |  |  |
