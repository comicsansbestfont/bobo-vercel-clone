# Chapter 5: Post Demo Email Game WIP

# Post Demo Emails to individuals or groups

The typical post-demo email is a stack of links, padded with pleasant comments. with links. lots of links. I cringe. Looking at my own emails. I cringe harder. This puts the work back on the buyer, and it’s too product centric.

*Subject: Re: Recap, [Company Name] 🤝 [Client Company name]

Hi **John**, appreciated the time and the transparent feedback earlier. 

You mentioned that instead of < current process >, you’d like to < future process >. 

Which will enable you to < approach: optimise your penetration rates , get transparency into drilling costs, reduce operational overhead on data workflows >.

Ideally, this leads to < good outcomes: define the ore body as fast as possible with the highest quality, bring budget vs actual to under 5%, reduce time to reconcile invoices from 20 days to 1>.  

(Personal goals : Love how you mentioned that moving to an IDMP will help them learn more modern data integration methods, understand data analytics etc. We're big on this and can give you best practises )

But if this change isn’t made before < timing >, you’ll be looking at < cost of the problem >.

To avoid that, here’s a recap on how < successful customer > uses CorePlan to achieve XYZ.

- Since < Another person > runs the database, operations think we could get her input?
or, 
- Have we hit the mark here?* I've got the documentation to CorePlan as well as the notes in this shared room [here](https://coreplan.flowla.com/r/02ae8062-2f64-4673-a916-960f600bea93), which includes links to the call and the plans.

Many thanks, Sachee

📊 Hey Carl, Tony, and Dominic,

It was great to connect earlier and understand what you're looking for and the challenges.

We heard loud and clear that instead of wasting valuable time reconciling data across spreadsheets and chasing down information - you'd like to have a centralised platform that provides real-time visibility into your drilling program progress and costs.

Consolidating all the notes as we understand it's so:

You can instantly see how actual drilling costs are tracking against your bud et, hole by hole, rig by rig.
- Manage the field operations of the program to line up with the overall drilling - and ensuring things are done.
- Your geologists are freed from tedious data entry to focus on what they do best – analysing results and guiding your exploration strategy.
- Remove the uncessary time spent on trying to uncover what's happenning, now

However, if a solution isn’t implemented before your next drilling campaign starts in Q4, those inefficiencies you mentioned – the manual reconciliation, the lack of real-time visibility, and the under-utilisation of your geologists' expertise – will only intensify as your drilling programs expand.

Have we hit the mark here? I've got the documentation to CorePlan as well as the notes in this shared room [here](https://coreplan.flowla.com/r/02ae8062-2f64-4673-a916-960f600bea93), which includes links to the call and the plans.

Let's set up a next session which would comprise of a Q&A and a deeper dive into your use case. We have the following slots available, when suits?

- 27 Jun (Thurs): Between 11:30AM - 3PM
- 28 Jun (Fri): After 2PM
- 1 Jul (Mon): Between 11:30AM - 3PM
- 2 Jul (Tues): After 1PM

Looking forward to our next chat!

Hi Greg, Roby and Christine,

Thanks for your time yesterday. Just to recap what we heard loud and clear was that:

> Every month, at least three team members in finance (Greg, Robbie, Christine) are overwhelmed by the manual data consolidation and reporting processes stemming from the incompatibility between the new drilling data capture systems and (Pronto). This costs you not just in valuable time but  also introduces opportunities for error, and delays timely invoicing. This leads to large lag in work completed to cash in bank.
> 
> 
> If this is not addressed by October 2024, when Reflex is being discontinued, you may face significant operational disruption, increased risk of financial inaccuracies, and potential damage to client relationships due to inconsistent and delayed reporting.
> 

The CorePlan platform is built specifically for the financial operations of drilling companies such as yours and we are happy to demonstrate the capability to address your requirements in the following manner:

| Stage | Description | Purpose | Target Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop Study | to be conducted using backloaded data OR using existing Stanmore data for a period of 2 billing periods. | Satisfy the capatibility of CorePlan's ability for configured export and integration with Pronto | 15th of August Completion |
| Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment | Identify and engage relevant stakeholders outside of finance for development of business case | Develop success criteria for proof of concept so you can do your due diligence on CorePlan | Prior to Proof of Concept |
| Proof of concept | Use CorePlan in a live operating environment, end to end. | Get operations buy in from a pilot team for proof of concept and explore full capabilities of CorePlan | Mid to late  August commencement |

Actions:

- Please provide us 2 billing cycles of your data + 2 invoices + your relevant schedule of rates and charges for us to backload and configure a project.
    - If Stanmore please specify dates and we can pull in data from that period, with their approval
- Please send us example exports of your Pronto configured export for this project ( we have an earlier sample from a few months ago but please resend to ensure accuracy.
- Agree on date for demonstration via desktop study of a configured export.
- Roby, I will call you next week to discuss the above and coordinate next steps

Further information:

- I have put in [more information about CorePlan here](https://gday.coreplan.io/e3t/Ctc/2M+23284/d11yJ-04/Jl22-6qcW7lCdLW6lZ3mfVpPYkt7gPT8qW5CPF_886wLRjVbpW_x3fS_mTW5MFlCs7f6VWPW4gCKzB5T8B3hW2PdWvc4R722tVK_3N08D0fDTW1_W29C6Q0wQrVskKMh63zDM4W2H-Nxf2tydC3W29xLwG8tmxCpW2s7vkx2DmhHfW5LBDdV6N6l9rW5wzsbN3QBf1tW1qJ_R37Grx4qW89SVj-74NWGmW16lRBg1VVMdkW6p4V021WqB4dW8ks3lH1q3v3hW53xYD37w5tBJW3RJ3Lz5X1Rp2W6WBDQ_5RzpgdW18LjnJ3q9hxQW747vqr8ZSwsLf9dZmBF04)
