# Chapter 4: Business Case Development (incl examples)

Writing a one-page business case using SPICED involves two phases: **discovery** (diagnose the situation with SPICED to gather facts, pains, and requirements) and **delivery** (write a crisp narrative that presents the solution in the customer’s terms). By applying a one-page framework, you ensure the business case hits all the high notes – a sharp problem definition, a compelling solution, clear benefits, and concrete metrics – all in a format designed for enterprise buying committees. 

This approach is particularly powerful for long-cycle sales in industries like mining, where success hinges on enabling your champion and simplifying complex decisions. A well-crafted one-page business case not only increases your chances of getting executive buy-in and budget approval , but it also accelerates the deal by aligning all players around a common vision of success. It becomes the story that everyone, seller and buyer alike, refers to as they move together toward a signed agreement and a successful project kickoff.

## **Why a One-Page Business Case?**

In complex enterprise sales – like those in the mining industry – deals have long cycles, many stakeholders, and high stakes. A concise **one-page business case** helps *bridge the gap* between your direct sales meetings and the buyer’s internal discussions . Instead of overwhelming decision-makers with lengthy documents, a one-pager distills the key points into an executive-friendly format. We need to be equipping an internal champion with a clear, compelling case they can socialise within their organisation. 

This document becomes the single source of truth that guides all selling and buying activities in the deal, aligning everyone on the problem, solution, and value at stake . It ensures your message stays controlled even when you’re not in the room, and it empowers your champion to advocate effectively on your behalf . In short, a one-page business case is both your **sales playbook** and the buyer’s **internal pitch** in written form.

## **Leveraging SPICED for Discovery**

Before writing the business case, you need rich insight into the customer’s situation – this is where the **SPICED framework** comes in. SPICED is a five-step sales methodology (Situation, Pain, Impact, Critical Event, Decision) that helps you diagnose the customer’s needs and context systematically. 

By using SPICED throughout discovery, you gather all the ingredients for a strong business case:

- **Situation:** The facts and context about the customer’s current environment (industry, operations, tools, processes, etc.), giving a baseline for where they stand today . This means understanding the  company’s drilling workflows, systems like Krux or custom or manual processes in place, and any relevant projects or goals.
- **Pain:** The acute challenges or frustrations they are experiencing. These pains may be quantitative (e.g. *“we lose 20% of time to inefficient data entry”*) or qualitative (*“teams are frustrated by the slow reporting”*)  . Identifying pain points helps pinpoint the problem your solution must solve.
- **Impact:** The results or outcomes the customer seeks by solving those pains – essentially the “why it matters.” Impacts can be rational (increased production, reduced costs) or emotional (team satisfaction, confidence in data) . In discovery, make sure to uncover not just what the problem is, but what **improvement or benefit** the buyer is aiming for if the problem is resolved.
- **Critical Event:** The “why now” factor – any deadline or time-bound event that adds urgency. Perhaps a contract renewal, a project start date, or a looming operational target is forcing a decision by a certain date . Ask what happens if they miss that deadline, to gauge how critical it really is. Understanding any compelling or critical event helps you emphasize urgency in the case.
- **Decision:** Insight into *how* the decision will be made – who will approve, what criteria they care about, and what the process looks like . Enterprise deals in mining often involve a committee (operations managers, IT, finance, procurement, etc.), each with their own concerns. Knowing the decision-makers and criteria ensures your business case addresses the points that matter to all of them (e.g. IT might care about integration, finance about ROI, operations about usability).

This diagnostic approach not only uncovers the root causes (like the fundamental limitations of a legacy system) but also helps the prospect themselves realize the cost of not changing and ultimately THE VALUE. All of these insights will feed directly into the one-page business case structure.

## **Structuring the One-Page Business Case**

A one-page business case format has become a popular standard because it concisely captures the **problem, solution, and payoff** in a way that busy executives can quickly grasp  . CorePlan’s own business case template is aligned with this approach. The document is typically divided into a few key sections, each serving a specific purpose:

<aside>
💰

**Headline**

A one-sentence executive summary that names the *recommendation and timeline* and highlights the outcome if adopted (and the risk if not). This is the attention-grabber for executives. For example, CorePlan’s template uses a formula like: *“[Business unit] should [take X action] by [date]. This will result in [desired outcome], while avoiding [the cost/risk] caused by [current problem]”* . A strong headline distills *what* you want the customer to do and *why*, in terms that tie to a high-priority objective. It sets the stage by promising a payoff and hinting at the pain if they delay.

</aside>

<aside>
💰

**Situation & Problem Statement**

A brief paragraph outlining the customer’s current situation and the core problem to be solved. This section should state **who** is impacted and how, quantify or illustrate the pain, connect it to a larger business goal, and explain why the problem is becoming pressing . In other words, describe the *symptoms* and context: e.g. “Despite using [Current System], the drilling team struggles with X and Y, leading to Z inefficiencies, which threatens our ability to meet [Company Goal].” This paints a clear picture of the status quo and what’s at stake. Keep it factual and grounded in the specifics you learned (e.g. *“data inconsistencies in DragonView are causing 15% overhead in manual corrections”*), so that the reader agrees “yes, that is our problem.”

</aside>

<aside>
💰

**Root Cause & Impact (Why Now):** 

Next, explain **why the problem exists and the impact if it’s not addressed soon**. Identify the root cause driving the pain – for instance, *“a mismatch between current tools and our complex contract structures”*. Then spell out the likely consequences of doing nothing, especially in light of any critical timing. This essentially answers, “Why must we solve this *now*?”  For example, *“If we continue on the current path, we face increasing cost inaccuracies and project delays, especially with the upcoming expansion (critical event).”* In the CorePlan template, this is where you’d incorporate any compelling event or deadline: *“By Q3 next year (deadline), if we haven’t solved this, we risk [major impact]…”* . Showing the looming impact of inaction creates a sense of urgency for the decision-makers. It turns the problem from a nagging issue into a mission-critical priority.

</aside>

<aside>
💰

**Recommendation (Solution Approach):** 

After framing the problem and urgency, present the **recommended solution** in a concise way. This section outlines *what you propose to do* and *why it’s the right approach*. Focus on the approach at a high level (agnostic of any one vendor or product features, if possible) – you want the customer to first agree *on the solution strategy*. 

For example: *“We should implement CorePlan for drilling operations management”* – and then support it with evidence or rationale. Highlight how this approach addresses the root cause and how it differs from or improves upon alternative solutions (e.g. *“Unlike trying to customize our old system or manage via spreadsheets, this will provide real-time integration with contractors’ systems and scalability for future needs.”*). 

If there were other options considered (consulting, in-house builds, status quo), you can implicitly address them by noting why your recommendation best meets all the requirements. Include proof points or precedents to build credibility – such as pilot results or success stories (*“Already used by X, Y, Z leading mining firms”*) to show the approach is tested . Additionally, note any **resources or investment required** for this recommendation and any key steps to implement (for instance, mention if it requires a certain budget approval, a 3-month rollout, training, etc.). The CorePlan template specifically prompts including how to resource the implementation and the investment needed . 

By being upfront about the necessary investment and effort, you help the reader weigh it against the payoff. The goal is for the reader to nod along and think, “This solution makes sense – it’s feasible and addresses our needs.”

</aside>

<aside>
💰

**Metrics & ROI**

Finally, conclude with the **metrics that matter** – the expected outcomes and benefits in measurable terms. This section highlights the *payoff* of adopting the recommendation, ideally in the form of improved KPIs or goal attainment. It often helps to present a **“Current vs. Future State”** comparison for key metrics . For example, you might list metrics like *“Manual data reconciliation time: 40 hours/week (current) -> 5 hours/week (with CorePlan)”* or *“Drilling budget variance: 15% -> <5%”*. 

Tie these improvements to the customer’s stated goals or executive-level KPIs (safety, cost per meter drilled, production rate, etc.). 

By quantifying the benefits, you speak to both technical stakeholders and financial decision-makers in concrete terms. This is essentially the **business impact** or ROI section of your case. It should demonstrate that the recommended change will deliver meaningful results – either driving revenue up, costs down, efficiency up, risk down, or ideally some combination of these. If exact numbers are hard to get, even directional improvements or credible estimates can bolster the case (for instance, using data from similar deployments or industry benchmarks). The reader should finish this section convinced that the potential *value* far outweighs the *cost* of the project.

</aside>

All of the above sections should ideally fit on **one page** (or one well-formatted slide) in total. The writing should be straightforward and free of fluff – focus on facts, insights, and clear statements. A good one-page business case reads almost like an internal memo: crisp and to the point.

### Why we need to develop a business case

**Long, Complex Sales Cycles:** Mining deals take a long time with lots of meetings. A short business case helps keep eve**rything organized** and moving. It's easy **to share**, so everyone stays updated and can pass it along to new team m*embers.* It keeps working for you even when you're not around by showing what to do next and when, like noting deadlines.

**Multiple Decision-Makers (Technical and Non-Technical):** Buying decisions in mining include technical experts and managers who think differently. The business case **speaks to all** by addressing the concerns of managers and satisfying engineers with details. Use **language** from your conversations so it fits well with their views. Focus on simple examples everyone gets instead of complicated words. When an engineer discusses 'system inflexibility' or a manager talks about 'cost overruns,' use those terms to show you listened well. Keeping it concise means everyone gets the main ideas quickly, no matter their expertise.

**Guiding Non-Linear Decision Making:** Enterprise buying decisions don't follow a straight path. Stakeholders often revisit topics, consider different options, or bring in new people. A good business case acts like a *guide for this process,* helping when discussions become repetitive or new suggestions are made, like consulting or in-house projects. It **compares every option** based on clear criteria like the problem, outcomes, and deadlines. For instance, if hiring more staff is suggested instead of buying software, the case *shows time* and money *saved by your s*olution. Similarly, it highlights how your approach meets specific needs without delays, unlike custom solutions. The document *makes* it easier for buyers to see your solution's benefits over others by showing criteria and outcomes clearly. This keeps everyone on **the same** page and lessens the chance of last-minute objections.

**Catering to Varying Expertise and Priorities:** Each stakeholder in a mining company will view the deal from a different lens – e.g. the Exploration Manager might worry about usability in the field, the CIO about integration security, the CFO about ROI, etc. The one-page business case allows you to **cover the high-level points that matter to all**, while leaving detailed specifics for appendices or follow-up. Because it’s grounded in SPICED, it makes sure to address both rational and emotional factors: the *rational* metrics and ROI for the financially minded, and the *emotional* assurances (like reducing personal risk or aligning with strategic initiatives) for senior sponsors  . The “Metrics that Matter” section can feature a mix of efficiency gains (speaking to operations/IT) and financial outcomes (speaking to executives). And by co-authoring the content with your champion, you’ve likely incorporated input from multiple departments (since a good champion will gather perspectives). Get all stakeholders alinged to create a *“multithreaded validation from different points of view”* in building the case . That means the final document should reflect a well-rounded case, not just a narrow vendor pitch. When stakeholders with different expertise read it, they each find something relevant to their interests, increasing consensus.

**Maintaining Urgency and Priority:** Sometimes, projects lose urgency in long sales cycles. A good business case emphasizes de**ad**lines and costs of delay to keep thi*ngs moving*. Updating the one-pager with new details is simple, like adding notes about IT concerns. This shows all depa*rtments* why the project matters now, not later, which helps close deals quicker.
