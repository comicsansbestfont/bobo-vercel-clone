# Marketing Funnel

In mining, we’re almost always dealing with long and complex sales cycles. And typically the deal values are significantly higher. Enterprise deals in other industries are equivalent to a midmarket deal in our world. 

The issues our customers encounter can be technically complex, yet often appear quite simple. From the customer's perspective, there are typically numerous solutions - consulting services, custom builds, improved internal processes, etc.

And not all of these people might be commercially savvy, technologically savvy or the subject matter expert in an actual drilling operations workflow.

We have to meet where the customer is at and cater our sales strategy to help the customer navigate this decision making. And it’s not a straight arrow or line either.

Our customers are either highly educated geologists/scientists and our marketing needs to stand out to them yes through our brand persona BUT also carry a significant level of authority. 

This can only be displayed through a high level of detail in understanding their [jobs to be done](https://www.notion.so/06efd5a51eb847ba98f85e96dd6682c8?pvs=21) and creating our marketing content and distribution that speaks to them where they are and at their level. This means being 1) stupidly obvious about what we’re talking about AND 2) being highly detailed and SPECIFIC about their problem, the impact and the proposed solution. Anything otherwise we lose all credibility.

The mining ecosystem is large but concentrated into handful of opportunities. And we usually get one attempt at winning. So let’s make it count.
