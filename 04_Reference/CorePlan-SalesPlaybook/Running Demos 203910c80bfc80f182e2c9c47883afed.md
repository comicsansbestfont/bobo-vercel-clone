## Introduction

When conducting demos, it's crucial to understand the customer's context and tailor your approach accordingly. Here's how to run both outbound and inbound scenarios:

### **Outbound Demos**

When we are in front of prospects that have come because we’ve reached out to them they typically:

```
1.	Accept meetings due to frustrations with their drilling operations.
2.	Lack a full understanding of how technology can solve these complex issues.
3.	Focus on narrow, point solutions rather than addressing the root causes of their operational challenges.

```

### **Inbound Demos**

For inbound demos, people typically have:

```
1. A clearly defined problem they're actively seeking to solve (e.g., streamlining drill program management)
2. High intent to find a solution to improve their drilling operations
3. Curiosity about available options in the market specifically designed for the mining industry
```

**In either case your demo strategy should:**

1. Lead with storytelling around core problems we solve in drilling operations
2. Educate them on the symptoms and underlying issues specific to mining exploration and production
3. Help them understand the critical challenges in their drilling programs, data management, and cost control
4. Build interest by connecting their specific pain points (e.g., inefficient data collection, budget overruns) to CorePlan
5. Create desire for a comprehensive approach rather than a band-aid fix

<aside>
🚨 **Critical:** Diving straight into excessive questions may not yield the best results unless you're dealing with problem-aware stakeholders or there's an urgent critical event driving their interest. Be patient and strategic with your questions.

### **Best Practices**

- Integrate questions throughout the demo to uncover the customer's Situation, Pain points, Impact, Critical events, and Evaluation criteria (SPICE) related to their drilling operations
- Use open-ended questions to encourage detailed responses about their specific drilling challenges
- Share relevant stories and examples from other mining companies, followed by probing questions
- Ask leading questions to guide the conversation towards critical issues in their drilling operations and data management

### **Objectives of the Demo**

- **Drive the strategic narrative** to educate on the new world of drilling operations and establish yourself as the guide
- Understand their SPICE(D)
- If problem unaware, **help them understand** the challenges in their drilling operations
- **Confirm their NEED** for an integrated drilling management solution and commitment for next steps
- Identify key stakeholders in the process (e.g., exploration managers, geologists, data managers)
- Book a second, more detailed demo

By following this refined approach, you'll be better equipped to demonstrate how CorePlan can address the unique challenges demonstrate your care and active listening, reaffirms the focus on their needs, and opens the door for an open honest conversation. 

+ Sets you up as the person that’s helping them make the decision to buy and the expert VS trying to sell something.

### Key Points to Remember

1. Balance the demo with discovery questions throughout to keep the prospect engaged.
2. Give indications of pricing if asked, based on main plans from the website.
3. Don't offer a quote without confirming SPICED with all decision-makers.
4. Avoid grilling them with questions in one burst while stuck on one slide.
5. Don't talk at them without understanding the specific drilling problems they're trying to solve.
