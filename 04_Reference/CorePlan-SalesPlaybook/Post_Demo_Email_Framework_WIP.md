📊Hey Car l, Tony, and Dominic,
It was gr eat to connect e arlier and underst and what y ou're looking f or 
and the challenges.
We he ard loud and cle ar that inst ead of wasting v aluable time  
reconciling dat a acr oss spr eadsheet s and chasing do wn inf ormation -  
you'd lik e to ha ve a centralised plat form that pr ovides r eal-time visibilit y 
into your dr illing pr ogram pr ogress and cost s.
Consolidating all the not es as w e underst and it's so:
You c an inst antly see ho w actual dr illing cost s are tracking against y our 
bud et, hole b y hole, r ig by rig.
 Manage the field operations of the pr ogram t o line up with the o verall  
drilling - and ensur ing things ar e done.
 Your geologist s are freed fr om t edious dat a entr y to focus on what the y 
do best – anal ysing r esul ts and guiding y our e xploration strat egy.
 Remo ve the uncessar y time spent on tr ying t o unco ver what's  
happenning, no w
However, if a solution isn ʼt implement ed bef ore your ne xt drilling  
camp aign st arts in Q4 , those inef ficiencies y ou mentioned – the manual  
reconciliation, the lack of r eal-time visibilit y, and the under -utilisation of  
your geologist s' exper tise – will onl y int ensify as y our dr illing pr ograms  
expand.
Have we hit the mar k her e? I'v e got the document ation t o Cor ePlan as

Hi Gr eg, R oby and Chr istine,
Thanks f or your time y esterday. Just t o recap what w e he ard loud and cle ar was

Every month, at le ast thr ee team members in finance Gr eg, R obbie, Chr istine ) 
are overwhelmed b y the manual dat a consolidation and r epor ting pr ocesses  
stemming fr om the incomp atibilit y bet ween the ne w dr illing dat a captur e 
syst ems and Pr onto). This cost s you not just in v aluable time but  also  
introduces oppor tunities f or er ror, and dela ys timel y invoicing. This le ads t o 
large lag in w ork complet ed to cash in b ank.
If this is not addr essed b y Oct ober 202 4, when R eflex is being discontinued,  
you ma y face signific ant operational disruption, incr eased r isk of financial  
inaccuracies, and pot ential damage t o client r elationships due t o inconsist ent 
and dela yed repor ting.
The Cor ePlan plat form is buil t specific ally for the financial operations of dr illing  
comp anies such as y ours and w e are happ y to demonstrat e the c apabilit y to
