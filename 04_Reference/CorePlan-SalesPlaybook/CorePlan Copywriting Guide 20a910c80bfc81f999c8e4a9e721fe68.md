# CorePlan Copywriting Guide

In mining, we’re almost always dealing with long and complex sales cycles. And typically the deal values are significantly higher. Enterprise deals in other industries are equivalent to a midmarket deal in our world.

The issues our customers encounter can be technically complex, yet often appear quite simple. From the customer's perspective, there are typically numerous solutions - consulting services, custom builds, improved internal processes, etc.

And not all of these people might be commercially savvy, technologically savvy or the subject matter expert in an actual drilling operations workflow.

We have to meet where the customer is at and cater our sales strategy to help the customer navigate this decision making. And it’s not a straight arrow or line either.

Our customers are either highly educated geologists/scientists and our marketing needs to stand out to them yes through our brand persona BUT also carry a significant level of authority.

This can only be displayed through a high level of detail in understanding their [jobs to be done](https://www.notion.so/Jobs-to-be-done-Framework-20a910c80bfc8172acfce0f926a7c14b?pvs=21) and creating our marketing content and distribution that speaks to them where they are and at their level. 

This means being 1) stupidly obvious about what we’re talking about AND 2) being highly detailed and SPECIFIC about their problem, the impact and the proposed solution. Anything otherwise we lose all credibility.

Our content needs to bridge this gap, speaking with authority to a scientifically savvy audience while guiding them through a nuanced decision-making process.

**Think of it like this:** Imagine explaining a complex geological concept to both a seasoned geologist and a CEO with limited technical knowledge. You need to be accurate and insightful for the expert while remaining clear and engaging for the executive.

**Cut to the chase**

 If you’re explaining something, don’t wait three paragraphs to do so. Start with the explanation and expand later. Most articles can be improved by making the intro shorter and more direct. Two short paragraphs, or less, is preferable, though there will always be exceptions.

**Be opinionated but NOT confrontational**

CorePlan isn't afraid to take a stand. We provide clear, well-researched opinions, offering valuable insights to our readers. Things like “Geological database vs CorePlan - this grinds the gears of many a DBA in mining companies, especially those tinkers that love over complicating”. A touch of controversy sparks interest and keeps things engaging. We maintain a conversational tone that's both approachable and authoritative.

Because we have two products, two sides of the coin, be careful to sound confrontational and pit them against each other.

**Get Pointy, Answer the ‘so what?’ with stories**

Every piece of content needs to answer one question: "Is this relevant and valuable to our mining audience?" If not, it's back to the drawing board. Sprinkle in relatable real world examples to illustrate and connect technical details back to the practical benefits for the reader. Speak like a person  Think: "So what this means for your drilling operation is..." .

how to do this?

- **Operational situations:** Always communicate clear scenarios and use cases instead of general vague ones.
- **Call out Impact:** Highlight urgency, especially when describing operational problems and solutions.

**Speak the Language** 

Industry-specific terms like "cost per metre" and "rig performance" build credibility and trust. Start with the reader's pain points – minimising downtime, improving data accuracy, etc. – and then present solutions.
