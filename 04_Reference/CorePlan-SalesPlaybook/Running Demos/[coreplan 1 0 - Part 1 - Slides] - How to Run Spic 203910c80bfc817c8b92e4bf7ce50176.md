Running a demo whether it is the first time for a prospect or a subsequent demo with new stakeholders requires tact to ensure your prospect is set up for success in their education process.

This is a huge opportunity to understand their problems and getting a firm grasp of their world so that you can paint a picture of how CorePlan will solve the most critical problems.

<aside>
✅ Balance the demo with disco questions littered throughout the presentation to keep the customer engaged.

</aside>

<aside>
✅ Give them indication of pricing if asked on main plans based on website.

</aside>

<aside>
🚫 Offer to give them a quote without getting and confirming SPICED with all DMs

</aside>

<aside>
🚫 Grill them with questions in one burst while stuck in one place.

</aside>

<aside>
🚫 Talk at them without understanding the problem they’re trying to solve.

</aside>

Running these demos are both a science and an art and over the last 3 years we have near perfected the delivery. We are looking to achieve the following outcomes:

<aside>
💡 Understand their SPICE (d)

</aside>

<aside>
💡 If problem unaware, help them understand the problem.

</aside>

<aside>
💡 Confirm their NEED

</aside>

<aside>
💡 Identify the key stakeholders in the process

</aside>

<aside>
💡 Update [Flowla](https://www.flowla.com/)

</aside>

<aside>
💡 Gather sufficient information to formulate a **BUSINESS CASE** (if attendees are not decision makers)

</aside>

# Business Case

### What is it?

It's a tailored presentation or document to help prospects prepare an internal proposal for decision-makers. This document outlines the prospect’s organisation’s SPICED and shows how CorePlan can add value. It highlights the current situation, the problem, its impact, and the negative consequences if not addressed by a specific deadline. Then, it presents how CorePlan can solve these issues and help decision-makers achieve their success metrics.

### Why?

When you discover that the person(s) you’re demoing to aren't the decision-makers, our mission is to empower them to sell CorePlan to their team. By preparing this presentation, we save them time and control the narrative, showcasing CorePlan in the best possible light. Not every prospect you sell to will need a Business Case.

# **Disco and Preso**

<aside>
⚠️ Before running the demo it is Critical that you prepare. Understand who is attending, ensure contacts are added into hubspot, linkedin accounts populated.

</aside>

Introductions

- Introduce yourself, any coreplan team members.
- Ask prospect’s team to introduce themselves and their roles.
- Ask them how they heard about CorePlan if you don’t know
- Confirm your notes based on initial calls or history
- Explain that the meeting will be giving them a background of what CorePlan is about and how we can help them

**Disco and Setting the Scene**

During this stage you are giving the prospect to settle in to the call. You are also using this time to understand their SPICED, the key problems so you can showcase the relevant parts of the demo.  

Each slide has a specific job to do and you can navigate them as you see fit based on your understanding of the customer. You don’t need to talk through all the slides except the KEY ones.

During the call there will be KEY questions you will need to ask to 1) understand their problems and also 2) make them say things themselves so the penny drops.
