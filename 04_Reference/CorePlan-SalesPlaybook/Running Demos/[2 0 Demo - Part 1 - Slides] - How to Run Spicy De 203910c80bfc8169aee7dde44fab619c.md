**Disco and Setting the Scene**

During this stage you are giving the prospect to settle in to the call. Introductions

- Casual Banter first
- Introduce yourself, any coreplan team members.
- Ask prospect’s team to introduce themselves and their roles.
- Ask them how they heard about CorePlan if you don’t know
- Confirm your notes based on initial calls or history

---

Each slide has a specific job to do and you can navigate them as you see fit based on your understanding of the customer. You don’t need to talk through all the slides except the KEY ones.

During the call there will be KEY questions you will need to ask to 1) understand their problems and also 2) make them say things themselves so the penny drops.

Slide 1 [mandatory]

![Untitled](%5B2%200%20Demo%20-%20Part%201%20-%20Slides%5D%20-%20How%20to%20Run%20Spicy%20De/Untitled.png)

Start with:

- Can you see the Emu?
- **QUESTION:** Based on our previous conversations, you mentioned [specific drilling challenge or goal]. We'll definitely cover that today, but I'm curious – since we last spoke, what specific aspects of your drilling program management were you hoping to see addressed?
- Introduce CorePlan is a Drilling Operations Platform used by Drilling Contractors for revenue and client management. Used by Mining companies for Drill Program Management.
- Operates in Exploration, and Production environments across all types and stages of drilling.
- **QUESTION:** So that I can get an understanding of where to focus on, can you tell me a little bit about how you’re currently running your drilling operations?

Key Talk Track:

- What you’re going to see today is specifically designed for drilling operations and very different to what the drilling contractors use

Slide 2 [mandatory]

![Untitled](%5B2%200%20Demo%20-%20Part%201%20-%20Slides%5D%20-%20How%20to%20Run%20Spicy%20De/Untitled%201.png)

Talk Track:

- Most people from site, data teams or execs, come to us because they’re spending a lot of time doing low level tasks during their drilling operations management.
- Frankly speaking a lot of the time they’re wasting days trying to get simple information. The other day [Relatable story to prospects]
    - an exploration maanger from a tier 1 miner said they spent 3 days trying to get penetration rates instead of just clicking a button to get this data
    - A database manager said they had to go and reimport all the data into acquire because the scripts had broken

Slide 3 [Optional]

![Untitled](%5B2%200%20Demo%20-%20Part%201%20-%20Slides%5D%20-%20How%20to%20Run%20Spicy%20De/Untitled%202.png)

Talk Track:

- And its not just those, there are a lot of day to day frustrations that occur that grind gears and people
- Spending time instead of mental strengths on fact finding missions instead of the impact they are supposed to take the project along or develop their capabilities for growth.

Slide 4 [Mandatory]

![Untitled](%5B2%200%20Demo%20-%20Part%201%20-%20Slides%5D%20-%20How%20to%20Run%20Spicy%20De/Untitled%203.png)

 

Talk Track:

- So why is this happening?
- With over 100 companies that use CorePlan now we see the same pattern
- Spreadsheets, Custom Solutions, Traditional Software - regardless of which they may have worked in the past but:
    - isn’t fit to tackle the expensive and complex workflows today
    - might seem low or no cost but the impacts are unknown, and if *so it’s too late and you cant change the past*
    - Pushing data into custom solutions or geological databases are not deisgned for realtime drilling operations.

Slide 5 [Impact Slide]

![Untitled](%5B2%200%20Demo%20-%20Part%201%20-%20Slides%5D%20-%20How%20to%20Run%20Spicy%20De/Untitled%204.png)

Talk Track:

- Most site teams say while they can answer questions like reason for high coreloss or reasons for costs blowouts it takes days if not weeks.
- as most reporting may be done monthly it’s too late to catch what’s happenning
- Drilling optimisation, cost management, contractor performance visibility are hard
- And understanding what’s happening right now is a key challenge.

Questions (one or a couple, depending on engagement)

- What drilling metrics are most important to you?
- What are the common questions you’re having to answer?
- what are the key insights you need?

- Bring together all your drilling and logistics data to steamline data ops
- Automate analytics and reporting
- Break down silos and Connect teams

Slide 8 [Mandatory - Most Important Slide]

<aside>
⚠️ This is a KEY slide. Use this slide to engage the prospects to get a better understanding of their workflow. Make sure you are letting them talk and hear them out.

</aside>

![Untitled](%5B2%200%20Demo%20-%20Part%201%20-%20Slides%5D%20-%20How%20to%20Run%20Spicy%20De/Untitled%207.png)

Talk Track:

- When we say drill programs what we mean is this part of the workflow
- Where modelling and design tools like Leapfrog, Micromine, ArcGis etc end.. CorePlan Begins
- Bring in your drill holes, attach them to a drill program with budgets and start execution.
- Manage the lifecycle of the drill hole, activities and costs as it goes through the different stages while getting realtime reporting both during and at the end.
- And then sync the data into your geological database.

Questions:

- What modelling/drill design tool are you using? Leapfrog, micromine etc?
- And the geological database?
- Great - As you can see we cover quite a bit of the workflow. At the start you said X. Now that you’re seeing this what part of the workflow do you think is the most challenging for you.
- Ask questions to dig deeper into 1) how they do it if you don’t understand 2) why it is challenging 3) the impact of it
- !They might have already verbalised it so listen carefully and read between the lines and clarify. Use phrases like “So what I’m hearing is”

<aside>
☝ This slide can get long so make sure you’re reading the room and progress and ask some of these questions later down the track.
