Running a demo whether it is the first time for a prospect or a subsequent demo with new stakeholders requires tact to ensure your prospect is set up for success in their education process.

This is a huge opportunity to understand their problems and getting a firm grasp of their world so that you can paint a picture of how CorePlan will solve the most critical problems.

✅ Balance the demo with disco questions littered throughout the presentation to keep the customer engaged.

✅ Give them indication of pricing if asked on main plans based on website.

🚫 Offer to give them a quote without getting and confirming SPICED with all DMs

🚫 Grill them with questions in one burst while stuck in one place.

<aside>
🚫 Talk at them without understanding the problem they’re trying to solve.

Running these demos are both a science and an art and over the last 3 years we have near perfected the delivery. We are looking to achieve the following outcomes:

- Understand their SPICE (d)
- If problem unaware, help them understand the problem.
- Confirm their NEED
- Identify the key stakeholders in the process
- Book the second demo

# Platform Runtrough

⚠️ Your prospect has not seen the platform before, at all. And on top of that they’re probably not technology savvy. So it is important you 1) read the room and identify the pace 2) walk through the platform with gentle care, moving slowly and explaining things as you go and checking for understanding.

1. Showcase the project page walk through from top to bottom
2. Runthrough of the drill hole data model (depending on audeince)
