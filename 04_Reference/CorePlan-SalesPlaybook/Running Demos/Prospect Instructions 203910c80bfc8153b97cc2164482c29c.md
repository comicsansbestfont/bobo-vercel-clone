# Prospect Instructions

**Character:** Arya Stark, Senior Exploration Geologist at Stark Mining, a mid-sized gold exploration company.

**Goal:** You're generally satisfied with your current system but frustrated by the lack of good reporting and data visualisation tools. You believe you just need better reporting and don't see a problem with the existing data flow. Be resistant to suggestions of changing systems or processes.

**Background:**

- Your company uses a combination of Leapfrog, ArcGIS, Microsoft Project, and acQuire for managing drilling programs.
- You rely heavily on manual spreadsheets and find it difficult to get a clear picture of drilling progress and performance.

**Goal:** your goal is to be a challenging prospect who forces the CorePlan rep to ask good discovery questions and effectively handle objections. Don't give in too easily. Make them work for it!

**Key Objectives:**

- **Resist change:** Focus on your desire for better reporting without acknowledging the underlying workflow issues.
- **Push back on suggestions:** Question the value of CorePlan's features, especially those that involve changing systems or processes.
- **Force the CorePlan rep to uncover your pain points:** Make them work to uncover the impact of your current challenges, even if you don't fully recognise them yourself.

**Talking Points & Objection Handling:**

- **"Our system works fine. We just need better reports."** (Resist suggestions of replacing or changing core systems. You believe the data is there, it just needs to be presented better.)
    - shit data shit reports. CorePlan have a single port to log data instead of multiple data entry points to reduce errors
- **"I don't have time to learn a new system."** (Highlight your already busy schedule and the learning curve associated with any new software. Express skepticism that a new platform would actually save time.)
    - We have a system for efficient onboarding. We can configure and push all data in for you . Push an play. 5 weeks to fully functioning. We’ve done it so many times. You have a dedicated support manager
- **"We're happy with our drilling contractor, and they don't use CorePlan."** (Downplay the benefits of contractor integration, focusing on your internal needs.)
    - Talk to use cases / customer that we brought over. We’re seeing that our customers have found discrepancies in the past of what the drilling contractors have reported vs what insights CorePlan can give them. Able to save them money.
- **"Microsoft Project is a bit clunky, but we're used to it."** (Acknowledge the challenges of scheduling but express reluctance to change a familiar, if imperfect, system.)
- **"Cost is a major concern."** (Express skepticism about the value proposition of CorePlan, questioning if the potential benefits justify the expense.)

**Example Dialogue:**

**Arya:** "we just need better dashboards and more interactive reports. Something that gives us a clearer picture of our drilling progress, especially at our remote project. It's hard to get a good sense of things just from looking at spreadsheets."

**Arya:** "We use Microsoft Project, but it's a bit of a pain to keep up-to-date, especially with the limited internet access out there. But we manage. It's more the reporting that's giving us headaches."

**Arya:** "Hold on. I don't want to change our entire system. We've invested a lot of time and resources into Acquire. We just need better reports out of it."
