Running a demo whether it is the first time for a prospect or a subsequent demo with new stakeholders requires tact to ensure your prospect is set up for success in their education process.

This is a huge opportunity to understand their problems and getting a firm grasp of their world so that you can paint a picture of how CorePlan will solve the most critical problems.

<aside>
✅ Balance the demo with disco questions littered throughout the presentation to keep the customer engaged.

</aside>

<aside>
✅ Give them indication of pricing if asked on main plans based on website.

</aside>

<aside>
🚫 Offer to give them a quote without getting and confirming SPICED with all DMs

</aside>

<aside>
🚫 Grill them with questions in one burst while stuck in one place.

</aside>

<aside>
🚫 Talk at them without understanding the problem they’re trying to solve.

</aside>

Running these demos are both a science and an art and over the last 3 years we have near perfected the delivery. We are looking to achieve the following outcomes:

- Understand their SPICE (d)
- If problem unaware, help them understand the problem.
- Confirm their NEED
- Identify the key stakeholders in the process
- Book the second demo

# **Disco and Preso**

<aside>
⚠️ Before running the demo it is Critical that you prepare. Understand who is attending, ensure contacts are added into hubspot, linkedin accounts populated using Surfe, ensure you have your notes reviewed.

</aside>

Introductions

- Introduce yourself, any coreplan team members.
- Ask prospect’s team to introduce themselves and their roles.
- Ask them how they heard about CorePlan if you don’t know
- Confirm your notes based on initial calls or history

**Disco and Setting the Scene**

During this stage you are giving the prospect to settle in to the call. You are also using this time to understand their SPICED, the key problems so you can showcase the relevant parts of the demo.  

Each slide has a specific job to do and you can navigate them as you see fit based on your understanding of the customer. You don’t need to talk through all the slides except the KEY ones.

During the call there will be KEY questions you will need to ask to 1) understand their problems and also 2) make them say things themselves so the penny drops.

<aside>
⚠️ This is a KEY slide. Use this slide to engage the prospects to get a better understanding of their workflow. Make sure you are letting them talk and hear them out.

</aside>

Talk Track:

- When we say drill programs what we mean is this part of the workflow
- Where modelling and design tools like Leapfrog, Micromine, ArcGis etc end.. CorePlan Begins
- Bring in your drill holes, attach them to a drill program with budgets and start execution.
- Manage the lifecycle of the drill hole, activities and costs as it goes through the different stages while getting realtime reporting both during and at the end.
- And then sync the data into your geological database.

Questions:

- What modelling/drill design tool are you using? Leapfrog, micromine etc?
- And the geological database?
- Great - As you can see we cover quite a bit of the workflow. At the start you said X. Now that you’re seeing this what part of the workflow do you think is the most challenging for you.
- Ask questions to dig deeper into 1) how they do it if you don’t understand 2) why it is challenging 3) the impact of it
- !They might have already verbalised it so listen carefully and read between the lines and clarify. Use phrases like “So what I’m hearing is”

<aside>
☝ This slide can get long in the tooth so make sure you’re reading the room and progress and ask some of these questions later down the track.
