## What Are Sachee-isms?

These are the mental models, operating principles, and hard-won lessons that run through everything I build - from GTM frameworks to sales playbooks to content strategy. They're opinionated, contrarian in places, and battle-tested across dozens of B2B SaaS engagements.

**Where they show up:**
- Advisory sessions with founders (diagnostic and planning conversations)
- GTM Strategy Workbook (integrated throughout all 4 parts)
- Content development (blog posts, LinkedIn thought leadership)
- Sales and CS playbooks (SPICED framework, presales methodology)
- Product strategy decisions (lovability pyramid, roadmap prioritization)

**How to use them:**
- Reference when explaining "why we do things this way"
- Use as lenses for evaluating decisions and trade-offs
- Integrate into client deliverables and workshop materials
- Build content around individual principles (each could be a blog post)

## The Core Philosophy: The "Lovable" Framework

> **Lovable means that when people interact with the company, they love the experience—even before looking at the product. And this love directly drives revenue growth.**

### What "Lovable" Encompasses

Lovable is not just a feel-good concept. It's a revenue growth strategy that touches every dimension of the business and maps directly to the customer lifecycle (AARRR framework).

**1. Pre-Sales & Marketing Experience**

**Lovable means:**
- **Website & Copy:** When prospects visit our website, the way we talk to them through our copy makes them feel understood and excited
- **Resource Discovery:** The first interaction to find the resources they need—or even purchase the product is seamless and intuitive
- **Thought Leadership:** We provide the leadership, guidance, and knowledge they're looking for and deserve
- **Constructive Challenge:** We contest and challenge their assumptions to help them do better (not just validate what they already believe)

**Revenue Impact:** Attracts prospects to come to us (Acquisition)

**2. Sales Process**

**Lovable means:**
- **Educated Buying:** Prospects aren't getting "sold to"—they're making educated purchasing decisions through a guided process
- **Advocate Before Using:** Customers are able to advocate and champion the brand, product, and problem we solve **even before they start using it**
- **Trust Building:** The sales process builds genuine trust, not manipulative urgency

**Revenue Impact:** Makes it easy for prospects to choose us because of customer advocacy (Activation)

**3. Product Experience**

**Lovable means:**
- **Built For Them:** The product feels so seamless and easy to use because it feels like it was built specifically for them
- **Intuitive Design:** Users don't need extensive training—the UX is self-evident and delightful
- **Sense of Belonging:** When they use the product, they feel a sense of belonging and ownership

**Revenue Impact:** Great retention through architected customer journey (Retention)

**4. Customer Success & Advocacy**

**Lovable means:**
- **Champions in Action:** Customers champion the product while they're using it because they're getting real value
- **Active Advocates:** They advocate for the product to peers, colleagues, and their network
- **Community:** They feel connected to other users and the company itself

**Revenue Impact:** 
- Retention (customers stay because they're successful)
- Expansion (they continuously expand and use more products/services)
- Referral (customers actively advocate and refer others)

**5. Internal Culture (Employees)**

**Lovable applies internally, not just externally:**
- **Unusual Passion:** Employees are unusually passionate about the company's success and what they do for customers
- **Above & Beyond:** Staff go above and beyond in their roles
- **External Interactions:** The way staff interact with people outside the company reflects the "lovable" brand
- **Ownership Mindset:** Employees act like owners, not just executors

**Revenue Impact:** Better customer experiences across all touchpoints drive retention and advocacy

**6. Company Operations**

**Lovable extends to every function:**
- **HR & Talent Acquisition:** The hiring experience is exceptional—candidates love the process even if they don't get the job
- **Investor Relations:** Investors feel excited, informed, and aligned with the mission
- **Partners & Vendors:** Even our suppliers enjoy working with us

**Revenue Impact:** Attracts top talent, capital, and strategic partnerships that fuel growth

**7. Brand Personality**

**Lovable means:**
- **Fun & Playful:** We don't take ourselves too seriously
- **Serious Execution:** But we do everything super seriously and are really good at it
- **Authentic:** We're relatable, real, and human

**Revenue Impact:** Differentiation in crowded markets; memorable brand that people want to work with

### How "Lovable" Maps to Revenue Growth (AARRR Framework)

| AARRR Stage | How "Lovable" Drives It |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Acquisition** | Prospects are attracted to us through thought leadership, relatable copy, and customer advocacy |
| **Activation** | Easy buying process, educated decision-making, customer advocacy makes the choice obvious |
| **Retention** | Architected customer journey, product feels built for them, sense of belonging |
| **Revenue (Expansion)** | Customers continuously expand usage because they're successful and love the experience |
| **Referral** | Customers actively advocate and refer because they're champions of the brand |

## The 13 Core Sachee-isms

### 1. "Speed is our weapon"

**Principle:** Early-stage startups can't out-resource incumbents. But we can move faster. Speed in outreach, speed in demos, speed to value. That's how we win.

**Why it matters:**
- Incumbents are slow, bureaucratic, and can't pivot quickly
- Your advantage is weeks and days, not months and quarters
- Speed compounds: faster learning → faster iteration → faster growth

**Where it applies:**
- **Sales:** 24-hour response times, same-day demo scheduling, rapid proposal turnaround
- **Product:** Ship MVPs fast, iterate based on customer feedback, don't over-engineer
- **Onboarding:** Get customers to first value in days, not weeks
- **Content:** Weekly publishing cadence beats monthly perfection

**Example:**
CorePlan could run a desktop study in 3 days when competitors needed 6 weeks for pilot planning. That speed closed deals.

**Red flags (violating this principle):**
- "Let's wait until Q2 to launch that"
- "We need 3 more rounds of review before we ship"
- "The competitor took 6 weeks, so we should too"

---

### 2. "Always solve for the customer"

**Principle:** When in doubt, ask: What's best for the customer? Not what's easiest for us, not what looks good on a board deck. What actually helps them win?

**Why it matters:**
- Customer outcomes drive retention and referrals
- Short-term shortcuts create long-term churn
- Solving for the customer builds trust, which is your real moat

**Where it applies:**
- **Sales:** Qualify out bad-fit customers even if they want to buy
- **Product:** Build what they need, not what's technically interesting
- **Pricing:** Structure deals that align incentives, not just maximize ACV
- **CS:** White-glove support early on, even if it doesn't scale

**Example:**
At CorePlan, we walked away from a $200K deal because the customer's data quality wasn't good enough for our tool to deliver value. They appreciated the honesty and came back 6 months later when they were ready.

**Red flags:**
- "They'll figure it out after they buy"
- "We need to hit this quarter's target, so let's close any deal"
- "That feature request doesn't fit our roadmap, ignore it"

---

### 3. "Meet the customer where they're at"

**Principle:** Don't assume they know SaaS, don't assume they self-learn. Meet them in their world, speak their language, hold their hand until they're self-sufficient. Customers don't self-learn - we have to guide them.

**Why it matters:**
- Most buyers in vertical/enterprise SaaS are NOT tech-native
- Onboarding friction kills activation and drives churn
- Hand-holding early on creates champions later

**Where it applies:**
- **Sales:** Use their terminology, not yours. "Cost reconciliation" not "data normalization."
- **Demos:** Show their workflows, not your features
- **Onboarding:** Walk them through step-by-step, don't just send a knowledge base link
- **Support:** Over-communicate during first 90 days

**Example:**
Mining customers don't talk about "APIs" or "webhooks" - they talk about "site reconciliation" and "drill and blast reports." Speak their language or lose the deal.

**Red flags:**
- "They should read the documentation"
- "This is self-serve, they'll figure it out"
- "We explained this once, why are they asking again?"

---

### 4. "When they zig, we zag"

**Principle:** If everyone's building everything, we build one thing well. If everyone's chasing scale, we go deep on a niche. Contrarian positioning wins.

**Why it matters:**
- Head-to-head competition with well-funded incumbents is a losing battle
- Niches have less competition and higher willingness to pay
- Differentiation creates pricing power

**Where it applies:**
- **ICP selection:** Pick the segment others ignore (too small, too complex, too niche)
- **Product strategy:** Build deep vertical functionality, not horizontal breadth
- **Content:** Write about contrarian takes, not consensus opinions
- **Sales:** Focus on accounts incumbents don't serve well

**Example:**
When everyone was building "construction management software," CorePlan went deep on mining and heavy industrial. Smaller market, but we owned it.

**Red flags:**
- "Let's build for everyone"
- "Our competitor just launched this feature, we need it too"
- "We should target the same ICP as [big competitor]"

---

### 5. "Save the cheerleader, save the world"

**Principle:** Win a tight beachhead segment, then use them as your wedge into the bigger market. Focus on drilling contractors and solve for them completely, then use that credibility and product depth to crack the broader mining market. Don't try to serve everyone at once. Pick the cheerleader niche that unlocks the world you actually want.

**Why it matters:**
- Spreading thin across segments means you win nowhere
- Deep credibility in one niche creates leverage into adjacent markets
- Case studies and references from beachhead unlock the rest

**Where it applies:**
- **ICP definition:** Phase 1a/1b requires tight beachhead focus (drilling contractors, not "all of mining")
- **Product roadmap:** Build deep for the beachhead before expanding horizontally
- **Sales:** Close 10-30 customers in the cheerleader niche before moving to the next segment
- **Content:** Thought leadership for the beachhead builds broader awareness

**Example:**
*Heroes* reference, but the strategy is real:
- **Cheerleader niche:** Drilling contractors (small, urgent problem, underserved)
- **The world:** Broader mining market (larger TAM, more complex, longer sales cycles)
- **The wedge:** "We're the drilling contractor experts" → "We understand mining workflows" → "We're the mining industry platform"

**How to identify your cheerleader:**
- Who has the most urgent pain?
- Who is most underserved by current tools?
- Who will become vocal advocates if you solve their problem?
- Who unlocks credibility in the broader market?

**Red flags:**
- "We serve all mining customers"
- "Let's launch in 5 verticals at once"
- "We need to be horizontal to scale"

---

### 6. "How do we build an elephant? One bite at a time."

**Principle:** Big goals, small steps. Break down every complex problem into the smallest actionable piece. First principles thinking. Avoid burnout by not switching topics AND depth at the same time.

**Why it matters:**
- Big goals are paralyzing without clear next steps
- Small wins create momentum and learning
- Switching context costs time and mental energy

**Where it applies:**
- **Project planning:** Break "Build GTM engine" into 13 specific elements with clear deliverables
- **Content development:** "Write about PMF" → "Write 3-part series: definition, stages, diagnostics"
- **Sales:** "Close enterprise deals" → "Book 5 discovery calls this week"
- **Advisory:** "Fix their GTM" → "Diagnose phase, pick 3 weak spots, build deliverables for those"

**Example:**
The GTM Strategy Workbook didn't start as a 4-part, 70-page document. It started as "What are the 5 questions Phase 1a founders need to answer?" Then we added Phase 1b. Then we added execution elements. One bite at a time.

**Red flags:**
- "We need to fix everything at once"
- "Let's completely rebuild the GTM motion this quarter"
- Starting 5 new initiatives simultaneously

---

### 7. "Lead, don't take orders"

**Principle:** Consultative sales means challenging the customer, setting expectations, educating them. Don't be an order-taker. Be a trusted advisor. Help the buyer, educate, inform, and challenge where necessary.

**Why it matters:**
- Customers hire you because you're the expert
- Order-takers compete on price, advisors command premium pricing
- Leading the conversation builds trust and credibility

**Where it applies:**
- **Discovery:** Ask hard questions about their current process and why it's failing
- **Demos:** Don't just show what they asked for - show what they actually need
- **Proposals:** Recommend the right solution, even if it's smaller than what they asked for
- **Objection handling:** Challenge faulty assumptions instead of just saying "yes"

**Example:**
Customer says: "We need a 6-month pilot to test this."
Order-taker response: "Sure, we can do a 6-month pilot."
Consultative response: "Help me understand why 6 months. What would you learn in month 6 that you wouldn't know in month 2? Let's define clear success criteria and the shortest path to validate them."

**Red flags:**
- "Whatever the customer wants"
- "We'll build any custom feature they ask for"
- "Let's not push back, just close the deal"

---

### 8. "We can do until someone shows us we can't"

**Principle:** Default to "yes" and figure it out. Most "impossible" problems are just hard. And hard problems get solved by people who don't know they're supposed to be impossible.

**Why it matters:**
- Bias toward action beats analysis paralysis
- Innovation happens at the edges of what's possible
- Saying "no" too quickly kills momentum

**Where it applies:**
- **Sales:** "Can you integrate with [obscure system]?" → "Let me research that and get back to you" (don't say no immediately)
- **Product:** "Can we support this workflow?" → Try it before deciding it's impossible
- **Advisory:** "Can we close 10 customers in 90 days?" → Build the plan before saying it's unrealistic
- **Content:** "Can we publish 3x/week?" → Test it before deciding it's too much

**Balance:** This doesn't mean say "yes" to bad-fit customers or scope-creep features. It means don't default to "no" reflexively.

**Example:**
CorePlan's desktop study methodology didn't exist when we started. A customer asked "Can you show us how this works with our actual data?" We said "Yes" and figured out how to build it. That became our wedge.

**Red flags:**
- "That's not possible"
- "We've never done that before, so we can't"
- "Let's not even try"

---

### 9. "Stupidly obvious + highly detailed"

**Principle:** Content (and messaging) needs to be both dead simple AND deeply specific. Vague thought leadership loses credibility. Specific examples build trust. Be specific about their problem, the impact, and the solution.

**Why it matters:**
- Readers skim - if it's not immediately clear, they bounce
- Specificity signals expertise
- Generic advice is forgettable, specific advice is actionable

**Where it applies:**
- **Blog posts:** Don't write "improve your sales process" → Write "How to run a 30-minute discovery call using SPICED (with 15 sample questions)"
- **Value props:** Don't say "save time" → Say "reduce cost reconciliation from 3 days to 3 hours per site per month"
- **Case studies:** Don't say "increased efficiency" → Say "reduced manual data entry by 40 hours per month per site, saving $80K annually"
- **LinkedIn posts:** Don't write "leadership lessons" → Write "The 3-minute standup format I used at CorePlan (with exact script)"

**Framework:**
1. **Stupidly obvious headline:** Exactly what this is about, no clever wordplay
2. **Highly detailed body:** Step-by-step, with examples, numbers, and templates

**Example (good):**
- **Title:** "How to Build a Dream 100 List for Founder-Led Outbound (3-Step Process)"
- **Body:** "Step 1: Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator filters: Industry = Mining, Title = Operations Manager, Company Size = 50-500..."

**Example (bad):**
- **Title:** "The Secret to Better Prospecting"
- **Body:** "Focus on quality over quantity. Target the right people. Be authentic."

**Red flags:**
- "Let's keep it high-level"
- "We don't want to give away too much"
- Generic advice that could apply to any company in any industry

---

### 10. "We usually get one attempt at winning. So let's make it count."

**Principle:** In concentrated markets (enterprise, vertical SaaS, heavy industry), you don't get second chances. Every interaction matters. No spray and pray.

**Why it matters:**
- Vertical markets are small - burn one account and word spreads
- Enterprise buying committees talk to each other
- Your reputation precedes you (good or bad)

**Where it applies:**
- **Outbound:** Personalized, researched outreach for every account
- **Demos:** Prep thoroughly, show their workflows, know their business
- **Sales process:** Don't rush - if you lose on price or fit, you can't come back in 6 months
- **Customer success:** First impression in onboarding sets the tone for the relationship

**Example:**
In Australian mining, there are ~50 major operators. If you blow 5 demos because you weren't prepared, that's 10% of your TAM gone. Word travels fast in tight industries.

**Red flags:**
- Mass cold email blasts with no personalization
- "Let's just get the demo booked, we'll figure out their needs on the call"
- "If they churn, there are plenty of other customers"

---

### 11. "The right experience at the right place at the right time, for the customer."

**Principle:** This is the integration principle. Marketing, sales, product, CS, support - they all have to orchestrate around the customer journey. No silos.

**Why it matters:**
- Siloed functions create broken customer experiences
- Handoffs are where deals and customers die
- The customer doesn't care about your org chart

**Where it applies:**
- **Marketing → Sales handoff:** Marketing qualifies leads properly, sales follows up fast
- **Sales → CS handoff:** Detailed context transfer, success criteria documented
- **Product → Sales alignment:** Roadmap informed by sales feedback, not built in isolation
- **CS → Product feedback loop:** Usage data and churn drivers inform product decisions

**Example:**
Bad experience: Customer sees "Book a Demo" CTA, fills out form, gets auto-response "Someone will reach out in 3-5 days," hears nothing for a week.

Good experience: Customer fills out form → SDR texts within 2 hours → Demo scheduled same day → AE has reviewed their LinkedIn and company before the call → CS gets intro'd on the demo call → Onboarding starts day 1 after close.

**Red flags:**
- "That's marketing's problem, not mine"
- "Sales never gives us context on new customers"
- "Product doesn't listen to customer feedback"

---

### 12. "Do things that don't scale"

**Principle:** For your first 10-30 customers, forget scalability. Manual outreach, personalized demos, white-glove onboarding. Scalable comes later. Learn first, then systematize.

**Why it matters:**
- Scaling a broken process just breaks faster
- Early customers teach you what actually works
- Unscalable tactics create fanatical early adopters

**Where it applies:**
- **Outbound:** Hand-written emails to 20 target accounts beats automated sequences to 500
- **Demos:** Custom demo environments with their data beats generic feature tours
- **Onboarding:** Walk them through setup vs "here's the knowledge base"
- **Support:** Founder texts/calls vs ticketing system

**Phase-specific:**
- **Phase 1a/1b:** Everything should be unscalable. You're learning, not scaling.
- **Phase 2:** Start systematizing what worked. Build light playbooks.
- **Phase 3:** Now you can scale. Automation, processes, team expansion.

**Example:**
Paul Graham's famous essay on this. Airbnb founders went door-to-door to photograph listings. Didn't scale. But it taught them what mattered and built their first champions.

**Red flags:**
- "We need to automate this before we launch"
- "How will this work when we have 1000 customers?" (when you have 3)
- Building tools and processes before you have 10 customers using them

---

### 13. "People buy from people, not logos"

**Principle:** Founder-led content and personal brand beats company page posts 10:1. Build your LinkedIn presence before you build demand gen campaigns.

**Why it matters:**
- Early-stage companies have no brand
- People trust people, not faceless companies
- Founder storytelling builds trust at scale before you have customers or proof

**Where it applies:**
- **LinkedIn:** Founder posts 2-4x/week beats company page posts
- **Outbound:** "I'm the founder and here's why I built this" beats "We're a company that does X"
- **Sales calls:** Lead with personal story and "why I care about this problem"
- **Content:** Write from the founder's voice, not the corporate voice

**What to share:**
- Lessons from customer conversations
- Mistakes you've made and what you learned
- Why you're solving this problem (personal connection)
- Behind-the-scenes of building the company
- Contrarian takes on the industry

**Example:**
Sachee's LinkedIn posts about "Speed is our weapon" or "Save the cheerleader, save the world" get more engagement and inbound than any company page ever could.

**Red flags:**
- "We need a social media manager to post for us"
- "Let's only post company updates and product launches"
- "I'm too busy to post on LinkedIn"

---

## How to Use Sachee-isms in Your Work

### For Strategy Development
- **Diagnostic questions:** "Are you violating any of these principles?"
- **Planning decisions:** "Which principle applies here?"
- **Prioritization:** "What moves us closer to these principles vs further away?"

### For Content Creation
- Each principle is a blog post, LinkedIn thread, or newsletter
- Use principles as frameworks for case studies
- Reference them in thought leadership to reinforce positioning

### For Advisory Sessions
- Explain "why" decisions using these principles
- Use them to challenge founders' assumptions
- Help founders internalize them as their own operating system

### For Sales and CS
- Use in discovery to understand if customer aligns with our approach
- Reference in proposals to explain our methodology
- Use in onboarding to set expectations for how we work

---

## Expanding the List

These 13 principles are the core, but there are more emerging:
- **"Revenue fixes everything"** - Focus on getting customers first, then scale operations
- **"Build the plane while flying it"** - Don't wait for perfection, iterate in market
- **"Strong opinions, loosely held"** - Have a POV but be willing to change with data
- **"If it's not documented, it doesn't exist"** - Systems thinking requires writing things down

Add new principles as they crystallize through client work and experience.
