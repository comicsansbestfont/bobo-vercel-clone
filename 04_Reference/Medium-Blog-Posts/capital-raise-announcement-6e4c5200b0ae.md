# 📣 Capital Raise Announcement



![Image 1](images/post2_image_1.jpg)



We have just finalised the raise of our very first funding round bringing in a
ripper $4 million to the CorePlan table. EVP, a leader in B2B SaaS investments
joins our investor committee alongside Red Terra Investments.

2023 has been wild — and the year isn’t over yet. This year we’ve grown the
team to 28, our customer count to 80, and we now house over 10 million drilled
meters on the platform. Oh, I also spotted my first grey hairs! (But who’s
counting) 👨🏽‍🦳

This wad of capital enables us to not only fulfill our commitments to the
industry but to exceed them, advancing our mission to help people in mining
work better together in the modern age. These funds will focus on product
development, expanding and enhancing the capabilities and experience of our
current products. We are also excited to take CorePlan globally to serve
demands from the Americas as well as the AME regions. Watch this space.

Alex Goulios and I have been juggling a zillion things this year on top of the
raise, Kim Wong and Eugene Lee have been in the engine room making it all
happen to deliver an industry leading platform. Shout out to the entire
CorePlan team and all our customers for their extreme support and ultra
passion to the company and the mining industry.

Mark Velik, Allen Zhu and the team at EVP, big hugs, fist bumps and warm
welcomes to CorePlan. Super excited for our journey together. 🚀
