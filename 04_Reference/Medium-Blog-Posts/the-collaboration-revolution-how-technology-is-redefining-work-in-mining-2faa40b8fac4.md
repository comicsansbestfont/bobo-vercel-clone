# **The Collaboration Revolution:** How Technology is Redefining Work in Mining

Back in the day, the internet was pretty different from what it is now.
Remember Netscape and Yahoo?

That was the era of Web 1.0, where people could only consume content on the
internet without any meaningful interaction. It was mostly a one-way street,
and users lacked the ability to generate their own dynamic content. Basically,
it was a top-down system.

But then, the internet went through a huge transformation in the 2010s with
the rise of Web 2.0. Social media platforms like Myspace and Facebook took
center stage, and the introduction of smartphones, CRMs like Salesforce and
Google Apps all paved the way for real-time collaboration and content
creation. Suddenly, the internet became more interactive, dynamic, and
engaging.

This shift from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 has revolutionized the way people work by
allowing for greater collaboration and communication. The internet has become
an essential part of our daily lives, from work to entertainment, education to
social interaction.

In fact, the internet has taken over as the main platform for the modern-day
workplace, replacing the traditional physical office. It’s crazy how far we’ve
come!

## From Unconnected to Connected

Back in March 2020, when the pandemic hit, lots of people were skeptical about
using programs like Microsoft Teams or Zoom. They were cool, but not really
necessary. But when remote work became the norm, these tools went from being
extras to essentials. Suddenly, stuff like in-person meetings or site visits
were a thing of the past, and businesses had to rely on these tools to keep
things running.

The dawn of mainstream use of collaboration platforms

As a result, the use of collaboration tools shot up like crazy. According to
the IDC that did a whole lot of research into collaborative tools and the
layers of collaboration, in just six months, the number of people using these
tools across all industries grew by as much as it had in the previous five
years. That’s wild! It turned out that when people were forced to use these
tools, they realized how great they were. Teams could stay connected, projects
could keep moving, and people could keep being productive, even in tough
times.

Now, it’s interesting to think about how collaboration tools used to work. In
industries like mining, for example, people used Excel, OneDrive, SharePoint,
or some other on-prem system. But those tools weren’t great for sharing
information or working together. Collaboration was limited to whoever had
access to the same stuff.

But in recent years, there’s been a whole new generation of collaboration
tools. Tech startups were the first to jump on board, but even industries like
mining are starting to catch on. Tools like Miro, ClickUp, and Zoom have
revolutionized the way people work together. They let teams collaborate in
real time, whether they’re in the same room or on opposite sides of the world.
They break down silos and create a culture of collaboration.

The pandemic definitely sped up the adoption of these tools, but it also
showed us just how important collaboration is. As remote work becomes more and
more common, collaboration will be key to success. The ability to work
together, share ideas, and communicate effectively will be critical in a world
where the workplace is increasingly digital.

Leaders in all kinds of industries have figured this out and are building
their own “Collaboration Stacks” to make sure their people can work together
better than ever.‍

## So what is a Collaboration Tech Stack?

Let’s talk about collaboration tech stacks. But first, what is collaboration?
Simply put, it’s the way people work together to create value around shared
goals. And while it’s not a technology thing, technology has made
collaboration easier and more effective than ever before.

So what exactly is a collaboration tech stack? It’s a set of tools and
technologies that help people communicate, create and share content, stay
productive, and gain insights within an organization. But not all
collaboration stacks are created equal. For some, some people are still stuck
using Microsoft Excel, One Drive, and email. Others might have a more modern
cloud-based platform that seamlessly integrates different tools to improve
communication and productivity.

A good collaboration tech stack is essential for any digital workplace. It
helps teams work together more efficiently, leading to better productivity,
innovation, and engagement. By using the right set of tools, organizations can
break down silos and foster a culture of collaboration that ultimately drives
success.‍

## The 5 layers of Collaboration

So, when we talk about a digital collaboration stack, it basically means
having different layers of tools and technologies that work together to make
collaboration within an organization a breeze.

### Communications layer

This is where people can be people, you know, have conversations, attend
meetings, and even send short messages like they do outside of work. These
collaborative platforms allow everyone to stay in the loop and access
information in real-time, no matter where they are. It's like a modern digital
workspace that breaks down those pesky data and communication silos.

Now, let's take a look at how this applies in the mining industry,
specifically in the drill program workflow. Geologists, drilling contractors,
and other stakeholders need to communicate during the planning, execution, and
analysis of drilling programs.

In the past, things like drilling status updates, approval information, field
activity updates, sample locations, and general check-ins were typically done
on paper or in Excel, or even worse, on-prem systems with shared licenses that
made clear, real-time communication a challenge. But with a digital
collaboration stack, all of these communications can be done seamlessly,
helping everyone stay on the same page and work more efficiently.

‍

### Content layer

The Content Layer is where all the good stuff lives. It’s where you’ll find
all the files, documents, and media you need to get your work done. This layer
is where you can create, share, and manage all kinds of content, from data and
analytics to documents and presentations. And by connecting different tools
within this layer, you can make your work easier and more efficient. For
example, if you’re running a tech startup, you might integrate your CRM with
your Product analytics tools. Or if you’re in the mining industry, you might
integrate your drill program operations platform with your database. These
integrations allow you to move data between tools seamlessly, without having
to switch between different applications all the time.

In the mining industry, the Content Layer is especially important when it
comes to managing all the information generated during a drilling program.
You’ve got drill plods, assay results, geophysical surveys, and geological
reports, just to name a few. By using collaboration tools that integrate with
data management systems, geologists and other stakeholders can access and
manage this content more efficiently. This streamlines workflows and makes
collaboration more effective.

‍

### Productivity layer

The Productivity Layer is where the real magic happens. This layer brings
together the Communications and Content Layers with powerful integrations that
save time and resources, making work easier and more organized. This layer
offers a bunch of amazing tools like project management platforms such as
[ClickUp](http://www.clickup.com) drill program management software like
[CorePlan](https://www.coreplan.io/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=thought-
leadership&utm_content=the-collaboration-revolution), or geological databases
like MX Deposits as well as automation tools that take care of repetitive
tasks and give more time for important work. The best part is that all of
these tools work together seamlessly, ensuring that projects are completed
quickly and efficiently.

CorePlan's Drill Program lifecycle Workflow

In the drill program workflow, imagine how much more productive it would be to
not have to manually enter data into spreadsheets or make countless phone
calls to check on the status of holes and samples. With the right tools and
integrations, talented professionals can spend less time stuck in spreadsheets
and more time doing real work.

‍

### Insights layer

The Insights Layer is where things get really interesting. With improved
communication, easy access to content, and productivity enabled through
integration, your team can now measure the performance of their activities and
projects visually and in real-time. This opens up a whole new world of
possibilities and allows for better definitions of what success looks like.
You can track metrics and set targets, and adjust your approach as needed to
stay on track.

Analytics showcasing drill program metrics

In the context of a drill program workflow, the Insights Layer is essential
for monitoring and optimizing performance. With real-time visibility into the
drilling program, geologists and other stakeholders can track progress,
monitor drilling status, and view performance metrics such as drilling
efficiency, drill rates, and costs per meter. By using collaboration tools
that integrate with data analytics and visualization tools, you can access and
analyze this information more effectively, and make more informed decisions.
This layer helps you stay on top of things and take corrective actions when
needed to ensure success.

‍

### Community layer

The final piece of the puzzle is the Community Layer. What happens when you
break down barriers, increase transparency, empower productivity, and
communication? You get people working better together. You get communities of
teams focused on solving problems and achieving peak performance.

In the world of mineral exploration, the Community Layer can bring together
different teams and stakeholders involved in the drilling program —
geologists, drilling contractors, and management. By breaking down silos and
enabling collaboration across teams, the Community Layer can foster a culture
of shared goals and mutual support, where everyone is working together towards
a common objective.

Collaboration tools that enable community-building can connect individuals and
teams with similar interests, expertise, or roles. For example, a community of
geologists can be created where they can share knowledge, discuss best
practices, and collaborate on solutions to problems they face in the field.
Similarly, a community of drilling contractors can be established to improve
communication and coordination during the drilling program.

The Community Layer can also provide opportunities for learning and
development, where individuals can share their experiences, learn from others,
and build their skills. This can help create a culture of continuous
improvement, where everyone is encouraged to learn and grow.‍

## It’s time to leave the past in the past

If you’ve got this far into reading this you’re probably wanting to make
change in your organisation. They’re planning on putting 4G on the moon (lol
actual) but you’re still stuck there shackled to a bunch of spreadsheets and
some crappy software that crashes all the time.

Throwing all that out the window and putting together a well thought out stack
of tools that connect seamlessly with each other is only half the way. But it
is not the end all and its definitely not something that starts working
overnight. Why?

Because this transformation is a process and a journey. And it’s heavily
driven by culture. I might argue that the easy part IS putting the tech stack
together. The actual hard part is having people thinking “the old way” was
better.

I won’t keep adding more words to this post for the time being. I might add to
it or write a follow up in the coming months. But in the meantime – Thanks for
reading! Catch you next time.

Also psssstt… I’ve written this other thing about the [High Cost of Low Tech
in Mining](https://howdy.sachee.com.au/the-high-cost-of-low-tech-the-impact-
of-manual-operations-on-drill-programs-92dd571e5fbf) which you might want to
