# The Rise of the Digital Drill Contractor in Mineral Exploration

 _From Paper Plods to Digital Dominance_

In recent years, the mineral exploration industry has seen a huge shift as
drill contractors ditch traditional paper plods for digital systems. This
change has been fueled by the need for better data management, improved
accuracy, and enhanced collaboration among exploration teams.

Paper plods are becoming fossils in this digital age and today, choosing the
right drill contractor now means picking one with the digital forward thinking
mindset to deliver accurate and reliable data and costs.

## Why Drill Contractors are Going Digital Now

So, why are drill contractors jumping on the digital bandwagon? There are a
few good reasons:

**Technological advancements:** Cutting-edge tech has made digital systems
more accessible, reliable, and affordable than ever. Drill contractors are now
able to use these innovations to step up their game and offer clients better
services.

**Increased competition:** With the drilling industry getting more
competitive, contractors need to find ways to stand out. Adopting digital
systems lets them offer clients better accuracy, efficiency, and data
management, giving them a leg up on the competition.

**Demand for real-time data and analytics to optimise performance:** Mineral
exploration companies are all about real-time data and analytics these days.
Drill contractors who embrace digital systems can deliver this valuable info
faster and more efficiently, making them a top choice for clients.

**Environmental and social responsibility:** Going digital can help drill
contractors reduce their environmental impact by ditching paper-based
documentation and cutting down on waste. Plus, digital systems can improve
safety by streamlining communication and managing health and safety risks more
effectively.

**Regulatory compliance:** Staying on the right side of the law is crucial,
and digital systems make it easier to track and report compliance-related
info. This means less risk of fines or penalties for non-compliance.

By going digital, drill contractors are staying ahead of the curve, offering
top-notch services to clients, and staying competitive in a fast-paced market.

## Types of Digital Systems Adopted by Drill Contractors

The digital revolution in the drilling industry is as varied as the mineral
deposits we’re after. Drill contractors have adopted different digital
systems, each with its own perks. Let’s take a closer look at the three main
types of digital systems making waves in the drilling world.

  1. **Adoption of existing commercial solutions**

Many drill contractors have chosen to integrate established solutions that
were developed some time ago into their operations. These systems offer
features that help with data collection and management, keeping exploration
teams in the know about their drilling projects. But, these solutions might
not cover every specific need or nuance for each operation. These systems
might have been ground breaking at the time however haven’t kept up with the
demands of either running a drilling operations or requirements for
collaboration internally or with their clients.

**2\. Development of custom digital systems**

For some drill contractors, the limitations of existing solutions have pushed
them to create their own custom digital systems. These tailor-made solutions
cater to a contractor’s unique operational requirements, giving them a perfect
fit. But, custom systems can be resource-intensive to develop and maintain,
and they might lack the support or updates of more established platforms.

**3\. Transition to modern drilling SaaS platforms like CorePlan or Krux**

Say hello to the new kids on the block: modern drilling SaaS platforms like
CorePlan and Krux. These cloud-based solutions offer a comprehensive suite of
features designed for the modern digital drill contractor. With built-in data
validation, real-time data sharing, and analytics, these platforms are quickly
becoming the go-to choice for drill contractors looking to work smarter and
better serve their clients.

By partnering with a contractor using the right digital solution, you’ll make
sure your drilling projects run smoothly, efficiently, and accurately.

## What to expect when you’re expecting (to work with a digital drill
contractor)

When you choose a digital drill contractor, you’ll be digging into a treasure
trove of real-time data and streamlined processes. Going with a contractor
that uses a digital solution means you’ll get drilling data in a format that
helps you better understand your drill program.

### Efficient delivery of data through Excel formats

Digital drill contractors can quickly deliver drilling data in easy-to-use
formats like Excel. That means no more sorting through piles of paperwork or
trying to read messy handwriting. Instead, you get streamlined, organised data
that’s a breeze to analyse and share with your team.

### Faster data delivery compared to paper or manual Excel systems

Since drill contractors are probably using a mobile or tablet, data is
captured, processed, and delivered in near real-time. Your exploration team
can make well-informed decisions on the fly, and you can say goodbye to
waiting for paper plods or dealing with clunky spreadsheets.

### Improved data accuracy and validation in digital systems

Errors can really slow things down, but digital drill contractors have your
back. Most systems come with built-in validation tools that help make sure
drilling data is accurate and complete, cutting down on the risk of costly
mistakes.

### Positive impact on geologists and other team members’ time within the
mining company

By automating data capture and processing, your team gets more time to focus
on what they do best: interpreting data, planning, strategizing, and — most
importantly — DOING MORE GEOLOGY. Less time wrangling data means more time for
uncovering valuable insights and making data-driven decisions. #FreeTheGeos

### Enhanced data quality for resource modelling and estimation

With digital systems, you’ll collect top-notch data, which translates to more
accurate resource modelling and estimation. Better data leads to better
predictions and more informed decisions, giving your mining company a
competitive edge.

In a nutshell, choosing a digital drill contractor is like striking gold in
terms of efficiency, accuracy, and innovation. Embrace the digital revolution
and watch your mining company’s exploration efforts soar.

## Benefits of Selecting a Modern Drill Contractor VS others using General or
Custom Systems

The digital drilling world offers plenty of solutions, but not every system is
equally effective. Modern drill contractors using CorePlan or Krux, cutting-
edge drilling SaaS (software as a service) platform, stand out as the top
choice for exploration teams who want the best performance.

The following comparison highlights the issues with general or custom systems
and the advantages of modern drill contractors using CorePlan( I’d talk about
Krux but I don’t have any intel on this).

I’ll dive into the benefits for exploration teams for each point.

### Integrated governance and validation controls for accurate data recording

CorePlan drill contractors don’t just collect data; they refine it for optimal
accuracy. The platform’s built-in governance and validation controls ensure
drilling intervals, time activities, and downhole activities are recorded with
exceptional precision. In contrast, contractors using custom or general
digital systems might face issues with overlapping or missing intervals due to
weak internal validation.

### Comprehensive supervisor review for precise data sharing

Drilling Supervisors can examine submitted data on a shift-by-shift basis from
the field, promoting super accurate data sharing. This level of validation is
often missing in custom or general digital systems, which can lead to
discrepancies or delays in data delivery.

### Secure data delivery through the CorePlan Plod Portal

Your drill contractor will provide you with supervisor-approved data via
CorePlan’s Plod Portal — a secure environment for accessing your drilling
data. On the other hand, custom or general digital systems often rely on email
for data delivery, which is less secure and vulnerable to potential data
breaches.

### Streamlined review, approval, and resubmission process via the Plod Portal

The Plod Portal, exclusive to CorePlan, simplifies the review and approval
process or drilling data. With an intuitive interface, it’s easy for
exploration teams to request modifications or ask questions, ensuring you get
the most accurate data possible. Custom or general digital systems might lack
this level of communication and collaboration, leading to potential issues and
delays in the review process.

### Real-time access to daily drilling production and costs

CorePlan drill contractors offer real-time access to their daily drilling
activities, giving exploration teams a transparent view of progress and costs.
This level of detail is often missing in custom or general digital systems,
where cost might be only available after project completion, limiting your
ability to monitor expenses and make data-driven decisions.
