Current Situation 
Everyday, the Hemi & Regional teams run their operations by:  
● Planning & referencing multiple spreadsheets  
○ plods, budgets, pricings, active holes, planned holes, and more…  
To get visibility into drill metrics, the team needs to:  
● Spend hours wrangling data to create reports 
● Request data from expedio and wait for report to be created 
With more drilling upcoming in 2025, the team seeks to ﬁnd a solution to their pain points 
The Impact 
● Cost:  Inaccuracies and contractor disputes due to manual data errors lead to unknown costs accumulated, especially with more  
drilling in 2025. 
● Operations:  Limited and slow insights into rig performance, consumable usage, actuals vs budget hinder ability to identify  
cost-saving opportunities and improve operational eﬃciency. 
● Scalability : Increased drilling volume will overwhelm manual processes, hindering visibility into ops & costs, slowing down  
analysis, and impending eﬃcient scaling.  
● Unproductive  Spend: Delayed insights can result in signiﬁcant ﬁnancial losses (e.g. a week’s delay on stopped a hole could cost  
$100,000*).   
*Assuming each shift costs an average of $7,000

These inefficiencies are caused by 
● Reliance on spreadsheets: Forces the team to rely  manual data handling, eﬀort to ﬁnd and wrangle in data,  
and increasing risk of errors 
○ “It’s messy & cumbersome” 
● Data lives externally with Expedio: Each time the team needs to pull a report or make changes to their data or  
dashboard, it takes a week to 10 days to get visibility . 
○ Hinders real-time cost tracking and prevents proactive decision-making, essentially steering the ship  
almost blind.

Requirements 
Reports ● Exploration budget vs actual 
● Rig performances (utilisation) - compare 
● Timely Dashboard 
● Project progress reporting 
Forms ● Daily inspection forms 
● Need to get updates on this 
Rigs ● 4 at Hemi 
● 2 at Regional 
Projects ● Hemi Exploration 
● Regional Exploration 
Field Operations Management ● Workflow 
Other notes ● CorePlan SQL database 
● Hemi & Regional running as 2 different departments, but have moved into 1 
camp and need to standardise data

___{pain point} ____ will continue to snowball, inevitably 
resulting in {impacts to the business}.

● Ownership of data 
○ Full visibility & better control of the performance and 
cost with customisable reporting 
○ Proactive vs Reactive 
● Better management of full drilling lifecycle 
○ All-in-one space 
● Data & process standardisation 
○ Allow both teams to operate and collaborate 
eﬀectively 
● Big Wins
