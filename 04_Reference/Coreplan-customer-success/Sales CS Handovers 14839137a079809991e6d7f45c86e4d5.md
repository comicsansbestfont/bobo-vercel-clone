# Sales <> CS Handovers

# Context

In mining our sales cycles can quickly blow up and become longer than necessary. Following a strongly guided sales process to take the customer’s champion and stakeholder groups through their evaluation and selection with the right guardrails in place is - absolutely critical - and without it we risk never ending sales cycles or lost opportunities.

The sales journey has critical points where the Sales team need to engage the Customer Success team and where the customer success team needs to deliver to customer and the sales team. The sales team need to deliver the right information and granular context for CS team in order to achieve this. So, Getting to a customer through to closed won is truly a team effort.

# **Solutions Demonstration - WIP**

## What is it?

During the sales demos customers will ask you technical questions specific to their workflow that may not be directly obvious. As you develop your expertise in the product and customer’s workflow you will be able to conduct these yourself. 

Further to that customers may want to see specific reporting or a certain part of the product to deep dive into or integrations capabilities.

For these instances you will engage presales to conduct the solutions demonstration to take the customer through the workflows.

## What is needed for a Solutions Demonstration?

- Understanding of their current workflows ( in some instances it helps mapping in a miroboard or google slides)
- SPICE (D is not necessary)
-

# **Desktop Study**

## What is it?

It is a demonstration of the CorePlan platform to the customer with the customer’s data. The demonstration is to address key questions the customer has or showcase the capabilities of key use cases the customer is experiencing pain. This is uncovered through the sales process through `deep discovery questions` (link).

The desktop study also acts as a *trojan horse* to identify gaps in the customers reporting or dataset. We have in instances found that customers are spending exorbitant amounts in excess (mining) or losing revenue (drilling).

## What is needed for a desktop study?

- Drilling Plod Data in excel format for a period of at least 2 billing cycles but max 4.
- Invoice/claims for the corresponding period
- schedule of rates for that plod data
- maximum 5 rigs and 1 project only (unless approved by manager)

## Acceptance criteria for a desktop study

Running a desktop study is a large investment and cost from our side. *(Most traditional consultancies or software companies charge big bucks for this type of studies).* So ensuring that the you the customer and the cs team are setup for success means that the key qualification criteria need to be met for a customer to be accepted by CS to do a desktop study and manager approval.

🔑

🚨

**The Handover Document**

</aside>

It is crucial that you fill this document out properly to offload all relevant information and with granularity. Chatgpt generated documents lack the specificity and depth needed to communicate the critical information needed by the team.

<VIDEO EXLPAINER> + Example of good one

### **Step 3: Update CRM and business case update**

- Move the deal into Desktop Study and update any sales notes required

## For CS: Deliverables from CS

CS team must be able to deliver to the Sales team and customer:

- A configured account ready for demonstration by CS or Sales
- A gap analysis document (which sales can turn into preso)
    - Barrick Example: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13UOEzMfBd-5vy5Fn8fve8zOtvkboch1pBq6GvMMEMBA/edit
    - Vale example: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FPGUCpK2R79VNlDl2kQFgzYcTRawN3WtKSwvSvmSYds/edit#slide=id.g1085b4ca265_0_1048
- Expertise on findings into business case

## **[Overall section for full cs - wip] For CS: Vital Operations**

It is critical that you have a thorough understanding of your accounts in flight and you’re minimising as much as possible for any spanners for delays.

# **Proof of Concept WIP**

---

- POCs are a high time investment from our end. whilst we charge for these it is purely designed to gain commmitment from customer, go through their procurement and test the champion’s ability to drive the implementation.
- POCs typically come after a desktop study (typically if the official desktop study process is skipped we include is as part of the POC)
- POCs require a strong business case development in progress with clear path to closed won which includes strategic alignment meetings with the champions, stakeholder groups and internal teams.
- you have to ‘do the work’ to get these across which means really fleshing out customer’s SPICED through effective questioning and listen actively to what the customer is both saying and not saying. Your job is to help the customer flesh out the business case and key criteria
- Strategic alignment meetings are to be run with Sales and Presales
- For larger implementations we create a POC alignment doc
