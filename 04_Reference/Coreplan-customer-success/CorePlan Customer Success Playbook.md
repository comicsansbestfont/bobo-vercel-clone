# Coreplan Customer Success Playbook

Okay, let's get this right. I'm taking the lead on this documentation, and I want to make sure it's something my team will actually use and find valuable. We're aiming for a balance of high-level strategy and actionable detail – a true playbook for how we operate in Customer Success at CorePlan.

**Document Title:** CorePlan Customer Success Playbook

**1\. Our Customer Success Philosophy**

* **1.1. Mission and Vision**  
  * **Our Mission:** We empower people in mining to work better, together, in the modern age.  
    * *Why this matters to us:* This isn't just about software; it's about improving the daily lives of our users. We believe that by facilitating seamless collaboration and providing access to the right information, we can make their work less stressful, more productive, and ultimately, more rewarding. This people-centric approach guides every decision we make, from product development to how we interact with customers.  
  * **Our Vision:** To be the leading force in driving the digital transformation of mining, by building great software that advances drilling program operations.  
    * *What we're striving for:* We're not just aiming to sell software; we want to be pioneers in our industry. We envision a future where technology is fully integrated into every aspect of mining operations, and we see CorePlan as a key enabler of that transformation. We're committed to continuous innovation, pushing the boundaries of what's possible, and setting the standard for excellence in mining software.  
* **1.2. The CorePlan Advantage: Understanding Our Market**  
  * *The criticality of data:* Let's face it: in mining, data is king. Visibility into drilling charges and production metrics isn't a "nice-to-have"; it's the lifeblood of the operation. It directly impacts the bottom line, regulatory compliance, and the ability to make sound business decisions. Both mining companies and drilling contractors rely on this information to optimize their performance.  
  * *The pain points we address:* The old way of doing things is riddled with problems. We're talking about a chain reaction of negative consequences that affect everyone involved. Think about it:  
    * **Commercial impact**: Inaccurate cost tracking leads to revenue leakage, disputes over billing, and difficulty in assessing true profitability.  
    * **Compliance headaches**: Manual processes make it incredibly difficult to adhere to increasingly complex regulatory requirements and contractual obligations, exposing companies to significant risk.  
    * **Operational inefficiencies**: Lack of real-time data, fragmented communication, and cumbersome workflows result in delays, errors, wasted resources, and increased operational costs.  
    * *The ripple effect:* These issues don't stay confined within the four walls of a single company. They create friction and distrust between mining companies and drilling contractors, hinder collaboration, and ultimately impede progress across the entire industry.  
  * *The challenges we face:* We're operating in a unique and challenging environment. Here's what we're up against:  
    * **High-stakes complexity**: Drilling operations are incredibly complex, involving intricate workflows, specialized equipment, and large sums of money. Any inefficiency or error can have major financial repercussions.  
    * **Diverse stakeholders**: We're dealing with a wide range of stakeholders, each with their own priorities and concerns. From geologists and engineers to drillers, safety officers, and regulatory bodies, we need to cater to everyone's needs and facilitate effective communication.  
    * **A history of failed digitization**: The mining industry has been burned before by technology. Many companies have invested in solutions that didn't deliver on their promises, leading to skepticism and a reluctance to embrace new tools. We need to overcome this skepticism by proving the tangible value of CorePlan.  
    * **SaaS adoption gap**: Compared to other industries, mining has been slow to adopt SaaS. This is due to factors like remote locations, limited IT infrastructure, and a deeply ingrained "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality.  
    * **Generational shift**: We're seeing a changing of the guard, with digitally native millennials and Gen Z professionals moving into decision-making roles. These individuals have different expectations when it comes to technology and are more likely to embrace modern solutions.  
    * **Market confusion**: Companies like Imdex have increased awareness of digital tools, which is great, but it has also created a crowded marketplace. Customers are often overwhelmed by the sheer number of options and struggle to differentiate between them. We need to provide clarity and demonstrate why CorePlan is the superior choice.  
    * **Emerging competition**: As the demand for digital solutions in mining grows, we're seeing new competitors enter the space. We need to stay ahead of the curve by continuously innovating and delivering exceptional value.  
    * **Long sales cycles**: Selling to large mining enterprises is a marathon, not a sprint. These organizations have complex procurement processes, multiple stakeholders to convince, and a high degree of risk aversion. We need to be patient, persistent, and build strong relationships.  
    * **The driller dynamic**: Drilling contractors are absolutely critical to the success of any mining operation. We need to recognize their importance, understand their needs, and ensure that CorePlan facilitates seamless collaboration between them and mining companies.  
* **1.3. Our Strategic Priorities**  
  * **Our North Star:** To establish CorePlan as *the* integrated drilling management platform that the mining industry relies on. We're not aiming to be just another software vendor; we want to be the go-to solution that streamlines operations, improves data accuracy, and fosters collaboration across the board.  
  * **Collaboration is key**: We believe that the future of mining lies in seamless collaboration. Our platform is designed to break down silos and connect all stakeholders involved in the drilling process, from mining company personnel to drilling contractor teams.  
  * **Empowering our customers**: We're committed to helping our customers achieve tangible results. For mining companies, this means gaining unprecedented visibility into their costs, optimizing resource allocation, and ensuring compliance with regulations. For drilling contractors, it means improving billing accuracy, controlling expenses, and streamlining reporting.  
* **1.4. How Our Product Delivers**  
  * **A platform built for collaboration**: CorePlan is more than just a piece of software; it's a collaborative hub that connects clients and contractors. We've designed it to facilitate seamless data sharing, real-time communication, and efficient coordination of activities.

That's why we take a high-touch, consultative approach to sales, working closely with potential clients to understand their needs and provide tailored solutions.  
  * **Enabling differentiation**: In a competitive market, our customers need every advantage they can get. CorePlan empowers them to stand out by providing them with the modern tools they need to operate more efficiently, make better decisions, and deliver greater value.  
  * **The "land and expand" strategy**: We don't just want to make a sale; we want to build long-term partnerships. Our "land and expand" strategy focuses on getting a foot in the door, demonstrating our value, and then growing our footprint within the customer's organization over time.  
  * **Leveraging our client portal**: Our client portal is more than just a repository of information; it's a powerful tool for customer engagement and lead generation. By providing valuable resources and tracking user activity, we can identify opportunities to expand our relationships and provide even greater value.  
  * **Driller partnerships are crucial**: We recognize the vital role that drilling contractors play in the mining ecosystem. We actively cultivate strong relationships with these key stakeholders, seeking their input, and collaborating with them to ensure that CorePlan meets the needs of the entire industry. These partnerships are invaluable for driving referrals and expanding our reach.  
* **1.6. Our Customer Success Pillars**  
  * **Tailored Approach**: We don't believe in a one-size-fits-all approach. Whether we're working with a mid-market company or a large enterprise, we provide highly customized service that addresses their specific needs and challenges.  
  * **Help the Buyer Buy**: Our sales process is about more than just closing deals; it's about educating and empowering our customers. We take a consultative approach, challenging their assumptions, providing valuable insights, and helping them build a compelling business case for adopting CorePlan.  
  * **Land and Expand**: We focus on building long-term relationships, starting with initial adoption at a single site or department and then expanding our footprint through referrals and by demonstrating the tangible value of CorePlan.  
  * **Client Portal**: Our client portal is a valuable resource for educating our customers, providing them with the tools and information they need to succeed.

  * To ensure consistency, efficiency, and a world-class customer experience, we've established the following key processes:  
    * **3.1. Sales to CS Handoff**  
      * *Objective:* To ensure a seamless transition of new customers from the Sales team to the Customer Success team. This process is critical for setting the stage for a successful implementation and long-term partnership.  
      * *Key Elements:*  
        * **Clear Ownership Transfer**: A well-defined point of transfer of ownership from the Sales representative to the designated Customer Success Manager (CSM).  
        * **Comprehensive Information Sharing**: The Sales team must provide the CSM with all relevant customer information, including:  
          * Customer background, business goals, and key stakeholders.  
          * Detailed information gathered during the sales process (e.g., SPICED framework, pain points, desired outcomes).  
          * Contractual details, including scope of work, agreed-upon deliverables, and timelines.  
          * Any specific customer requirements, technical specifications, or potential challenges.  
        * **Handover Meeting**: A formal meeting between the Sales team and the CSM to review the customer's background, needs, and expectations. This meeting provides an opportunity for the CSM to ask questions, clarify any ambiguities, and begin building a relationship with the customer.  
        * **Documentation**: All relevant customer information, including the agreed-upon scope of work, and gap analysis, must be documented in our CRM system (e.g., Salesforce) to ensure a single source of truth and easy access for all stakeholders.  
        * **Alignment on Next Steps**: A clear agreement on the next steps in the onboarding process, including the implementation kickoff meeting and any initial activities.  
    * **3.2. Pre-Sales Processes**  
      * The Pre-Sales phase is crucial for setting the foundation for customer success. It involves a series of activities designed to demonstrate the value of CorePlan, align our solution with the prospect's needs, and build a strong business case for adoption.  
      * It is possible for a customer to go through both a desktop study and a POC, or just one, before moving to implementation.  
        * **3.2.1. Solutions Demonstrations**  
          * *Purpose:* The primary goal of a solution demonstration is to showcase CorePlan's capabilities and address the prospect's specific workflow challenges and technical questions. It's about demonstrating how our software can solve their unique problems and deliver tangible value.  
          * *Key Elements:*  
            * **Thorough Preparation**: Before the demo, the Presales team must conduct in-depth research to understand the prospect's industry, business, and specific needs. This includes reviewing their website, industry reports, and any information gathered by the Sales team.  
            * **Customization**: Generic demos rarely resonate. We need to tailor each demonstration to the prospect's specific use case, highlighting the features and functionalities that are most relevant to their workflow.  
            * **Engaging Delivery**: A successful demo is not just about showing the software; it's about telling a story. We need to engage the prospect, connect with their pain points, and demonstrate how CorePlan can make their lives easier.  
            * **Clear Value Proposition**: Throughout the demo, we must emphasize the value that CorePlan delivers. This includes quantifying the benefits, such as increased efficiency, reduced costs, improved accuracy, and enhanced collaboration.  
            * **Handling Objections**: Prospects will often raise objections or concerns during the demo. We need to be prepared to address these confidently and professionally, providing clear and concise answers.  
            * **Call to Action**: Every demo should end with a clear call to action, outlining the next steps in the sales process. This could be scheduling a follow-up meeting, initiating a desktop study, or proposing a proof of concept.  
        * **3.2.2. Desktop Studies**  
          * *Purpose:* A desktop study is a more in-depth evaluation of CorePlan, designed to provide the prospect with a realistic view of how our software would work with their own data and workflows. It allows us to identify potential gaps, assess the feasibility of implementation, and develop a detailed gap analysis document.  
          * *Key Elements:*  
            * **Qualification Criteria**: A desktop study is a significant investment of time and resources, so it's essential to ensure that it's only conducted for qualified prospects. The following criteria must be met before initiating a desktop study:  
              * There needs to be tangible commitment from the potential client.  
              * The SPICED framework needs to be completed.  
              * At least two demos should have been conducted (must include the decision-maker).  
              * If there is a specialized technical requirement, a technical session should have been scheduled to discuss feasibility.  
              * Ballpark pricing has been confirmed.  
              * Demo data cannot adequately address the prospect's pain points.  
              * The Desktop Study Handover document is completed and handed over to the Pre-Sales CS team for configuration.  
            * **Scope and Data Requirements**: To ensure a focused and efficient desktop study, we need to define clear boundaries:  
              * Limit the study to one project.  
              * Include a maximum of five rigs.  
              * Use a maximum of two months of data.  
              * Specify the required data format (e.g., Plod data in Excel or PDF format, charge information).  
            * **Workflow**: The desktop study process should follow a structured workflow:  
              * Introduction: Briefly outline the context of the session and explain the purpose of the desktop study.  
              * Business case presentation: The Sales team presents the business case, highlighting the prospect's needs and the value proposition of CorePlan.  
              * Desktop study demonstration: The CS team conducts a configured demonstration of CorePlan using the prospect's data.  
              * Q\&A: A joint session where Sales and CS address any questions or concerns from the prospect.  
              * Pricing discussion: The Sales team provides pricing information and discusses potential commercial arrangements.  
              * Next steps: The Sales team outlines the next steps in the sales process, such as scheduling a follow-up meeting or proposing a proof of concept.  
            * **Gap Analysis Document**: A key deliverable of the desktop study is a gap analysis document. This document outlines the prospect's needs, details how CorePlan addresses those needs, and identifies any potential gaps or areas that require further discussion or customization. The gap analysis will outline how the findings from the desktop study will inform the business case. This document will be used throughout the sales process and into implementation.  
            * **Data Request Template**: To streamline the data collection process, we use a standardized data request template. This template clearly outlines the required data, format, and delivery method.  
        * **3.2.3. Proof of Concept (POC)**  
          * *Purpose:* A POC is a more formal and in-depth evaluation of CorePlan in a live environment. It's designed to validate that our solution can meet the prospect's specific requirements and provide them with the confidence to move forward with a purchase.  
          * *Key Elements:*  
            * **When to Initiate**: A POC is typically initiated after a desktop study, especially if the study reveals gaps or the prospect needs to test the system in a live environment. However, a POC may also be conducted directly if the opportunity is large or strategically important.  
            * **Criteria for Conducting a POC**:  
              * Strong business case with a clear path to a closed-won deal. The Sales team is responsible for driving the creation of the business case, with support from CS as needed. The gap analysis from the desktop study will be a key input into the business case.  
              * Customer commitment to actively participate in the POC and provide necessary resources.  
              * Alignment with our strategic priorities and resource availability.  
            * **Key Stages and Activities**:  
              * Business case development: Sales and Presales collaborate to help the prospect develop a compelling business case for adopting CorePlan.  
              * Strategic alignment meetings: We conduct meetings with the prospect's champions, stakeholder groups, and our internal teams to ensure everyone is aligned on the POC's objectives, scope, and success criteria.  
              * POC execution: The prospect uses a dedicated CorePlan environment to test the system with their own data and workflows. We provide ongoing support and guidance during this phase.  
            * **POC Alignment Document**: For larger implementations, we create a detailed POC alignment document. This document outlines the POC's objectives, scope, success criteria, roles and responsibilities, timeline, and reporting requirements. This document will incorporate the scope of work, and will be informed by the gap analysis.  
    * **3.3. Implementation Process**  
      * *Objective:* To provide a seamless and efficient onboarding experience for new CorePlan customers, ensuring they can quickly and easily start using our platform to achieve their business goals.  
      * *Key Elements:*  
        * **Scope of Work**: A clearly defined scope of work (SOW) is essential for a successful implementation. The SOW outlines the project's objectives, deliverables, timelines, and responsibilities for both CorePlan and the customer. It serves as a roadmap for the implementation process and helps to manage expectations. The SOW will be informed by the gap analysis.  
        * **Handover Documentation**: The Sales team will provide the Implementation team with comprehensive handover documentation, including the agreed-upon SOW, gap analysis, and any other relevant information gathered during the sales process. This ensures that the Implementation team has all the necessary context to begin the onboarding process.  
        * **Technical Solutions Sense Check**: For enterprise customers, Technical Solutions MUST conduct a sense check of the gap analysis and SOW to validate feasibility and alignment with best practices, prior to the implementation kickoff.  
      * *Key Stages:*  
        * **Kickoff**: The first step is a formal kickoff meeting, where we:  
          * Introduce the implementation team and key stakeholders.  
          * Review the project plan, timeline, and milestones, as outlined in the SOW.  
          * Confirm roles and responsibilities.  
          * Establish communication protocols.  
          * Set expectations for the implementation process.  
        * **Setup and Configuration**: In this stage, we configure CorePlan to meet the customer's specific requirements, as defined in the SOW and gap analysis:  
          * System setup and environment provisioning.  
          * Data migration and integration with existing systems.  
          * Customization of workflows, fields, and reports.  
          * User account creation and permission management.  
        * **Training**: Comprehensive training is essential to ensure customer adoption and success:  
          * Develop a tailored training plan based on user roles and needs, as identified in the gap analysis.  
          * Deliver training sessions (online, in-person, or a combination).  
          * Provide training materials, such as user guides, videos, and FAQs.  
          * Offer ongoing support and resources to reinforce learning.  
        * **Go-Live**: This is the exciting moment when the customer officially starts using CorePlan:  
          * Final system testing and validation.  
          * Cutover from legacy systems.  
          * Ongoing monitoring and support during the initial period.  
          * Celebration of the successful launch\!  
        * **Graduation**: Once the customer is fully operational and achieving their desired outcomes, as defined in the SOW, they "graduate" from the implementation phase:  
          * Transition to the Account Management team for ongoing support and growth.  
          * Conduct a post-implementation review to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.  
          * Document lessons learned to optimize future implementations.  
    * **3.4. Ongoing Customer Success**

      * *Objective:* To proactively identify and mitigate potential risks throughout the customer journey. We want to minimize any obstacles that could hinder customer success and ensure a smooth, predictable, and positive experience.  
      * *Key Strategies:*  
        * **Proactive Communication**: Open and transparent communication is essential for building trust and preventing misunderstandings. We need to keep customers informed about progress, potential challenges, and any changes that may affect them.  
        * **Early Issue Identification**: We need to be vigilant in identifying potential issues early on, before they escalate. This requires active listening, careful monitoring of customer interactions, and a deep understanding of their business and technical environment.  
        * **Risk Mitigation Plans**: For any identified risk, we need to develop a clear mitigation plan. This plan should outline the steps we will take to address the risk, the resources involved, and the timeline for resolution.  
        * **Escalation Paths**: In some cases, issues may require escalation to more senior management or other teams. We need to have well-defined escalation paths and procedures in place to ensure timely and effective resolution.  
        * **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**: We need to document all identified risks, mitigation plans, and resolutions in a central repository. This knowledge base will help us learn from past experiences and prevent similar issues from recurring.  
* **4\. Tools and Resources**  
  * To effectively manage our customer relationships and deliver exceptional service, we rely on a suite of tools and resources:  
    * **CRM (e.g., Salesforce):** Our central system for managing customer interactions, tracking progress, and maintaining a comprehensive view of each customer.  
    * **Project Management Software:** Tools like Asana or Monday.com help us plan, execute, and track implementation projects, ensuring timely delivery and clear communication.  
    * **Communication Platforms:** We use tools like Intercom and Slack to communicate with customers in real-time, answer questions, and provide proactive support.  
    * **Knowledge Base and Training Materials:** Our library of articles, tutorials, videos, and user guides empowers customers to learn at their own pace and become self-sufficient.
