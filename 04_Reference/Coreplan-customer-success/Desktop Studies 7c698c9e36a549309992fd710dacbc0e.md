# Desktop Studies

Conduct a configured technical demonstration to the customer based on pre-defined success criteria to either progress to closed won or POC through development of **gap analysis document**. 

Desktop Study has to meet all of the following qualification criteria:

- [ ]  There need to be tangible commitment from potential client.
- [ ]  The SPICED framework needs to be completed
- [ ]  At least 2 demos should have been conducted (must include the decision maker)
- [ ]  If there is a specialised technical requirement, technical session should have been scheduled to discuss the feasibility.
- [ ]  Ballpark pricing confirmed
- [ ]  If demo data can’t resolve their pain point, we can progress into a desktop study
- [ ]  Success Criteria for the Desktop Study - Desktop Study handover document should be completed and handed over to Pre-Sales CS team for configuration

- 1 Project
- Max of 5 Rigs
- 2 Months of data

# Data Request Template

## Using data from driller’s account

**Subject**: 

CorePlan: acceptance required for data sharing with <Mining Company>

**Email body**:

Hi <Drilling company responsible>,

<Mining company> would like to ingest plods into their CorePlan account from yours in order to assess the reporting capability and reconciliation of costs within the platform. At this stage, this process does not involve a connected cost contract, so we will reach out if that is required as per our company policies.

Please reply back confirming that it’s okay to share this data between the two companies, and feel free to call if you have any questions.

# Process

- [ ]  **Ensure objectives are defined**
    - What do they want from the desktop study?
    - What do we want them to take away from the desktop study?
- [ ]  **Assess the data required**
    - Do they want to see their own plod data in charts and reports?
    - For Exploration Hub, do they want to see tenement information and the associated reporting?
    - For Exploration Hub, do they want to assess the workflow/workstreams, and how it might look with their own workflow?
    - For either Drilling or Exploration, do they want to see their own Forms digitised on the platform?
    - And so on.
- [ ]  **Transfer of data**
    - Have a share folder set up if data transfer is required.
        - This is applicable if they are sending you data such as plods, drill hole information, workflow specifics, forms they would like to see in the platform and so on.
    - If plod data is required from one of our drilling customers, ensure we seek their permission to use it with the communication template above.
- [ ]  **Configuration**
    - Set up the account and input the appropriate data
        - This can include:
            - Contract rates
            - Drill hole importing (if necessary)
            - Tenement uploading
            - Form(s) creation
            - Plod importing
    - If plod data is being utilised, ensure costs align
- [ ]  **Liaise with prospect**
    - Communicate to prospect the desktop study is ready to go, and set up a time to go through it and any findings
