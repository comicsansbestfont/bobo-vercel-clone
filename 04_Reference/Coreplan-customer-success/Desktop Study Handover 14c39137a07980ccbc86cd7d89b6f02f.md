# Introduction

A desktop study is a process where we **temporarily** import a potential customer’s data into CorePlan and conduct a configured technical demonstration. This demonstration, based on pre-defined success criteria, will allow us to **analyse their needs and develop a gap analysis document**. The outcome of the desktop study should determine the next steps: either progressing to ‘closed won’ or initiating a Proof of Concept (POC).

They do NOT get direct access to the CorePlan platform during a desktop study unless explicitly approved by management.

The desktop study only covers the basic drilling management flow: 

- plods
- cost contracts
- reporting

If you need to show anything else, it needs to be explicitly approved by management

# When To Conduct Desktop Studies

- [ ]  At least 2 demos should have been conducted (must include decision maker) and demo data can’t resolve their pain point
- [ ]  There is a tangible commitment from potential customer

# Desktop Study Criteria

Before conducting the desktop study, it has to meet all the criteria: 

- [ ]  The SPICED framework needs to be completed
- [ ]  At least 2 demos conducted with the decision maker included in them
- [ ]  Ballpark pricing confirmed and they will be on the Enterprise plan
- [ ]  If there is a specialised technical requirement, technical session should have been scheduled to discuss the feasibility
- [ ]  Success criteria determined for the desktop study
- [ ]  Desktop Study handover document should be completed and handed over to Pre-sales CS team for configuration

# What do you need to do before running a desktop study

### Work closely with champion

| Understand the current process | Collaborate with the champion to thoroughly document their existing workflow, including tools, challenges, and areas for improvement. Ensure you can pinpoint specific challenges in their current process and quantify their impact on the business (e.g., time wasted, lost revenue, errors). |
| --- | --- |
| Define success criteria | Determine clear, measurable objectives for the desktop study with the champion. Ask questions like: What are we hoping to achieve with this study? How will this study demonstrate value beyond a standard demo? What specific outcomes will indicate a successful session and justify next steps? |
| Identify risks | Proactively identify potential obstacles with the champion. Are there functionality gaps in CorePlan? Is the budget already available for them to buy? Is there anything that will stagnate this deal (and eventually lose it?) |
| Identify blockers  | Work with the champion to identify who the blockers are. Who are the stakeholders resistant to this change? How much impact do they have on business decisions? And how can we get them over the line? |

### Workshop your findings and dry-run with the champion

Collaborate closely with the champion to workshop, review and refine your findings. You can use a powerpoint to facilitate real-time editing and ensure alignment.  

This presentation should clearly articulate: 

1. The current situation
2. Impact on the business
3. Underlying pain points caused by inefficiencies
4. Map of the current process 
5. Highlight the critical event statement 
6. The envisioned future state with CorePlan 

Encourage the champion to actively participate by providing their insights and filling in any gaps within the presentation.

### Collect data from the prospects

As a rule of thumb, we **limit** the desktop study to: 

- 1 project
- 5 rigs
- 2 months of data

| **Area** | **What the clients want to see** | **What the config team require** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Drilling data  | How plods look like in CorePlan  | Current plods in Excel format - PDF if paper method  |
| Cost Reconciliation  | How the charges are applied and reconciled  | Charge information including metre rates, time activities, consumables, equipment hire 

Current plods in excel - PDF if paper method

Invoices for the same rigs, time periods as the plods  |
| Reporting | How our reports and analytics would look like  | Charge information including metre rates, time activities, consumables, equipment hire 

Current plods in excel - PDF if paper method

Invoices for the same rigs, time periods as the plods 

Current reporting they have for the same time period as the plods  |
| Drill Holes  | How the hole looks like on CorePlan  | Drill hole coordinate reference system 

Current list of drill holes (Site Name, Commencement Name, Planned & Actual X, Y, RL, Azi, Dip, Planned depth)  |
| Field Workflow | How pre-drilling and post-drilling workflow owuld look like on CorePlan  | Drill hole coordinate reference system 

Current list of drill holes (Site Name, Commencement Name, Planned & Actual X, Y, RL, Azi, Dip, Planned depth) 

Current drill hole lifecycle workflow (what are their current pre and post drilling activity order)

List of workstreams |
| Forms & Documents | How the Forms and Documents look like on CorePlan  | 5 of their main forms and documents they have - both empty and filled out |

### Go through the desktop study flow with internal stakeholders

Before conducting the desktop study or the dry run, hold an internal preparation session with key internal stakeholder(s) involved (ie pre-sales CS, and anyone else who will be in the desktop study). 

During the session, review the planned flow of the desktop study, emphasising any key points to highlight and address, including potential gaps in CorePlan’s capabilities. 

Collaboratively identify potential risks, such as feature limitations or integration challenges, and brainstorm effective solutions to mitigate them. 

This collaborative preparation ensures a smooth and successful desktop study that accurately represents CorePlan's value proposition while addressing any customer concerns proactively.

# Desktop Study Flow

| Step  | Action  | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |

| 2 | Business case | Sales |
| 3 | Desktop study | CS  |
| 4 | Q&A | Sales & CS |
| 5 | Pricing  | Sales |
| 6  | Next steps | Sales |

# Data Request Template

<aside>
📧

If prospects are using CorePlan’s client portal and choose to use drill data from there, you’ll need to send an email to the driller requesting access to the drill data 

</aside>

**Subject**: 

CorePlan: acceptance required for data sharing with <Mining Company>

**Email body**:

Hi <Drilling company responsible>,

<Mining company> would like to ingest plods into their CorePlan account from yours in order to assess the reporting capability and reconciliation of costs within the platform. At this stage, this process does not involve a connected cost contract, so we will reach out if that is required as per our company policies.

Please reply back confirming that it’s okay to share this data between the two companies, and feel free to call if you have any questions.
