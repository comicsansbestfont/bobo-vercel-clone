# Sachee Voice and Tone Guide

**Purpose:** Define Sachee's authentic voice based on high-engagement LinkedIn posts and real conversations. Use this guide for all content creation—LinkedIn posts, website copy, email, and advisory materials.

---

## The Core Voice

**One-line summary:** Talk like you're explaining something to a mate at the pub—direct, honest, a bit self-deprecating, and genuinely helpful.

**The Vibe:**
- Australian casual, not American corporate
- Self-aware, not self-promotional
- Specific, not vague
- Vulnerable, not polished
- Helpful, not preachy

---

## Voice Markers (What Makes It Sound Like Sachee)

These patterns consistently appear in high-engagement content (200+ likes, 10K+ impressions):

### 1. Self-Deprecating Openers

Start with vulnerability or a twist that subverts expectations. Never open with credentials or achievements.

**Examples:**
- "A few months ago I was homeless and unemployed. Technically all true."
- "Turns out relaxing, for me, is building."
- "That lasted 72 hours."

**Pattern:** Setup → Twist → Context

### 2. Emojis as Punctuation

Use emojis sparingly but deliberately. They soften statements and add personality.

**Go-to emojis:**
- Self-deprecating moments, humble admissions
- Confident asides, wins worth celebrating
- Genuine questions, pondering
- Authentic care, sign-offs
- Playful, Australian character
- Geeky/technical moments

**Usage:** 2-4 emojis per post max. Never in headlines. Usually after a statement, not before.

### 3. Parenthetical Asides

Add conversational commentary in parentheses or dashes.

**Examples:**
- "Yes, they still funded us."
- "(Not recommending this—but it demonstrates the depth.)"
- "—same variables, higher stakes, worse data."

### 4. Short Punchy Sentences

Mix long context sentences with one-line punches. The contrast creates rhythm.

**Example:**
```
I'd just left my COO role at CorePlan after 5 years of 70-hour weeks. Shed 99% of my belongings, packed one suitcase, and travelled for 3 months trying to "do nothing."

That lasted 72 hours.
```

### 5. The "Howdy" Opening

Use "Howdy" for intros and warm contexts. It's distinctly Sachee.

**Where it works:** LinkedIn bio, friendly emails, personal intros
**Where it doesn't:** Formal proposals, serious announcements

### 6. "Made with love in WA"

Signature sign-off. Use on:
- LinkedIn bio
- Experience sections
- Longer-form content
- Personal announcements

### 7. Vulnerability with a Turn

Share genuine struggles, but always land somewhere useful. Never just complain.

**Pattern:** Struggle → What I learned → How it helps you

## Key Phrases (Use Once Each—Don't Over-Rotate)

| Phrase | Best Context |
|--------|--------------|
| "I think in systems, not slides." | Explaining approach to technical founders |
| "Revenue is just a messier system to debug." | Technical translator angle |
| "I invest time for equity. You keep your cash." | Equity model explanation |
| "Yes, I put memes in investor decks. Yes, they still funded us." | Bio, about sections, personality proof |
| "Made with love in WA" | Sign-offs |
| "When people love you, they buy, champion, and stay." | Philosophy statements |
| "Making B2B software lovable" | Mission/vision contexts |

---

## Tone by Context

### LinkedIn Posts (High Engagement)

**Tone:** Conversational, vulnerable, specific
**Length:** 150-400 words (short posts perform best)
**Structure:**
1. Hook (surprising, personal, or counterintuitive)
2. Story or context (specific details, numbers)
3. Insight or lesson
4. Optional CTA (soft, not pushy)

**Good hooks:**
- Personal stories with unexpected twists
- Contrarian takes backed by experience
- Specific numbers or results
- Honest admissions ("I used to think..." then "Now I know...")

**Avoid:**
- "I'm excited to announce..."
- Generic thought leadership
- Listicles without substance
- Humble-brags without payoff

### Website Copy

**Tone:** Direct, helpful, confident but not arrogant
**Key principle:** Speak to the reader, not about yourself

**Good:** "I help founders get their first 30 customers"
**Bad:** "Sachee is a renowned expert in GTM strategy"

### Email/DMs

**Tone:** Warm, direct, helpful
**Always:** Get to the point fast
**Never:** Over-explain or apologize for reaching out

### Advisory Materials (Decks, Frameworks)

**Tone:** Clear, practical, no-BS
**Key principle:** Stupidly obvious + highly detailed

**Good:** Tables, checklists, specific questions, templates
**Bad:** Abstract concepts without actionable next steps

## What to Avoid

### Corporate Speak
- "Leverage synergies across ecosystems"
- "Excited to share..."
- "Thought leadership"
- "Best-in-class solutions"

### Hustle Porn
- "Rise and grind"
- "Outwork everyone"
- Generic motivational quotes

### Over-Claiming
- Inventing results not backed by real work
- Vague success metrics ("grew revenue significantly")
- Claiming expertise in areas without experience

### Trying Too Hard
- Forced humor
- Emojis in every sentence
- Self-deprecation that becomes self-pity

## The Authenticity Checklist

Before publishing anything, ask:

- [ ] Does this sound like I'm talking to a mate at the pub?
- [ ] Is there at least one specific detail (number, name, place)?
- [ ] Would I actually say this out loud?
- [ ] Is there a self-deprecating aside? (for casual content)
- [ ] Did I avoid corporate speak?
- [ ] Does it have a story or specific moment, not just opinions?
- [ ] Would this fit with my highest-performing posts?
