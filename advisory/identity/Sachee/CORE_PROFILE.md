# Sachee Identity: Core Profile

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for who Sachee is, who he serves, and how to represent him in strategy development and content.

This profile is opinionated but factual. It is written for:
- Humans using this workspace to build GTM frameworks and client deliverables.
- AI agents supporting strategy work, content creation, and research.

---

## 1. Snapshot

- **Name:** Sachee Perera
- **Primary Role:** B2B SaaS Operator-Advisor ("Full-Stack Operator")
- **Positioning:** *"Build the engine. Build the team. Scale together."*
- **Specialisation:** Early-stage, founder-led B2B SaaS (0–10M ARR), with a focus on vertical SaaS, heavy industry, and complex B2B sales. Integrates GTM + People + Ops as one system.
- **Background:** Former COO at CorePlan (mining tech SaaS) where he built the integrated commercial engine (Sales, Marketing, CS, RevOps) AND hired the teams that ran it—from first customer to scale.
- **Geography Focus:** Australia and New Zealand (primary), with content and frameworks that generalise globally.
- **Website:** https://www.sachee.com.au

Use this section when you need a fast understanding of who Sachee is.

## 2. Positioning & Category

**Positioning Tagline:**
> *"Build the engine. Build the team. Scale together."*

**Simple positioning line:**
> *"I help B2B SaaS founders in complex, under-digitized markets build practical GTM systems—and the teams that run them—from $0 to $10M ARR."*

**Category: The "Full-Stack Operator"**
- Not a generic "growth hacker" or paid-ads consultant.
- Not a pure "fractional CRO" who only focuses on sales.
- Not a recruiter who places heads without building systems.
- Instead: an **Operator-Advisor** who brings an integrated view of GTM + People + Ops as one system—grounded in deep experience building and hiring in under-digitised, high-ACV industries.

**The White Space:**
Most advisors choose a lane: GTM strategy OR hiring OR operations. Sachee integrates all three because that's how startups actually work. The "Full-Stack Operator" positioning reflects someone who has built the engine AND hired the teams that run it—multiple times, in hard industries.

**Differentiation vs typical GTM consultants:**
- **Built AND hired**: At CorePlan, didn't just design GTM systems—hired and scaled the teams to run them (Sales, Marketing, CS, RevOps).
- **Hard industries**: Operated in vertical SaaS and mining tech where deals are complex, customers aren't tech-native, and generic playbooks fail.
- **Integrated engine**: Built and documented end-to-end commercial systems (SPICED, presales, CS, content, hiring frameworks) as interconnected parts.
- **Founder-led as permanent**: Emphasises founder-led sales as a permanent capability, not a phase to "graduate out of".
- **Practical over polished**: Obsessed with making GTM **lovable** and **stupidly obvious + highly detailed**, not abstract decks.

## 4. Ideal & Early Customer Profiles (ICP / ECP)

**Strategic Context:** Sachee's current focus is on Phase 1a/1b founders (<$200K ARR) via equity engagements. This is deliberate strategy to: (1) build an equity portfolio, (2) validate and refine playbooks, (3) build credibility for future Phase 2/3 cash engagements.

### 4.1 Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

*The ICP describes who Sachee is building toward serving at premium cash rates (Phase 2+, >$200K ARR).*

Early-stage B2B SaaS and tech-enabled marketplace founders who:
- Are in **Phase 2** (200K–1M ARR) with traction but need to scale beyond founder-led.
- Operate in **vertical or complex B2B markets** (e.g. mining, heavy industry, regulated sectors).
- Sell high-ACV products with multi-stakeholder buying groups and long sales cycles.
- Have founder-led or founder-involved sales as the core GTM motion.
- Want a clear, practical operating system for GTM rather than random tactics.

### 4.2 Early Customer Profile (ECP)

*The ECP describes who Sachee is working with NOW via equity—the stepping stone to ICP.*

Founders who feel the pain most acutely **right now**:
- In **Phase 1a/1b** (<$200K ARR) with first customers but no clear pattern yet.
- Running into stalled growth or "random wins" and can't figure out why.
- Struggling to convert early traction into a repeatable GTM motion.
- Overwhelmed by conflicting advice about sales, marketing, and hiring.
- Willing to invest time and attention into structured GTM work (coachable, not looking for silver bullets).
- **Willing to offer meaningful equity** (2–12%) in exchange for hands-on GTM partnership.

**Why ECP matters:** ECPs provide equity upside, real reps to validate playbooks, and case studies to build credibility for Phase 2/3 cash clients.

Use these definitions when designing offers, messaging, or content—especially in Phase 1a/1b GTM work.

## 6. Backstory & Origin

High-level narrative for use in content and intros. For full detail, see `04_Reference/Sachee Perera - Resume.pdf`.

- Started career in **high-volume telco sales and retention** (TSA Telco Group), progressing from part-time outbound and support roles to leading sales and retention teams for Telstra campaigns. Learned how to sell in tough conditions, coach teams, and design basic processes and dashboards.
- Moved into **hospitality and membership turnaround** (Accor Plus), taking full P&L ownership of an underperforming programme and rebuilding sales strategy, team culture, and performance management to deliver record new sales and renewal rates across APAC.
- Joined **UberEATS Perth** as part of the launch team, acting as "first boots on ground" for restaurant partnerships—personally selling and onboarding a large share of the initial restaurant base while shaping playbooks and metrics for expansion.
- Led **Sidekicker's expansion into WA** as General Manager, again as "first boots on ground", building a dual-sided marketplace from scratch: designing local GTM, improving worker onboarding and quality, and driving strong marketplace growth and repeat usage.
- Advised **Austal Ships** on early-stage GTM for AI/data analytics products in the ferry market, running customer discovery and early commercialisation planning.
- At **CorePlan**, joined pre–product-market fit and helped transform a multi-product consultancy into a focused mining SaaS provider. Built the integrated GTM engine (marketing, enterprise sales, SPICED-based discovery, presales, CS, rev ops) and scaled commercial and non-technical teams while driving significant ARR and customer growth.
- After CorePlan, shifted from full-time operator to **B2B SaaS GTM advisor**, codifying these lessons into the **GTM Strategy Workbook**, **Sachee-isms**, and a library of sales/CS playbooks and training materials. Now uses that operating system to help early-stage founders avoid random GTM tactics and build **practical, founder-led systems** that fit their context.

## 7. Core Philosophy & Sachee-isms

Sachee's work is underpinned by a set of operating principles documented in detail in:
`04_Reference/SACHEE_ISMS_OPERATING_PRINCIPLES.md`

The 13 core principles include:
- **"Speed is our weapon"** – move faster than incumbents.
- **"Always solve for the customer"** – customer outcomes drive retention and referrals.
- **"Meet the customer where they're at"** – don't assume buyers are tech-native or self-serve.
- **"When they zig, we zag"** – contrarian, focused positioning beats chasing consensus.
- **"Save the cheerleader, save the world"** – win a tight beachhead segment to unlock the broader market.
- **"Stupidly obvious + highly detailed"** – be both simple and deeply specific.
- **"Do things that don't scale"** – especially for the first 10–30 customers.
- **"People buy from people, not logos"** – founder-led content and presence beat faceless brand marketing.

For strategy work, treat these as **decision lenses**. For content work, treat them as **recurring themes** and hooks.

---

## 8. Vertical & Domain Experience

Sachee has deep experience in:

- **Mining & Heavy Industry**
  - Selling into drilling contractors, mine operators, and industrial teams.
  - Working in under-digitised, safety-critical, operationally complex environments.
  - Translating field workflows into digital products and GTM messaging.

- **Vertical SaaS & Complex B2B**
  - Building category narratives where the category often doesn't fully exist yet.
  - Navigating long sales cycles with multiple stakeholders and complex internal politics.
  - Using consultative frameworks like SPICED to uncover deep business pain and justify high-ACV deals.

Content and strategy should lean into these domains when looking for examples, case studies, and proof points.

## 9. Technical Background: The "Technical Translator"

**The Core Hook:** "The Engineer who chose to build Revenue Engines."

Most GTM advisors are pure commercial operators who treat product as a black box. Sachee is an **Engineer by Training, GTM by Choice**—someone with formal systems thinking who decided that building commercial engines was a harder, more rewarding problem than building physical ones.

### 9.1 The Engineering Foundation

- **Education:** Mechanical Engineering degree. Formal training in systems thinking, problem decomposition, and working within constraints—skills that translate directly to GTM architecture.
- **The Choice:** Chose business over engineering because "business engineering" felt like a harder, more rewarding problem. Same systems thinking, messier variables, higher stakes.

### 9.2 The Programming Background (Pre-AI Technical Fluency)

This isn't vibe-coding fluency—it's foundational technical competence built before AI made shipping code easy:

- **High School:** Built a complete stock management system in Visual Basic from scratch—not a tutorial project, but real architecture: data models, inventory logic, user interfaces.
- **University (Programming 101):** Scored 100% in C and C# programming. Didn't just pass—mastered it.
- **Teaching & Mentoring:** Taught peers how to code. Helped classmates with assignments. Became the person others came to when they were stuck.
- **The Proof of Mastery:** Confident enough in the material to sit a friend's final programming exam for them. (Not recommending this—but it demonstrates the depth of understanding.)

**Why this matters:** Sachee doesn't just "get" technical concepts at a surface level. He thinks in objects, loops, and logic flows. When a technical founder explains their architecture, he doesn't need it dumbed down.

### 9.3 "Sharpening the Saw" (Why I Still Build)

- **The Practice:** Building personal tools (Lovabo) in Cursor/Vercel/Supabase—not as a business, but as training.
- **The Purpose:** To maintain **Technical Empathy**. Wrestling with edge cases and database schemas keeps me honest about what's actually possible.
- **The Promise:** "I won't give you GTM advice that breaks your engineering team's backlog."

### 9.4 GTM as Engineering Problem

- **The Frame:** GTM is not magic—it's debugging. Isolate the variables (ICP, message, channel, offer). Test. Fix. Repeat.
- **Why this matters:** Technical founders already think this way. Sachee speaks their language—no translation required.
- **The Narrative:** "I didn't fail at engineering or programming—I mastered both and then realized that revenue is just a messier system. Same variables, higher stakes, worse data."

### 9.5 Usage Guidelines for the "Technical Translator" Angle

Use this angle **selectively, as a trust accelerator** with technical founders:

- **Good contexts:** 1:1 conversations with technical founders, building rapport, explaining why GTM advice is realistic.
- **Bad contexts:** Leading LinkedIn bio, making it a content pillar, competing with fractional CTOs.
- **Primary positioning remains:** Operator credentials (hard industries, first boots on ground, 0-1M ARR focus).

## 10. LinkedIn Profile (Current)

**Last Updated:** December 2025

### Headline
> Making B2B Software Loveable | GTM & Brand Builder | Former COO @ CorePlan

### About Section (Bio)

```
Howdy, I'm Sachee.

A few months ago I was homeless and unemployed. Technically all true.

I'd just left my COO role at CorePlan after 5 years of 70-hour weeks. Shed 99% of my belongings, packed one suitcase, and travelled for 3 months trying to "do nothing."

That lasted 72 hours. Turns out relaxing, for me, is building.

---

MY BACKGROUND:

Started as a mechanical engineer. Scored 100% in programming. Could've stayed technical. But I realised revenue is just a messier system to debug...same variables, higher stakes, worse data.

So I took the weird route:
- TSA Telco Group (6 years, outbound sales & operations to Sales Manager)
- Accor Plus (delivered highest growth seen in 10 years)
- UberEATS Perth launch (sold first 100+ restaurants)
- Sidekicker WA (built market, team, and ops from zero)
- CorePlan COO (pre-PMF to $6.5M ARR, 100+ customers, team of 20+)

Yes, I put memes in investor decks. Yes, they still funded us.

---

WHAT I DO NOW:

Last couple of months one conversation led to another and now I help B2B SaaS founders in hard industries get their first 30 customers—and build the team to scale beyond founder-led selling.

Why technical founders work with me: I think in systems, not slides. When you explain your architecture, I don't need it dumbed down.

How I work:
- Early stage (<$200K ARR): I invest time for equity. You keep your cash.
- Scaling stage: Advisory retainers

My philosophy is simple: design the engine; people, product, positioning, and systems, which all compounds into customer experience and revenue.

When people love you, they buy, champion, and stay. That's defensible growth. And thats why Im all-in on making B2B software lovable. Connect with me to chat

## 11. Voice & Style Guidelines

*For detailed voice and tone guidance, see: `advisory/identity/Sachee/VOICE_AND_TONE.md`*

When writing as Sachee or on his behalf:

- **Tone:**
  - Direct, clear, and grounded.
  - Friendly but not fluffy.
  - Contrarian when needed, but never edgy for its own sake.

- **Style:**
  - Prefer **simple language** over jargon.
  - Use **specific examples, numbers, and stories** over generic advice.
  - Use **tables, checklists, and frameworks** to make thinking concrete.
  - Ask sharp diagnostic questions; avoid vague "thought leadership".

- **Avoid:**
  - Over-claiming or inventing results that are not backed by real work.
  - Corporate buzzwords and empty phrases ("synergies", "leverage ecosystems") unless you're explicitly critiquing them.
  - Generic hustle/founder porn.

---

## 12. Usage Guidelines for Humans & AI

- Do **not** invent employers, job titles, degrees, or case studies. If something is not in this profile or in referenced internal docs, treat it as unknown.
- When you need a proof point, **prefer internal sources**:
  - GTM Strategy Workbook (`03_ContentLibrary/Content/GTM-Framework/`)
  - Sachee-isms (`04_Reference/SACHEE_ISMS_OPERATING_PRINCIPLES.md`)
  - CorePlan & SwiftCheckin assets (`04_Reference/CorePlan-SalesPlaybook/`, `04_Reference/SwiftCheckin-Training/`, etc.)
  - Medium posts (`04_Reference/Medium-Blog-Posts/`)
- For public-facing content, cross-check any numbers (ARR, deal sizes, timelines) with real data before publishing. When in doubt, keep it qualitative.
- When starting a new AI-assisted strategy or content session, first:
  1. Read this profile.
  2. Summarise Sachee's identity in 5–7 bullets.
  3. Use that summary as grounding for all subsequent outputs.
