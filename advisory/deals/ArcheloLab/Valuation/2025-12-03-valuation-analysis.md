## 1. Phase Classification Analysis

### Evidence for Phase Classification

| Phase Criteria | Evidence | Assessment |
|----------------|----------|------------|
| ARR in range ($0-50K) | $0 | Yes (Phase 1a) |
| Customer count (0-10) | 0 paying customers | Yes (Phase 1a) |
| Paying full price (not pilots) | 0 of 0 | N/A - no customers |
| Similar customers (same ICP) | 0 of 0 | N/A - no customers |
| Describable buying motion | Organic inbound (people finding Ain online) | Partial |
| Could someone else close? | No - Ain doing everything | No |

**Red Flags for Misclassified Phase:**
- [x] Zero revenue, zero paying customers - pure idea/early MVP stage
- [x] Revenue = $0, customers = 0 - Reality Check required
- [ ] Platform issues (mobile UX, cluttered features) indicate MVP not ready

**Actual Phase Determination:** **Phase 1a (Zero Traction)**

## 2. Founder Engine Assessment

### Dimension Scores (1-5 scale)

| Dimension | Score | Evidence/Notes | Weight (Phase 1a) |
|-----------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **A. Selling Capability** | 2.5/5 | Gets organic inbound but no closed deals; platform issues suggest weak sales execution; relies on word-of-mouth vs. active selling | 20% |
| **B. Founder-Led Sales Execution** | 3/5 | Solo founder doing everything (dev, marketing, PM, sales); action-oriented but spread thin; not obsessively doing sales - doing everything | 15% |
| **C. Learning Velocity** | 4/5 | Receptive to feedback ("It's kind of an alarm for me"); rapid iteration after Nov 11 call; launched simplified MVP within weeks; completed positioning exercise quickly | 20% |
| **D. Problem Clarity** | 3.5/5 | Clear articulation of diaspora pain points (can't be present, don't trust relatives, fear of being ripped off); positioning evolved to "trust layer and operating system" | 18% |
| **E. Coachability** | 4/5 | Very receptive to Sachee's feedback; acknowledged "$20K spent almost in vain"; requested weekly check-ins; "jumped into action plan straight away" | 15% |
| **F. Positioning Instinct** | 3/5 | Has a wedge (diaspora + trust layer) but took external help to articulate; not yet contrarian positioning but differentiated | 12% |

**Weighted Founder Engine Score:** 3.09 / 5.0

**Calculation (Phase 1a):**
```
= (A × 0.20) + (B × 0.15) + (C × 0.20) + (D × 0.18) + (E × 0.15) + (F × 0.12)
= (2.5 × 0.20) + (3 × 0.15) + (4 × 0.20) + (3.5 × 0.18) + (4 × 0.15) + (3 × 0.12)
= 0.50 + 0.45 + 0.80 + 0.63 + 0.60 + 0.36
= 3.34
```

*Revised Founder Engine Score: **3.34 / 5.0***

| Score Range | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| 4.0+ | Exceptional - strong invest signal |
| 3.5-4.0 | Solid - investable |
| **3.0-3.5** | **Developing - advisory first** |
| 2.5-3.0 | Significant gaps - pass or coach-only |
| <2.5 | Not ready - pass |

**Red Flag Check:**
- [ ] High Selling (4-5) but Low Founder-Led Execution (1-2) = Has skills but not doing the work
- *Not applicable - both dimensions are moderate*

### Key Observations

**Strengths:**
1. High coachability and learning velocity - responds quickly to feedback
2. Domain expertise - runs a construction business in Sri Lanka, understands the industry
3. Clear problem articulation for diaspora segment
4. Action bias - implements feedback rapidly

**Development Areas:**
1. Selling capability weak - no closed deals, relies on inbound
2. Founder overwhelm - spread too thin across dev/marketing/PM/sales
3. Premature tech investment - $20K spent before validating sales motion
4. Team management - let entire team go, suggesting delegation issues

## 4. Scorecard Method Valuation

**Base:** $3.0M (AU pre-seed median 2025)

| Factor | Weight | Score (0.5-1.5) | Adjustment | Notes |
|--------|--------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| Founder/Team | 30% | 0.8 | -6% | Solo founder with domain expertise but spread thin; team failure ($20K burned, let team go); moderate FE score 3.34 |
| Market Size & Timing | 20% | 0.75 | -5% | Diaspora market is niche; Sri Lanka market dynamics uncertain; long-term play |

| Investor Signals | 5% | 0.75 | -1.25% | Actively fundraising but no confirmed interest; no prior funding; bootstrapped with personal funds |
| **Net Adjustment** | | | **-27.25%** | |

**Score Guide:**
- 0.5 = Major weakness
- 0.75 = Below average
- 1.0 = Average
- 1.25 = Above average
- 1.5 = Exceptional strength

**Scorecard Valuation:** $3.0M × (1 + -27.25%) = $3.0M × 0.7275 = **$2,182,500 (~$2.2M)**

## 5. Phase 1a Modifiers

*(Apply after Berkus/Scorecard triangulation)*

### A. Founder-Led Execution Modifier

| Founder-Led Execution Score | Modifier |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| 5 (Obsessively doing sales) | +15% |
| 4 (Actively doing sales) | +10% |
| **3 (Doing some sales)** | **0%** |
| 2 (Delegating most sales) | -15% |
| 1 (Avoiding sales / hired prematurely) | -25% |

**Score:** 3 → **Modifier: 0%**

### B. Market/Cultural Fit Modifier — NOT APPLIED

> **v2.2 Framework Note:**
> - **Section B** applies ONLY to companies WITH traction (paying customers OR revenue > $0)
> - **Section E3** applies ONLY to ZERO-TRACTION companies (ARR = $0 AND Customers = 0)
> - ArcheloLab is ZERO-TRACTION → **Section E3 applies, NOT Section B**
> - See Section E3 below for market-fit penalties

**Applied:** 0% (Section B not applicable to zero-traction deals)

### C. Premature Scaling Penalty (max -50%)

- [ ] Hired sales before founder closed 5+ deals: Not applicable (no sales hires)
- [ ] SDRs/BDRs before validated ICP: Not applicable
- [ ] Paid ads before positioning clear: Unknown - likely not significant
- [ ] 5+ employees with <$50K ARR: **-10%** (Previously had developers + marketing person, now let go)

**Applied:** -10%

### D. Grit/Tenacity Premium (max +25%)

- [ ] Manual high-touch sales (door-to-door, cold calling): No evidence
- [x] Evidence of facing rejection, iterating: **+5%** (Rapid iteration after feedback, acknowledged mistakes)
- [ ] Extreme capital efficiency: No (burned $20K pre-PMF)
- [ ] Bootstrapped to $50K+ ARR: No ($0 ARR)

**Applied:** +5%

**Total Phase 1a Modifier (pre-Reality Check):** 0% + 0% + (-10%) + 5% = **-5%**

*Note: Section B (Market/Cultural Fit) removed per v2.2 framework - penalties now applied via Section E3 for zero-traction deals.*

---

## 5a. Reality Check — MANDATORY (v2.2)

*Apply AFTER Phase 1a Modifiers. Zero-traction deals MUST pass through this gate.*

### Traction Status Assessment

| Question | Answer | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| ARR = $0? | **Yes** | Zero-Traction Discount required |
| Paying Customers = 0? | **Yes** | Zero-Traction Discount required |
| Working product in market? | **Yes** (early MVP at archelolab.com) | Reduced discount |
| Users (even non-paying)? | **Partial** (organic inbound but unclear usage) | Some mitigation |
| Founder from industry selling to? | **Yes** (runs construction business) | Reduced penalty |

### E1. Zero-Traction Discount

*(Apply if ARR = $0 AND Paying Customers = 0)*

| Condition | Discount | Applies? |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| No revenue + no customers | **-50% to -60%** | [x] |
| No revenue + no customers + no product | **-60% to -70%** | [ ] |
| Pilot/POC only (no paying customers) | **-30% to -40%** | [ ] |
| Has some paying customers | **0%** | [ ] |

**Reasoning:** ArcheloLab has ARR = $0 and Customers = 0, BUT has a working (albeit buggy) MVP. Standard -55% discount applies (midpoint of -50% to -60%).

**Zero-Traction Discount Applied:** **-55%**

### E2. Idea-Stage Valuation Cap

| Stage Evidence | Cap | Applies? |
|----------------|-----|----------|
| Idea only (no product) | $300K - $500K | [ ] |
| **MVP but no/few users** | **$400K - $600K** | [x] |
| MVP with users, no revenue | $500K - $800K | [ ] |
| First paying customer(s) | $800K - $1.5M | [ ] |
| Revenue + customers | No cap | [ ] |

**Reasoning:** ArcheloLab has an MVP live but unclear user traction. Organic inbound suggests some engagement but no structured user base. Apply $400K - $600K cap.

**Cap Applied:** **$400K - $600K**

### E3. Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty (ZERO-TRACTION DEALS ONLY)

> **v2.2 Framework Note:**
> - **Use Section E3** for ZERO-TRACTION deals ONLY (ARR = $0 AND Customers = 0)
> - **Use Section B instead** for companies with some traction
> - **NEVER apply both** Section B and Section E3 to the same deal
> - ArcheloLab is ZERO-TRACTION → **Section E3 applies**

#### Step 1: Base Penalty by Country/Industry Fit

| Condition | Base Penalty | Applies? |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Founder from country AND from industry | **0%** | [ ] |
| Founder from industry but NOT from country | **-10%** | [x] |
| Founder NOT from industry | **See Sales Complexity Table** | [ ] |
| Founder NOT from country AND NOT from industry | **See Sales Complexity + 5%** | [ ] |

**Assessment:** Founder has construction industry background (runs construction business in Sri Lanka) but is selling to diaspora customers in AU/UK/CAN (not from those countries).

**Base Penalty:** **-10%** (from industry but NOT from country)

#### Step 2: Variable Penalty by Sales Complexity (v2.2 Update)

*Even though founder has industry background, assess sale complexity for context.*

| Sale Type | Penalty Range | Examples | ArcheloLab Fit? |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| **High-touch enterprise** | -20% to -25% | Mining, construction, healthcare, govt | Partial - construction projects are complex |
| **SMB direct sales** | -15% to -20% | Tradies, restaurants, small hospitality | [ ] |
| **Horizontal SaaS to tech-native buyers** | -10% to -15% | Dev tools, marketing tech | [ ] |

**Sale Complexity Assessment:**

ArcheloLab's sale is HYBRID - complex elements include:
- **Trust-intensive**: Diaspora trusting platform with large construction/renovation investments ($50K-$500K+)
- **Multi-party coordination**: Diaspora client + Sri Lankan architect + contractors + platform
- **Long decision cycle**: Construction projects take months to plan
- **Cultural/geographic barriers**: Founder in Sri Lanka, customers in AU/UK/CAN
- **Emotional stakes**: Often family homes, inheritance properties

This is closer to **high-touch enterprise complexity** than SMB direct sales, despite the B2C/B2B2C nature.

**However:** Since founder IS from the industry (runs construction business), the variable penalty table doesn't directly apply. The -10% base penalty for "from industry but NOT from country" already captures this risk.

**Reasoning (Updated):**
- Founder has construction background (from industry) - this provides credibility with architects/contractors (supply side)
- Founder is Sri Lankan - this provides cultural alignment with supply side
- Primary customer is diaspora in AU/UK/CAN - founder is NOT from those countries
- This is the "from industry but NOT from country" scenario
- No additional variable penalty applies because founder IS from industry

**Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty Applied:** **-10%**

*Note: If founder had NO industry background, an additional -20% to -25% would apply given the high-touch complexity of construction/diaspora sales.*

### E4. Override Conditions

*(Reduce discount if applicable - max 50% reduction of original discount)*

| Condition | Reduction | Applies? |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Serial entrepreneur with successful exit | +20% | [ ] |
| Deep domain expert (10+ years in industry) | +15% | [x] (runs construction business) |
| Proprietary technology with IP protection | +10% | [ ] |
| Strong existing investor commitments | +10% | [ ] |

**Override Reduction Applied:** **+15%** (of original discount)

**Adjusted Zero-Traction Discount:**
- Original discount: -55%
- Override reduction: 15% of 55% = 8.25%
- Adjusted discount: -55% + 8.25% = **-46.75%**

### Reality Check Summary

| Line Item | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Pre-Reality Check Range (Triangulated)** | $1.4M - $2.2M |
| Phase 1a Modifiers (v2.2 Updated) | -5% |
| Pre-Reality Check with Modifiers | $1.33M - $2.09M |
| Zero-Traction Discount (after override) | -46.75% |
| Idea-Stage Cap | $400K - $600K |
| Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty (E3) | -10% |
| **Post-Reality Check Range** | **$400K - $600K** |

**Reality Check Calculation (v2.2 Updated):**

1. **Pre-Reality Check Range:** $1.4M (Berkus) to $2.2M (Scorecard)
2. **Apply Phase 1a Modifiers (-5%):** *(Updated from -15.5% - Section B removed per v2.2)*
   - Berkus: $1.4M × 0.95 = $1.33M
   - Scorecard: $2.2M × 0.95 = $2.09M
3. **Apply Zero-Traction Discount (-46.75%):**
   - Berkus: $1.33M × 0.5325 = $708K
   - Scorecard: $2.09M × 0.5325 = $1.11M
4. **Apply Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty (-10%):** *(E3 for zero-traction deals)*
   - Berkus: $708K × 0.90 = $637K
   - Scorecard: $1.11M × 0.90 = $1.0M
5. **Apply Idea-Stage Cap ($400K - $600K):**
   - Final Range: **$400K - $600K** (capped)

**Reality Check Notes:**
- Zero traction is the dominant factor - no paying customers means the valuation is fundamentally capped
- Founder's domain expertise provides some override, but not enough to overcome zero traction
- MVP exists but is buggy and not validated - closer to "MVP, no/few users" cap
- Conservative range given founder overwhelm and $20K already burned with limited results
- v2.2 Update: Section B removed (only applies to deals WITH traction); Section E3 now captures market-fit penalties

---

### F. Ownership Sanity Check — NEW (v2.2)

*This is a "bounding box" check - not a valuation method, but a reality test that compares framework output against market expectations based on round size and dilution.*

#### Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Founder's Stated Raise** | Unknown (actively fundraising for December events) |
| **Estimated Raise (typical pre-seed)** | $250K - $500K (angel-only) |
| **Expected Dilution Range** | 5% - 15% (AU/NZ pre-seed angel) |
| **Implied Pre-Money (low)** | $1.42M (at $250K / 15% dilution) |
| **Implied Pre-Money (mid)** | $2.25M (at $250K / 10% dilution) |
| **Implied Pre-Money (high)** | $4.75M (at $500K / 10% dilution) |
| **Framework Valuation Range** | $400K - $600K |
| **Alignment Status** | **Gap** - Framework 60-75% below implied |

#### Sanity Check Calculation

Assuming founder seeks typical AU pre-seed angel raise:

**Scenario A: $250K raise**
- At 10% dilution: $250K / 0.10 - $250K = **$2.25M pre-money**
- At 15% dilution: $250K / 0.15 - $250K = **$1.42M pre-money**

**Scenario B: $500K raise**
- At 10% dilution: $500K / 0.10 - $500K = **$4.5M pre-money**
- At 15% dilution: $500K / 0.15 - $500K = **$2.83M pre-money**

**Gap Analysis:**
- Framework range: $400K - $600K
- Market-implied range: $1.42M - $4.5M (depending on raise size and dilution)
- Gap: Framework is **60-85% below** market implied

#### Implications

| Scenario | Status | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Framework range overlaps with implied | [ ] Aligned | Proceed with confidence |
| **Framework range is 50%+ below implied** | [x] **Gap** | Founder expectations likely high OR raise too large for stage |
| Framework range is 50%+ above implied | [ ] Overvalued | Founder undervaluing OR raise too small |

**Ownership Sanity Check Conclusion:**

The **Gap** between framework valuation ($400K-$600K) and market-implied pre-money ($1.4M-$4.5M) suggests:

1. **If founder expects market-rate valuation:** They will likely be disappointed by framework-based valuation. Need to reset expectations OR wait for traction before raising.

2. **If founder needs $250K+:** At framework valuation ($500K pre-money), a $250K raise would require ~33% dilution - significantly higher than market norms (10-15%).

3. **Recommended path forward:**
   - Smaller raise ($50K-$100K from F&F/angels) at framework valuation
   - OR defer fundraising until 3-month sprint shows traction
   - OR accept higher dilution given zero-traction reality

**Sachee-ism:** *"An idea without proof is a wish, not a business"* - Zero-traction companies face a natural dilution premium.

## 6. GTM Readiness Assessment

| Component | Score (1-10) | Weight | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|--------|----------|-------|
| ICP Clarity | 4/10 | 15% | 0.6 | Two segments defined (diaspora + architects) but not validated; which geographies first? |
| Sales Process Documentation | 1/10 | 15% | 0.15 | Nothing documented; "in founder's head"; proposed manual process not yet tested |
| Pipeline Predictability | 1/10 | 15% | 0.15 | No pipeline; organic inbound only; no system |
| CAC Clarity | 1/10 | 10% | 0.1 | Unknown - no paying customers to calculate CAC |
| Conversion Rates | 1/10 | 10% | 0.1 | Unknown - no sales process to track conversion |
| Repeatable Channel | 2/10 | 15% | 0.3 | Organic inbound exists but not systematic; word of mouth only |
| Win/Loss Analysis | 1/10 | 10% | 0.1 | No wins to analyze; losses not tracked |
| Competitive Positioning | 4/10 | 10% | 0.4 | "Trust layer + operating system" positioning developed but not tested in market |
| **TOTAL** | **15/80** | 100% | **1.9** | **~24/100** (normalized: 15/80 × 100) |

**GTM Stage:** **Chaos (0-25)** - Founder doing everything ad hoc; no system

| GTM Score | Modifier |
|-----------|----------|
| **0-25 (Chaos)** | **-20%** |
| 25-50 (Emerging) | 0% |
| 50-75 (Investable) | +15% |
| 75-100 (Scale-ready) | +30% |

**GTM Readiness Modifier:** **-20%**

*Note: This modifier is already partially captured in the Phase 1a modifiers and zero-traction discount. For final triangulation, we apply the more severe discount which is already reflected in Reality Check.*

## 7. Valuation Triangulation (v2.2 Updated)

| Method | Raw Value | After Modifiers | After Reality Check |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Berkus | $1,434K | $1,362K | $637K → Capped at $600K |
| Scorecard | $2,183K | $2,074K | $1,000K → Capped at $600K |

**Modifiers Applied (v2.2):**
- Phase 1a Modifier: -5% *(Updated from -15.5% - Section B not applied per v2.2)*
- GTM Readiness Modifier: -20% (subsumed in zero-traction discount)
- **Combined Modifier (pre-Reality Check):** -5%

**Reality Check Applied:**
- Zero-Traction Discount: -46.75% (after +15% override for domain expertise)
- Idea-Stage Cap: $400K - $600K
- Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty (E3): -10% *(replaces Section B for zero-traction)*
- Override Reduction: +15% (deep domain expert)

**Pre-Reality Check Range (v2.2):** $1.36M - $2.07M
**Final Triangulated Range:** **$400K - $600K pre-money** *(Updated from $300K-$500K)*

*Note: The upper end of the range increases from $500K to $600K under v2.2 because:*
1. *Section B (-10.5%) no longer applies - only Section E3 (-10%) applies for zero-traction deals*
2. *This results in less total penalty, but the Idea-Stage Cap ($400K-$600K) remains the binding constraint*

*Using conservative end of Idea-Stage Cap given:*
- Zero revenue, zero customers
- MVP buggy and needs work
- Founder overwhelm risk
- $20K already burned with limited results
- Unknown if 3-month sprint will produce traction

**Founder Expectation:** Unknown (actively fundraising for December events)
**Gap:** TBD - Likely significant if founder expects typical pre-seed range

| Gap | Status |
|-----|--------|
| <15% | Aligned |
| 15-50% | Needs Calibration |
| >50% | Misaligned |

*If founder expects $1M+ (typical Phase 1a range), gap would be 50-100%+ = **Misaligned***

## 9. Key Risks

1. **Founder Overwhelm (HIGH):**
   - Solo founder taking on dev + marketing + PM + sales
   - Let entire team go - suggests delegation/management issues
   - "Going through a lot right now" - personal capacity concerns
   - Unsustainable workload may lead to burnout before traction

2. **Zero Traction / No Validation (HIGH):**
   - No paying customers despite 1.4 years of development
   - $20K spent "almost in vain" on technology
   - Organic inbound exists but hasn't converted to revenue
   - Two-sided marketplace chicken-and-egg not systematically addressed

3. **Product-Market Fit Uncertainty (MEDIUM-HIGH):**
   - Platform has significant UX issues (mobile, clutter, location filter)
   - Stripped down MVP not yet validated
   - Manual matching model not yet proven (3-5 test matches needed)
   - Technology may need complete rebuild

4. **Market/Geographic Risk (MEDIUM):**
   - Sri Lanka market dynamics uncertain (economic situation)
   - Diaspora in AU/UK/CAN - cultural barriers to selling remotely
   - Fragmented construction industry - hard to scale

5. **Fundraising Pressure (MEDIUM):**
   - December events suggest pitch deadlines
   - Fundraising may distract from execution
   - If valuation expectations misaligned, may shop deal and delay focus

## 10. Pattern Recognition

**Identified Patterns:**
- [x] Pattern 1: Great Product, Weak GTM - Product exists but no GTM motion
- [ ] Pattern 2: Random Wins, No Pattern - N/A (no wins yet)
- [x] Pattern 3: Founder Can't Sell - Relies on inbound, avoids active selling
- [x] Pattern 4: Valuation Expectations Misaligned - Likely (actively fundraising at Phase 1a with zero traction)
- [x] Pattern 5: Too Early for VCs - Definitely too early
- [x] Pattern 6: Premature Scaling - $20K spent on platform before validating sales motion; hired team before PMF

**Pattern Notes:**

**Classic Phase 1a Trajectory:**
Over-built → burned cash → forced simplification → back to basics

This is exactly what ArcheloLab has experienced:
1. Built complex platform with multiple features
2. Spent $20K and 1.4 years
3. Received feedback that platform was cluttered
4. Let team go, simplified to MVP
5. Now returning to founder-led, manual-first approach

**Premature Scaling (Pattern 6) - Most Relevant:**
Ain hired developers and marketing before validating the core value proposition. The $20K lesson is expensive but he's showing self-awareness. The question is: Can he execute the simplified plan without trying to do too much again?

**Founder Can't Sell (Pattern 3) - Partial:**
Ain gets organic inbound but hasn't actively closed deals. The manual matching model proposes he do personal outreach and matching, but he's also spread across dev/marketing/PM. Selling capability scored 2.5/5.

## 11. Next Steps

- [ ] Pass (with feedback)
- [ ] Tier 2 diagnostic (schedule calls) - Already completed
- [x] Advisory proposal - Continue pro-bono through 3-month sprint
- [ ] Investment discussion - Not yet
- [ ] VC intro memo - Not ready
- [x] Check back in 3 months (March 2025)

**Specific Actions:**
1. **Complete December call (Dec 5, 8:30am SL time):** Review 3-month sprint goals, success metrics
2. **Test platform:** Provide UX feedback on simplified archelolab.com
3. **Define success criteria for March 2025:**
   - 3-5 manual matches completed
   - At least 1 paying customer (even small fee)
   - Documented sales process
   - GTM Readiness score ≥35
4. **March 2025 re-assessment:** If criteria met, consider:
   - Paid advisory engagement (GTM Diagnostic)
   - Updated valuation analysis
   - Potential VC introduction path

## Notes & Observations

**Dual Relationship Complexity:**
Ain is also helping with Sachee's parents' house renovation in Sri Lanka. This creates both opportunity (real platform test case, natural touchpoints) and risk (mixing personal/business). Keep conversations clearly separated.

**Founder Assessment:**
Ain is smart, well-connected, and has domain expertise. But he's spread thin and may have overestimated his ability to delegate (team didn't work out). The $20K lesson was expensive but he's showing self-awareness. Key question: Can he execute the simplified plan without trying to do too much again?

**Advisory Value Being Delivered:**
Even without formal engagement, significant value provided:
- Positioning framework + worksheet
- Platform UX feedback as real user
- Strategic advice on simplification
- Accountability structure (weekly/monthly calls)
- 90-day planning framework

**Sachee-isms Relevant to This Deal:**
- *"Do things that don't scale"* - Manual matching first, tech later
- *"Save the cheerleader, save the world"* - Pick one diaspora market (Australia) and dominate
- *"Speed is our weapon"* - 3-month sprint to prove/disprove, then decide
- *"An idea without proof is a wish, not a business"* - Zero traction = zero validation

## 12. Valuation Change Log

### v2.2 Framework Re-Analysis (2025-12-03)

**Changes from initial analysis (same date):**

| Change | v2.1 Value | v2.2 Value | Rationale |
|--------|------------|------------|-----------|
| Section B Applied | -10.5% | 0% (removed) | Section B only applies to deals WITH traction |
| Section E3 Applied | -10% | -10% | No change - correctly applied for zero-traction |
| Phase 1a Modifier | -15.5% | -5% | Section B removed from calculation |
| Final Range | $300K-$500K | $400K-$600K | Less penalty, but Idea-Stage Cap still binding |

| AI Premium | +$100K (not met) | +$200K-$400K (0/3 criteria) | Updated criteria, still not applicable |

**Key v2.2 Framework Updates Applied:**
1. Section B vs E3 clarified: E3 only for zero-traction, B for deals with traction
2. Variable Penalty by Sales Complexity added to E3 assessment
3. Section F (Ownership Sanity Check) added - reveals expectation gap
4. AI Premium criteria updated (must meet 2/3 criteria)
5. Framework version updated to 2.2
