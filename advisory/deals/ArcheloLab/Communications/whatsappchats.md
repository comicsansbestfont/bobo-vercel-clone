**Ainharan:** [Quoting Sachee: "hey mate thats awesome..."]
Hey, try to do with the phone itself. Because of you only I was able to find a bug that need a fix. So, Just try with mobile when you have time. Also, share the experience
[Quoting Sachee: "by the way, when do you want to go..."]
I have already done. Now getting ready for some events coming up in December. You let me know a time, anytime, I can and want to do 😃

**07/11/2026**

**Ainharan:** Hey, how are you doing man? Did you get a chance to look into the product?
Also, let me know what sort of a timeline you are looking at with your project? I mean, when do you want to Start and etc
I am working on the initial sketch now

**Sachee:** [Quoting Ainharan: "...Now getting ready for some events coming up in December..."]
can we catchup monday at 12:30pm? colombo time
[Quoting Ainharan: "Hey, how are you doing man? Did you get a chance to look into the product?"]
nope not yet. will try to do today
[Quoting Ainharan: "Also, let me know what sort of a timeline you are looking at with your project?..."]
will need to bring dad into the equation here, what are our next steps - budget will need to come in early for review

**Ainharan:** [Quoting Sachee: "can we catchup monday at 12:30pm? colombo time"]
Sure, I will share the meeting link. In fact, I will open up my timing on the platform and you can boom directly through the platform.
[Quoting Sachee: "nope not yet. will try to do today"]
Yes pls. That would be a great help
[Quoting Sachee: "will need to bring dad into the equation here..."]
Yes, I will get the design done and then the budget. Let's discuss on Mondat

**Sachee:** hey man submitted but then i got this error
[Image: Screenshot of error message "Oops..."]
Ah, Issue is, It's reading the location and Noone is in Aus. So, basically, you have to switch off your location so it shows professionals from Sri Lanka

**Sachee:** when you say turn off the location, are you meaning like a VPN?

**Ainharan:** No.
Click on the filter more button on the right top hand corner
Then you will see location.
Select hybrid or remote
Or else when you log in
[Image: Screenshot of filter menu "37 kB"]
You should have selected
Never allow
[Quoting Ainharan: "Click on the filter more button on the right top hand corner"]
You should have selected
Never allow
[Quoting Ainharan: "Click on the filter more button on the right top hand corner"]
This is the best way

**Sachee:** I would simplify this process to make it just give the user the option to select the location. feels unnecessary

**Ainharan:** That's true
It is at the wrong time I guess, I future, It will be a good feature but at this point, I guess, It's complicating the process. I will go for some updates
Hi, just check it out and hire me through the platform when you get some time pls

**Sachee:** i just logged in, and i can't find the request i created. does that mean i need to submit it again?

**Ainharan:** You didn't hire anyone after filling that form right? If so, you will not be able to and have to do again, but, If you at least hired one person, then, you can use the same to hire more.

**Sachee:** okii, sorry man i feel like an idiot. i cant figure out how to then off the location stuff on my phone. im on iphone and tried safari/chrome

**Ainharan:** Hey bro, that's actually helping me as I want something super easy for anyone to use. Even a person like you , who is from startup background find it some issues, It's kind of an alarm for me
Are we meeting at 12.30 today?
If so, try to book the meeting via the platform
If it's too difficult, then let's connect outside

**Sachee:** ah shit, i didn't have it in my calendar. was that 12:30 Sri Lanka time?
can you find a time that works for you here
[Link Shared: Calendly]

**Ainharan:** Yes
Sure
Will do
Hey bro, actually, you only had 12 noon available for today but I will be finishing a meeting around that time hence, I have booked a time for tomorrow at 11

**Sachee:** thanks mate. appreciate it - it wasn't in my calendar so i completely missed it.

**Ainharan:** No worries.
Talk to you tomorrow then
In the meantime, check the web and share as much as flaws you can. That will help me a lot.
I have taken some tough decisions too
Long story, maybe will chat on those tomorrow or some other time.

**Ainharan:** Likewise! See you tomorrow

Sorry to keep on pushing this, can you pls try to book me from the platform and share your comments
Also, this will help me to see some projects actually routing through the platform as a case studies
Thanks bro, I have accepted the project. Will share the next step ASAP.

**Sachee:** sorry bro was stuck deep in code last two days testing out the new gemini and didnt do much outside of that
ive gone and done your thing

**Ainharan:** [Quoting Sachee: "ive gone and done your thing"]
Yes mate, got the mail.
Hi mate, how are you doing? Just want to let you know that, Is it ok to Start your project from next week? Little stuck with so many things going on, including the staffs and other things.
Give me till next week and I will get it sorted out.

**24/12/2026**

**Sachee:** hey man, when you say start the project next week are you talking about the scoping and the costing and stuff? have you been liaising with my dad to get all the details and is he in the loop? as i said ideally you're running everything through him and then looping me in.

**Ainharan:** Hey, sure. No problem. I will do it. Yes, it will be the revised design with the costing

**25/12/2026**

**Sachee:** hey matey, let's put together a fortnightly catch-up in our calendars for you to go through stuff with me. just a half an hour if you can. also, give me your back-of-the-envelope 3-month plan and goal between now and, say, the end of February

**Ainharan:** Hey bro. Thanks for the message. Just quick update, after the current "turmoil " things am going on, I have changed some plans. So, my plans are as below:
Pre-bagging- 15th Nov to 30th Nov
Offensive Strategy - 3rd December to 3rd March ( this is the 3 months plan)
I will share an email by tonight to you
Also, shall we have a fixed time on monthly basis for us to have this call? I mean, first Thursday of each month and something like that?

**Sachee:** hey man hope youre staying safe and well
hopefully not to affected by the floods?
sure — lets do a monthly call. just next week ill be on a plane on thursday but can do friday
i put a time in your calendar for friday let me know if that works. lets do this for the 3 month sprint. do you think you can prep the goals in more detail and what particular outcomes we can use to track success

**Ainharan:** Sounds good. You mean from 5th of December? Sth, I have this event from morning 9 to evening 5. So, I am ok after 7 pm SL time. I am good with doing this every Friday. If we can keep a regular timing like that, it would be great
Yes, I will share the complete plan by this Tuesday. I am having some trouble as I have lost my wallet with ID, Licence and etc. So Monday and Tuesday will be stuck with dealing with the government organization
Let me know about the timing on Friday

**Sachee:** oh dear thats no good
hope it all gets sorted
i won't be able to do after 7pm Sri Lanka time because that would be like 9 or 10 my time. maybe let's push it back to the following week. i will send you a couple of times that work. i'll be in the middle of a conference, so i am going to be a bit tight

**Ainharan:** Yes, sorting out one by one. You know, here these things are hectic processes. You have to go in person , after least twice to get one thing done. So, it's really a annoying and complicated
Process
[Quoting Sachee: "i won't be able to do after 7pm Sri Lanka time..."]
Sure. I can understand. Let me know your free times. But I prefer Fridays to have a chat with you. Ideally, anytime between 2 to 5 pm SL time. If you are available, we can fix that. However, for this month, will have an alternative date. Let me know your availability

**Ainharan:** Hey bro, the event has been called off due to the emergency situation. Hence, we can have our call as planned on this Friday at 8.30 am SL time

**Sachee:** hey man thanks. sorry i didnt get yr reply earlier, was trying to find another time but couldnt make it work
cool

**Ainharan:** No, we can go ahead with the time. I have already accepted it. So see you on Friday at 8.30 am IST
