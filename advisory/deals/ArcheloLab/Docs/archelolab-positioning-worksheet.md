## Part 1: Demand Side Positioning (Diaspora Clients)

### Step 1: Define Your Target Customer

**Who is your primary customer?** (Be brutally specific)

*Examples: "Sri Lankan diaspora in Australia", "Property owners living overseas", "Australian-Sri Lankans aged 30-55"*

```
For _______________________________________________________________
    (specific customer segment - geography, demographics, context)

who _______________________________________________________________
    (what are they trying to do? what's their situation?)

and _______________________________________________________________
    (what's their main frustration/constraint?)
```

**Test your specificity:** If someone reads this, would they immediately know if it's for them? Yes / No

---

### Step 2: Choose Your Market Category

What "mental bucket" should customers put you in?

**Select one:**
- [ ] Expert matching service for diaspora
- [ ] Remote construction management platform
- [ ] Architecture marketplace
- [ ] Other: _______________________________

**Why did you choose this?**

```
___________________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________________
```

---

### Step 3: Articulate Your Key Benefit

What's the primary outcome you deliver? (Focus on outcomes, not features)

**Complete this:**

```
Archelo Lab delivers _______________________________________________
                      (what's the specific outcome?)

within _____________________________________________________________
       (timeframe - 24 hours? 48 hours? 1 week?)

so you can _________________________________________________________
            (what does this enable them to do?)

without ____________________________________________________________
         (what pain point does this eliminate?)
```

**Example:** "Archelo Lab delivers 3 vetted architect recommendations within 24 hours so you can start your project with confidence without relying on unreliable relatives or flying back to Sri Lanka repeatedly."

---

### Step 4: Define Your Primary Competitive Alternative

What do customers do TODAY when they have this problem? (Be realistic about actual behavior, not ideal solutions)

**Rank these from most common (1) to least common (5):**

- [ ] Ask relatives or friends in Sri Lanka to find and manage architects
- [ ] Post in diaspora Facebook groups asking for recommendations
- [ ] Hire someone through personal connections
- [ ] Fly back to Sri Lanka repeatedly to manage in person
- [ ] Google "architects in Sri Lanka" and contact them directly

**The most common alternative is:** (this is what you're positioning against)

```
___________________________________________________________________
```

---

### Step 5: State Your Primary Differentiation

What makes you materially different from the alternative above?

**Complete this using the 4-part test:**

```
Unlike __________________________________________________________,
        (the primary alternative from Step 4)

Archelo Lab _____________________________________________________
                 (what do you do differently?)

because _________________________________________________________
         (why can you do this? what's your advantage?)

which means _____________________________________________________
             (what's the tangible benefit to the customer?)
```

**Check against these criteria:**
- [ ] TRUE: You can actually deliver this today
- [ ] PROVABLE: You can demonstrate it with testimonials/guarantees
- [ ] VALUABLE: Customers care deeply about this
- [ ] DEFENSIBLE: Hard for competitors to easily copy

---

### Step 6: Complete Positioning Statement (Demand Side)

**Now put it all together:**

```
For ____________________________________________________________
    (from Step 1)

who ____________________________________________________________
    (from Step 1)

Archelo Lab is a ________________________________________________
                  (from Step 2 - market category)

that ____________________________________________________________
     (from Step 3 - key benefit)

Unlike __________________________________________________________
        (from Step 4 - primary alternative)

we _____________________________________________________________
    (from Step 5 - primary differentiation)
```

---

### Step 7: One-Sentence Version (Demand Side)

Distill the above into ONE sentence for your website/marketing:

```
___________________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________________
```

**Example:** "Building a home in Sri Lanka from abroad? Get 3 vetted architect recommendations in 24 hours—no unreliable relatives required."

**Test:** Read this to someone unfamiliar with your business. Can they:
- [ ] Immediately know if it's for them?
- [ ] Understand what you do?
- [ ] See how you're different?

---

## Part 2: Supply Side Positioning (Architects)

### Step 1: Define Your Target Customer

**Who is your primary architect/designer customer?** (Be specific)

```
For _______________________________________________________________
    (experience level, location, specialty)

who _______________________________________________________________
    (what are they trying to achieve in their business?)

and _______________________________________________________________
    (what's their main frustration with getting clients?)
```

---

### Step 2: Articulate Your Key Benefit (Supply Side)

What's the primary outcome you deliver to architects?

**Complete this:**

```
Archelo Lab provides _______________________________________________
                       (what do architects get?)

that _______________________________________________________________
     (what's the quality/characteristic of these leads?)

so they can ________________________________________________________
             (what does this enable them to do?)

without ____________________________________________________________
         (what frustration does this eliminate?)
```

**Example:** "Archelo Lab provides pre-qualified diaspora leads with confirmed budgets so architects can focus on design work without wasting time on tire-kickers or price shoppers."

---

### Step 3: Define Your Primary Competitive Alternative (Supply Side)

What do architects do TODAY to find clients?

**Rank from most common (1) to least common (4):**

- [ ] Wait for word-of-mouth referrals from past clients
- [ ] Maintain social media presence (Instagram/Facebook) hoping for inquiries
- [ ] Network at industry events
- [ ] Pay for ads or directory listings

**The most common alternative is:**

```
___________________________________________________________________
```

---

### Step 4: State Your Primary Differentiation (Supply Side)

```
Unlike __________________________________________________________,
        (primary alternative)

Archelo Lab _____________________________________________________
                 (what's different about your leads?)

because _________________________________________________________
         (why are they better quality?)

which means _____________________________________________________
             (benefit to the architect)
```

---

### Step 5: Complete Positioning Statement (Supply Side)

```
For ____________________________________________________________
    (from Step 1)

who ____________________________________________________________
    (from Step 1)

Archelo Lab is a ________________________________________________
                  (curated lead service? professional network?)

that ____________________________________________________________
     (from Step 2 - key benefit)

Unlike __________________________________________________________
        (from Step 3 - primary alternative)

we _____________________________________________________________
    (from Step 4 - primary differentiation)
```

---

### Step 6: One-Sentence Version (Supply Side)

```
___________________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________________
```

---

## Part 3: Focus Decision

**Given limited time and resources, which side should be your PRIMARY focus for the next 90 days?**

- [ ] Demand Side (Diaspora Clients) - 80% of effort
- [ ] Supply Side (Architects) - 80% of effort
- [ ] Equal split (not recommended for MVP)

**Why?**

```
___________________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________________
```

**Recommendation from strategy call:** Focus 80% on demand side (diaspora) because you can't have a two-sided marketplace without solving one side first. Once you have consistent demand, supply will follow.

---

## Part 4: Positioning Validation

Answer these honestly:

**1. Can you explain what you do in ONE sentence at a dinner party?**

```
___________________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________________
```

**2. If someone asks "Is this for me?", would they know within 5 seconds?**

Yes / No

If no, your positioning isn't specific enough. Go back to Part 1, Step 1.

**3. Can you deliver on your positioning promise TODAY (manually if needed)?**

Yes / No

If no, revise your benefit statement to reflect MVP reality.

**4. What's the ONE thing that makes you different that competitors can't easily copy?**

```
___________________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________________
```

**5. What's the emotional pain point you solve?** (Beyond rational benefits)

```
For diaspora: _____________________________________________________

For architects: ____________________________________________________
```
