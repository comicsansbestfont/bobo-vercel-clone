## 2. Deep Research

### 2.1 Company Background
> ArcheloLab is a Sri Lankan construction/architecture tech startup founded by Ainharan Vivekananthan. Originally conceived as a two-sided marketplace, the company has evolved its positioning to:
>
> **Current Positioning (Nov 2025):**
> *"ArcheloLAB is the trust layer and operating system for residential construction. It matches homeowners with the right architect, protects collaboration, and ensures a transparent, stress-free homebuilding journey."*
>
> **Two customer segments:**
> 1. **Demand side (Homeowners):** Sri Lankan diaspora in Australia, UK, Canada who want to build/renovate in Sri Lanka remotely
> 2. **Supply side (Architects):** Sri Lankan architects/interior designers seeking qualified clients with confirmed budgets
>
> **Founder background:**
> - UK experience/education (BEng Hons)
> - Mentor at Founders Institute Sri Lanka
> - Runs a construction business in Sri Lanka (domain expertise)
> - 1 year 4 months in development as of Nov 2025

### 2.2 Market & Industry
> **Vertical:** Construction tech / Diaspora services / Two-sided marketplace
>
> **Target diaspora markets:** Australia, Canada, UK
>
> **Market pain points identified (from strategy call):**
> - Diaspora can't be physically present at construction sites
> - Don't trust relatives to manage projects (unreliable)
> - No visibility into project progress
> - Fear of being ripped off
> - Don't know how to find reliable architects/contractors
>
> **Industry dynamics:**
> - Construction in Sri Lanka is highly fragmented
> - Low digitization in the industry
> - Relationship-driven, not platform-driven
> - Different time zones require async communication

### 2.3 Product/Service
> **Current state (post-simplification, Nov 2025):**
> - Stripped down MVP live at archelolab.com
> - Simplified form-based intake
> - Manual architect matching by Ain (24-hour turnaround promised)
> - Focus on "simple and lovable" per Sachee's Lovability Pyramid
>
> **Previous issues (pre-Nov 2025):**
> - Platform had too many features, nothing complete
> - Desktop-focused but 90% of users on mobile
> - Cluttered with chatbots, pop-ups, social share widgets
> - Location filter defaulting to GPS (showing no results for overseas users)
> - Booking flow confusing - users couldn't find created requests
> - Old technology stack, terrible UX
>
> **Product evolution:**
> - Original MVP: archfolio.club (Oct 2025)
> - Current: archelolab.com (Nov 2025, simplified)
>
> **Value proposition pitch:**
> *"Finding the right architect is hard. Managing construction is harder. ArcheloLAB does both. We match you with curated architects, protect the collaboration, and handle timelines, payments, updates, and site coordination. You get a stress-free homebuilding journey. Architects get qualified clients and fewer headaches."*

### 2.4 Business Model
> **Still pre-revenue** - monetization model unclear
>
> Potential models discussed:
> - Commission on architect/builder connections (marketplace take rate)
> - Project management fees
> - Transaction fees on payments
>
> **Key insight from Nov 11 call:**
> Ain already operates successfully manually in Colombo (consultations, architect matching, project management). Tech is only needed for scalability beyond Colombo.

### 2.5 Growth Signals
> **Concerning signals:**
> - $20,000 USD spent "almost in vain" on development
> - Let entire team go (Nov 2025) - suggests hiring/delegation issues
> - Referenced "turmoil" in December communications
> - Founder taking on dev + marketing + PM simultaneously (overwhelm risk)
> - Actively fundraising but December events suggest pitch deadlines
>
> **Positive signals:**
> - Getting organic inbound projects despite platform issues
> - People finding Ain online (word of mouth working)
> - Founder receptive to feedback ("It's kind of an alarm for me")
> - Completed positioning exercise quickly
> - Launched simplified MVP within weeks of feedback
> - Structured 3-month execution plan (Dec-Mar)
> - Action bias - "jumped into action plan straight away"

### 2.6 Key Stakeholders
> **Ainharan Vivekananthan (Ain Haran) - Founder/CEO**
> - UK background/education (BEng Hons)
> - Mentor at Founders Institute Sri Lanka
> - Runs a construction business (domain expertise)
> - Now solo founder after letting team go
> - Taking on technology, marketing, and PM personally
> - "A bit up himself" but receptive to direct feedback
> - "Going through a lot right now" (Nov 2025)
>
> **Team (as of Nov 2025):**
> - Previous: Local developers + marketing person (all let go)
> - Current: 1 contractor on task-based (not monthly salary)
> - Ain handling dev, marketing, PM personally

### 2.7 Competitive Landscape
> **Primary competitive alternative (what diaspora do today):**
> 1. Ask relatives in Sri Lanka to manage everything (most common)
> 2. Post in diaspora Facebook groups for recommendations
> 3. Fly back repeatedly to manage in person
> 4. Hire through personal connections
> 5. Google and contact architects directly
>
> **Positioning against alternatives:**
> - For Clients: "Why use Archelo Lab instead of asking a relative in Sri Lanka to find an architect?"
> - For Architects: "Why join Archelo Lab instead of relying on referrals or social media?"
>
> **Differentiation (per new positioning):**
> - Trust layer (vetting, protection)
> - End-to-end journey management (not just matching)
> - Coordination infrastructure (timelines, payments, updates, site coordination)

### 2.8 TLDR
- **Positioning evolved:** From generic marketplace to "trust layer and operating system for residential construction"
- **Team pivoted:** Let everyone go, now solo founder + 1 contractor after burning $20K
- **Platform simplified:** Stripped unnecessary features, MVP live at archelolab.com
- **Clear customer segments:** Diaspora (AUS/UK/CAN) + Sri Lankan architects
- **Manual first:** Tech not needed for Colombo ops, only for scale
- **Organic traction:** Getting inbound projects despite broken platform
- **Advisory relationship:** Monthly calls established, 3-month sprint (Dec-Mar)
- **Red flag:** Founder taking on too much (dev + marketing + PM), "going through a lot"

---

## 3. GTM Assessment

### Current State (as of Nov 2025)
> **Founder-led everything:**
> - Ain personally handling: development, marketing, project management, sales
> - Manual architect matching process working in Colombo
> - Simplified platform launched (archelolab.com)
> - No team support after letting developers and marketing person go
>
> **Go-to-market motion:**
> - Organic inbound from online presence
> - Platform as validation tool (using real projects as case studies)
> - Geographic expansion planned: Australia → Canada → UK

### What's Working
> - Organic project inflow (people finding Ain online)
> - Manual operations model validated in Colombo
> - Clear understanding of two customer segments
> - Founder has domain expertise (runs construction business)
> - Networks: Founders Institute mentor, diaspora community
> - Positioning clarity achieved (trust layer + operating system)
> - Action bias - rapid iteration after feedback

### What's Broken / Pain Points
> - **Founder overwhelm:** Taking on dev + marketing + PM = unsustainable
> - **Burn rate lessons:** $20K spent before PMF (classic mistake)
> - **Team failure:** Entire team let go - hiring/delegation issues or premature scaling
> - **Mobile UX:** 90% of users on mobile but platform was desktop-focused
> - **Technology debt:** Built on old stack, clunky UX
> - **Two-sided marketplace:** Still hasn't solved chicken-and-egg systematically
> - **Case studies needed:** Platform validation requires projects routed through it

### Immediate Goals (90-Day Sprint: Dec 2025 - Mar 2026)
> **Ain's 3-month plan structure:**
> - **Pre-bagging:** Nov 15-30 (completed)
> - **Offensive Strategy:** Dec 3 - Mar 3
>
> **Focus areas:**
> 1. Getting clients (primary)
> 2. Taking on marketing personally
> 3. Taking on project management personally
> 4. Adding "one more feature in a very different way, keeping it simple and lovable"
>
> **Sachee's recommended approach:**
> 1. Run 3-5 manual matches to validate workflow
> 2. Single form → 24-hour custom recommendation promise
> 3. Build tech only after proving manual process works
> 4. Strip remaining complexity from platform

### Strategic Goals (12 months)
> TBD - need to validate basic assumptions first
>
> **Likely trajectory if successful:**
> - Prove manual matching model (3-5 projects)
> - Build case studies from real projects
> - Layer in technology for scale
> - Geographic expansion (AUS → CAN → UK)

## 4. Meeting Notes

*Extracted from /Meetings folder. Add new meetings at top.*

### November 11, 2025 - Strategy Session (Google Meet)
**Attendees:** Sachee Perera, Ain Haran
**Duration:** ~25 minutes (business portion)
**Type:** Advisory call (mixed with house renovation discussion)

**Key Discussion:**

**Platform Complexity & Feature Overload:**
- Platform has too many features that aren't fully functional
- "The product is kind of touched everywhere but nothing is complete for somebody to get a complete feeling"
- Desktop-focused but 90% of users accessing via mobile
- Pop-ups, chatbots, Facebook shares creating friction
- Sachee had difficulty as a user navigating the platform

**Core Problem Identified:**
- If initial architect-client matching doesn't happen correctly, everything downstream fails
- Platform currently shows ALL architects instead of personalized matches
- Ain's unique value is his insight on requirements (done offline)
- Tech should support this expertise, not replace it

**Manual vs. Tech Operations:**
- Ain already operates successfully manually in Colombo
- "While I'm in Colombo, I don't actually need the platform. But if it's the day that I wanted to scale it up, only I need another platform."
- Tech is ONLY needed for scalability beyond Colombo

**Time & Investment Reality Check:**
- 1 year 4 months spent on platform development
- Significant money invested
- Ain acknowledges: "I know it's nearly one year and four months being wasted and a lot of money being put on it, but at least now the time is to get back to the right part of doing it."

**Sachee's Advice Given:**
1. **"Pick one or two workflows and optimize just for that"** - Stop trying to solve everything
2. **"Could replicate everything with Google Forms or Typeform"** - Try to solve without software first
3. **"Do it manually first (3-5 matchings)"** - Understand process before building workflows
4. **"Remove complexity and hyper-focus"** - Get crystal clear on core problem
5. **"Positioning and messaging work needed"** - Will improve conversion
6. **"Keep it simple, man. Keep it simple."**

**Proposed New Flow (Accepted):**
1. Single form captures all information
2. Email notification to Ain
3. Ain manually reviews and selects 3-4 matching architects
4. Reply to customer: "Here are your custom recommendations"
5. **Timeline commitment:** Custom recommendation within 24 hours

**Ain's Response:**
- "I'm a bit ashamed to say... this is where things went wrong with my project management"
- Acknowledges giving developers big picture without proper prioritization
- "I really wanted to create this complete ecosystem" - now realizes MVP shouldn't solve everything
- "At least now the time is to get back to the right part of doing it"
- Requested weekly check-ins for accountability

**Action Items Agreed:**
- [ ] Strip down platform - remove unnecessary features
- [ ] Focus on architect recruitment
- [ ] Manual operations first while building traction
- [x] Complete positioning exercise (15-20 mins)
- [ ] Create 90-day sprint plan with top 3 priorities
- [ ] Weekly progress emails to Sachee

## 6. My Notes & Observations

### Hypotheses to Test
> 1. Can Ain sustain solo founder mode (dev + marketing + PM)?
> 2. Will 3-month sprint produce enough traction to justify paid engagement?
> 3. Is the "trust layer" positioning resonating with diaspora?
> 4. Does manual matching model convert to paying customers?
> 5. Will fundraising pressure distract from execution?

### Red Flags
> - **$20K burn pre-PMF:** Classic over-building before validation
> - **Team let go:** Hiring/delegation issues or premature scaling
> - **Founder overwhelm:** "Going through a lot right now" - taking on too much
> - **Fundraising pressure:** December events = pitch deadlines, may distract
> - **Dual relationship:** Also helping with Sachee's parents' house - could complicate advisory
> - **Technology choices:** 1 year 4 months on platform that may need rebuild
> - **"Turmoil" mentioned:** Some business crisis happened (Dec)

### Opportunities
> - Real pain point validated (organic inbound despite broken platform)
> - Positioning clarity achieved quickly after exercise
> - Founder receptive to feedback and action-oriented
> - Manual model works in Colombo - clear path to scale
> - First mover in specific niche (Sri Lankan diaspora + construction)
> - Domain expertise (runs construction business)
> - Could become case study for "founder-led sales is permanent" thesis

### Pattern Recognition
> - **Classic Phase 1a trajectory:** Over-built → burned cash → forced simplification → back to basics
> - **Marketplace chicken-and-egg:** Still not addressing systematically (recommend demand-first)
> - **Premature scaling:** Hired team before PMF, now returning to founder-led
> - **Feature obsession → focus:** Sachee's feedback catalyzed shift to essentials
> - **Framework adoption:** Using "lovable" language from Lovability Pyramid

### Personal Notes
> **Dual relationship complexity:**
> Ain is also helping with Sachee's parents' house renovation in Sri Lanka. This creates:
> - Pro: Deep relationship, natural touchpoints, real platform test case
> - Con: Could complicate paid advisory relationship, mixing personal/business
> - Approach: Keep conversations clearly separated, use renovation as case study
>
> **Founder assessment:**
> Ain is smart, well-connected, and has domain expertise. But he's spread thin and may have overestimated his ability to delegate (team didn't work out). The $20K lesson was expensive but he's showing self-awareness. Key question: Can he execute the simplified plan without trying to do too much again?
>
> **Advisory value being delivered:**
> Even without formal engagement, significant value provided:
> - Positioning framework + worksheet
> - Platform UX feedback as real user
> - Strategic advice on simplification
> - Accountability structure (weekly/monthly calls)
> - 90-day planning framework
>
> **Potential paid engagement:**
> If 3-month sprint shows traction, could convert to:
> - GTM Diagnostic ($5-8K) - formal assessment
> - Monthly Advisory - strategic partnership
> - Or stay as informal advisor (valuable local contact regardless)
