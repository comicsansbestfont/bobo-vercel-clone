## Summary

Monthly advisory call covering Ainhanran's 90-day plan launch, development pivot to low-code tools (Lovable, Bubble IO), and go-to-market strategy for the diaspora segment. Key breakthrough on simplifying positioning from "knowledge partner" to "expert project manager" - much clearer value proposition for the target market.

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Development Pivot
- Frustrated with slow custom development spending more money with no progress
- Pivoted to Lovable and Bubble IO for faster iteration
- Goal: Complete full basic platform where complete sales can happen within platform
- Working 18-hour days to ship quickly

### 2. 90-Day Plan Structure
- **Pre-90 days** (ending Dec 5): Platform setup and preparation
- **Month 1** (Dec 6 - Jan 5): Onboard 10 diaspora clients + product validation
- **Month 2-3**: Refinement based on feedback, local professional expansion

### 3. Positioning Breakthrough
- **Before:** "Knowledge partner" - confusing, jargon-heavy
- **After:** "Expert project manager in Sri Lanka" - clear, simple
- **Core pitch:** "ArcheloLab is your trusted project manager in Sri Lanka. You can select architects and contractors through our platform, or give it all to us - we manage design to build. Everything updated online at your convenience, no matter the time difference."

### 4. Go-to-Market Strategy - Diaspora Focus
- **Primary channel:** Outbound through trusted network contacts
- **Key contacts identified:**
  - UK: CEO of previous project client (Sri Lankan diaspora connections)
  - Australia: Sachee + Janika introduction
  - Canada: Existing contact with follow-up meeting scheduled
- **New channel:** LinkedIn outbound to engaged connections
  - Filter for international profiles who've engaged with posts
  - Craft personalized outreach leveraging professional credibility

### 5. Partner Strategy Considerations
- Challenge: Early stage = partners risk reputation by referring
- Need proof points before scaling partner channel
- For now: Rely on warm introductions through trusted contacts
- Create partner introduction materials (flyer/brief)

### 6. Architect Onboarding Strategy
- Deliberately onboarding mid-range, younger architects
- Reason: More willing to work within ArcheloLab's project management framework
- Not onboarding everyone - selective for quality control

### 7. Personal Update
- Natural disaster impact in Sri Lanka (cyclone/floods)
- Jaffna house roof damaged by cyclone
- One construction project on hold (Kuliapitia area badly affected)
- Interior office projects continuing

## Sachee's Advisory Notes

### What Worked
- Elevator pitch practice exercise - forced clarity on value prop
- Identified "knowledge partner" as confusing jargon
- Unlocked LinkedIn outbound as untested channel

### Key Coaching Points Delivered
1. **Simplify messaging** - Avoid fancy terms, use plain language
2. **Customer perspective** - Put yourself in customer's shoes when pitching
3. **Problem-solution fit** - Still establishing this, need market validation
4. **Do things that don't scale** - Outbound is the right approach at this stage
5. **Test hypotheses** - LinkedIn outbound is untested, might surprise you

### Watch Points for Next Session
- Progress on 10 diaspora client goal
- LinkedIn outbound results/learnings
- Partner introduction material quality
- Platform usability feedback from early users
