## 1. Phase Classification Analysis

### Evidence for Phase Classification

| Phase Criteria | Evidence | Assessment |
|----------------|----------|------------|
| ARR in range ($0-50K) | $0 estimated (no revenue mentioned) | Yes - Phase 1a |
| Customer count (0-10) | 0 paying (case studies exist, likely pilots) | Yes - Phase 1a |
| Paying full price (not pilots) | 0 of 0 | 0% |
| Similar customers (same ICP) | Unknown - no customer data | Cannot assess |
| Describable buying motion | Not established | No |
| Could someone else close? | Sales leader hired but no closed deals | Unlikely |

**Red Flags for Misclassified Phase:**
- [x] Claims Phase 1b but evidence suggests Phase 1a
- [x] Revenue includes pilots/POCs/discounted deals (case studies but no paying customers)
- [ ] Customers are different segments with different use cases (unknown)

**Key Observation:** Peter pivoted 8 weeks ago and has "case studies" but no mention of ARR, revenue, or paying customers. The phrase "take up too slow" confirms zero or near-zero traction. This is definitively Phase 1a.

**Actual Phase Determination:** **Phase 1a (Pre-revenue, Zero Traction)**

## 2. Founder Engine Assessment

### Dimension Scores (1-5 scale)

| Dimension | Score | Evidence/Notes | Weight (Phase 1a) |
|-----------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **A. Selling Capability** | 3/5 | Unknown sales skills; invested in sales infrastructure (leader, platform, bundles) | 20% |
| **B. Founder-Led Sales Execution** | 2/5 | **RED FLAG:** Hired sales leader before proving founder-led sales; "take up too slow" suggests delegation too early | 15% |
| **C. Learning Velocity** | 4/5 | Pivoted 8 weeks ago; familiar with disruption theory; engaged with GTM feedback; iterating | 20% |
| **D. Problem Clarity** | 3.5/5 | Understands "archaic processes" and "trust of claims" barriers; disrupting own industry | 18% |
| **E. Coachability** | 4/5 | Engaged openly with sales tips; admitted challenges without posturing; asked good questions | 15% |
| **F. Positioning Instinct** | 3.5/5 | "Hyper niche" positioning; clear on "disrupting own industry"; wedge thinking | 12% |

**Weighted Founder Engine Score:** **3.18 / 5.0**

**Calculation (Phase 1a):**
```
= (A × 0.20) + (B × 0.15) + (C × 0.20) + (D × 0.18) + (E × 0.15) + (F × 0.12)
= (3.0 × 0.20) + (2.0 × 0.15) + (4.0 × 0.20) + (3.5 × 0.18) + (4.0 × 0.15) + (3.5 × 0.12)
= 0.60 + 0.30 + 0.80 + 0.63 + 0.60 + 0.42
= 3.35
```

**Adjusted Founder Engine Score:** **3.35 / 5.0** (Developing - advisory first)

| Score Range | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| 4.0+ | Exceptional - strong invest signal |
| 3.5-4.0 | Solid - investable |
| **3.0-3.5** | **Developing - advisory first** |
| 2.5-3.0 | Significant gaps - pass or coach-only |
| <2.5 | Not ready - pass |

**Red Flag Check:**
- [ ] High Selling (4-5) but Low Founder-Led Execution (1-2) = Has skills but not doing the work
- [x] **Founder-Led Execution Score of 2** - Hired sales leader prematurely before proving founder-led sales

### Key Observations

**Strengths:**
1. **Industry insider** - Peter is "disrupting his own industry" (construction) which de-risks market understanding
2. **Coachable + Learning** - Engaged openly, asked good questions, familiar with disruption theory
3. **Right thinking** - Understands crossing the chasm dynamics, acknowledges trust barriers

**Development Areas:**
1. **Premature sales delegation** - Hired sales leader before personally closing 5+ deals
2. **No proven founder-led sales motion** - "Take up too slow" after hiring sales team suggests founder isn't in the trenches

## 5. Phase 1a Modifiers

### A. Founder-Led Execution Modifier

| Founder-Led Execution Score | Modifier |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| 5 (Obsessively doing sales) | +15% |
| 4 (Actively doing sales) | +10% |
| 3 (Doing some sales) | 0% |
| **2 (Delegating most sales)** | **-15%** |
| 1 (Avoiding sales / hired prematurely) | -25% |

**Score:** 2 → **Modifier: -15%**

### B. Market/Cultural Fit Modifier — NOT APPLICABLE (Zero-Traction Deal)

> **v2.2 Clarification:** Section B applies ONLY to companies WITH some traction (paying customers OR revenue > $0).
> For zero-traction deals like Tandm (ARR=$0, Customers=0), use Section E3 (Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty) instead.
> **NEVER apply both Section B and Section E3 to the same deal.**

**Applied:** **N/A** — See Section E3 below for zero-traction market-fit assessment.

### C. Premature Scaling Penalty (max -50%)

- [x] **Hired sales before founder closed 5+ deals: -20%** (Hired sales leader pre-revenue)
- [ ] SDRs/BDRs before validated ICP: -15% (Unknown)
- [ ] Paid ads before positioning clear: -10% (Unknown)
- [ ] 5+ employees with <$50K ARR: -10% (Unknown)

**Applied:** **-20%**

### D. Grit/Tenacity Premium (max +25%)

- [ ] Manual high-touch sales (door-to-door, cold calling): +10% (No evidence)
- [ ] Evidence of facing rejection, iterating: +5% (Some iteration, but delegated)
- [ ] Extreme capital efficiency: +10% (Unknown)
- [ ] Bootstrapped to $50K+ ARR: +10% (No revenue)

**Applied:** **+0%**

**Total Phase 1a Modifier:** -15% (Founder-Led Execution) + N/A (Section B skipped - use E3) - 20% (Premature Scaling) + 0% (Grit) = **-35%**

*Note: Market/Cultural Fit is assessed in Section E3 for zero-traction deals, not Section B.*

---

## 5a. Reality Check - MANDATORY (v2.2)

*Apply AFTER Phase 1a Modifiers. Zero-traction deals MUST pass through this gate.*

### Traction Status Assessment

| Question | Answer | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| ARR = $0? | **YES** | Zero-traction discount required |
| Paying Customers = 0? | **YES** | Zero-traction discount required |
| Working product in market? | **YES** | MVP exists |
| Users (even non-paying)? | **Unknown** | Likely some (case studies) |
| Founder from industry selling to? | **YES** | Reduces discount by 10% |

### E1. Zero-Traction Discount

*(Apply if ARR = $0 AND Paying Customers = 0)*

| Condition | Discount | Applies? |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **No revenue + no customers (with MVP)** | **-50% to -60%** | [x] **-50%** (has MVP) |
| No revenue + no customers + no product | -60% to -70% | [ ] |
| Pilot/POC only (no paying customers) | -30% to -40% | [ ] |
| Has some paying customers | 0% | [ ] |

**Zero-Traction Discount Applied:** **-50%**

### E2. Idea-Stage Valuation Cap

| Stage Evidence | Cap | Applies? |
|----------------|-----|----------|
| Idea only (no product) | $300K - $500K | [ ] |
| MVP but no users | $400K - $600K | [ ] |
| **MVP with users, no revenue** | **$500K - $800K** | [x] Has MVP, likely has some users (case studies) |
| First paying customer(s) | $800K - $1.5M | [ ] |
| Revenue + customers | No cap | [ ] |

**Cap Applied:** **$800K maximum**

### E3. Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty (ZERO-TRACTION DEALS ONLY)

> **v2.2 Clarification:** This section applies ONLY to zero-traction deals (ARR=$0 AND Customers=0).
> For companies with traction, use Section B (Market/Cultural Fit Modifier) instead.
> **Tandm Status:** Zero-traction (ARR=$0, Customers=0) → Section E3 applies.

#### Sales Complexity Assessment

**Tandm's Sale Type:** PropTech selling to construction industry (architects and builders)

| Sale Type | Classification | Penalty Range (if NOT from industry) |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| **High-touch enterprise** (mining, construction, healthcare, govt) | **YES - Tandm** | -20% to -25% |
| SMB direct sales (tradies, restaurants, small hospitality) | No | -15% to -20% |
| Horizontal SaaS to tech-native buyers (dev tools, marketing tech) | No | -10% to -15% |

**Assessment:** Tandm is selling to architects and builders in the construction industry. This is **high-touch enterprise** territory with:
- Long sales cycles (construction projects are multi-month/year)
- Multiple stakeholders (architects, builders, clients)
- Deep domain expertise required (building codes, project management, industry norms)
- Trust is critical (Peter called out "trust of claims" as a key barrier)

#### Market-Fit Penalty Application

| Condition | Penalty | Applies? |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Founder NOT from country AND NOT from industry (+ high-touch) | -25% to -30% | [ ] |
| Founder NOT from industry (+ high-touch enterprise) | -20% to -25% | [ ] |
| Founder from industry but NOT from country | -10% | [ ] |
| **Founder from country AND from industry** | **0%** | [x] Peter IS from construction |

**Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty Applied:** **0%** (Industry insider advantage)

**Why 0%:** Peter is "disrupting his own industry" - he comes FROM construction. This completely offsets what would otherwise be a -20% to -25% penalty for selling high-touch enterprise to construction without industry background. This is a significant competitive advantage.

### E4. Override Conditions

*(Reduce discount if applicable - max 50% reduction of original discount)*

| Condition | Reduction | Applies? |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Serial entrepreneur with successful exit | +20% | [ ] Unknown |
| **Deep domain expert (10+ years in industry)** | **+15%** | [x] Peter is from construction |
| Proprietary technology with IP protection | +10% | [ ] Unknown |
| Strong existing investor commitments | +10% | [ ] Unknown |

**Override Reduction Applied:** **15%** (of original discount)

**Adjusted Zero-Traction Discount:**
- Original: -50%
- Industry expert reduction: 15% of 50% = 7.5%
- Final Zero-Traction Discount: **-50% + 7.5% = -42.5%**

### Reality Check Summary

| Line Item | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Pre-Reality Check Range** | $1.19M - $1.63M |
| Zero-Traction Discount | -50% (before override) |
| Override Reduction | 15% (domain expertise) |
| Adjusted Zero-Traction Discount | **-42.5%** |
| Idea-Stage Cap | **$800K** |
| Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty | 0% (industry insider) |
| **Post-Reality Check Range** | **$575K - $800K** (capped) |

**Reality Check Notes:**
- Tandm has ZERO paying customers and ZERO ARR
- Has working MVP (reduces severity of discount)
- Peter is from the construction industry (reduces discount by 15%)
- Even with favorable adjustments, valuation is hard-capped at $500K-$800K for "MVP with users, no revenue"
- The industry insider advantage is significant but cannot overcome zero traction

---

### F. Ownership Sanity Check — NEW (v2.2)

*This is a "bounding box" check — not a valuation method, but a reality test comparing framework output against market expectations based on round size and dilution.*

**Formula:** `Implied Pre-Money = (Round Size ÷ Target Dilution) - Round Size`

#### AU/NZ Pre-seed Market Norms (2024-25)

| Round Type | Typical Raise | Typical Dilution | Implied Pre-Money Range |
|------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Pre-seed (angel-only) | $250K-$750K | 5%-12% | $1.8M - $14.75M |
| Pre-seed (with lead) | $750K-$2M | 10%-20% | $3.0M - $18M |
| Seed | $2M-$6M | 15%-25% | $6M - $34M |

#### Tandm Ownership Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Founder's Stated Raise** | Unknown (not disclosed) |
| **Expected Dilution Range** | Unknown |
| **Implied Pre-Money (low)** | Cannot calculate |
| **Implied Pre-Money (mid)** | Cannot calculate |
| **Implied Pre-Money (high)** | Cannot calculate |
| **Framework Valuation Range** | $575K - $800K |
| **Alignment Status** | **Cannot Assess** - Raise amount unknown |

#### Scenario Analysis (If Raise Were Known)

*For illustration, here's what different raise amounts would imply:*

| If Raise = | At 10% Dilution | At 15% Dilution | At 20% Dilution | Framework Range | Gap? |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|------|
| $250K | $2.25M | $1.42M | $1.0M | $575K-$800K | **Gap** (founder high) |
| $500K | $4.5M | $2.83M | $2.0M | $575K-$800K | **Major Gap** |
| $750K | $6.75M | $4.25M | $3.0M | $575K-$800K | **Major Gap** |

**Interpretation:**

Even at a modest $250K raise with 20% dilution (generous terms for founder), the market would expect a $1.0M pre-money valuation — which is 25%+ above Tandm's reality-checked range of $575K-$800K.

**This means:**
1. If Peter raises ANY meaningful amount ($250K+), there will likely be a gap between market expectations and reality-checked valuation
2. To achieve $575K-$800K pre-money with market-standard dilution (15%), Tandm should raise only $100K-$150K
3. Alternative: Raise more at higher dilution (e.g., $400K at 40% dilution = $600K pre-money)

**Recommendation:** Before discussing raise, calibrate Peter on zero-traction valuation reality. Many founders at this stage expect Phase 1b valuations ($2.5M-$5M) when reality supports $575K-$800K.

**Notes:**
- This sanity check will be completed once raise expectations are known
- If Peter expects a $500K+ raise at <20% dilution, there is a fundamental misalignment that needs addressing before any investor introduction

## 8. Decision Matrix

### Advisory Decision

| Criteria | Threshold | Status | Notes |
|----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Founder Engine Score | >=3.0 | **Met** | Score: 3.35 |
| Coachability | >=4 | **Met** | Score: 4 |
| Meaningful equity/fee | Available | Unknown | Need to confirm |

**Advisory Decision:** **Yes (conditional)** - FE Score 3.35 and Coachability 4 both meet thresholds. Strong advisory candidate to help fix premature delegation issue.

### Investment Decision

| Criteria | Threshold | Status | Notes |
|----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Founder Engine Score | >=3.5 | **Not Met** | Score: 3.35 (close) |
| Valuation | <=$3M pre | **Met** | Range: $575K-$800K |
| Path to $50M+ exit | Clear | **Not Met** | Hyper-niche limits scale |
| Can add real value | Yes | **Met** | Deep construction/GTM expertise |

**Investment Decision:** **No (Not Yet)** - Score slightly below threshold; zero traction; path to scale unclear

### VC Introduction Decision

| Criteria | Threshold | Status | Notes |
|----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Phase | 1b+ | **Not Met** | Actual: Phase 1a |
| Founder Engine Score | >=3.5 | **Not Met** | Score: 3.35 |
| GTM Readiness | >=40 | **Not Met** | Score: 32.5 |
| Valuation aligned | <=1.5x gap | Unknown | No expectations shared |
| Can articulate in 2 mins | Yes | Unknown | Not assessed |

**VC Intro Decision:** **Not Yet** - 1 of 5 criteria met (at best). Too early; needs 6+ months of traction.

## 9. Key Risks

1. **Zero Traction Risk:** 8 weeks post-pivot with no paying customers. The "product fits" claim is unvalidated.

2. **Premature Delegation Risk:** Hired sales leader before proving founder-led sales. This delays learning loops and burns cash.

3. **Hyper-Niche TAM Risk:** Architect-builder matching in Australia may have limited total addressable market. Path to $50M+ exit unclear.

4. **Trust Barrier Risk:** Early-stage PropTech selling to conservative construction industry. "Trust of claims" problem acknowledged but unsolved.

5. **Advisor Saturation Risk:** Already has "disruption theory experts" and LinkedIn strategist. May be receiving conflicting advice.

## 10. Pattern Recognition

**Identified Patterns:**
- [ ] Pattern 1: Great Product, Weak GTM
- [ ] Pattern 2: Random Wins, No Pattern
- [ ] Pattern 3: Founder Can't Sell
- [ ] Pattern 4: Valuation Expectations Misaligned (unknown)
- [x] **Pattern 5: Too Early for VCs** - Zero traction, no repeatability
- [x] **Pattern 6: Premature Scaling** - Hired sales leader at $0 ARR

**Pattern Notes:**

**Pattern 5 - Too Early for VCs:**
- $0 ARR estimated
- 0 paying customers
- Still validating pivot (8 weeks)
- No repeatable anything

**Pattern 6 - Premature Scaling:**
- Hired sales leader before founder closed deals personally
- LinkedIn strategist on board
- Sales platform set up
- "Take up too slow" after delegation

**Sachee-ism Applied:** *"Do things that don't scale"* - Peter should take back personal ownership of sales for 90 days before any further investment in sales infrastructure.

---

## 11. Next Steps

- [ ] Pass (with feedback)
- [x] **Tier 2 diagnostic (schedule calls)** - If Peter is interested in advisory
- [ ] Advisory proposal
- [ ] Investment discussion
- [ ] VC intro memo
- [x] **Check back in 6 months** - If not proceeding with advisory

**Specific Actions:**

1. **Have calibration conversation** about premature sales delegation. Share Pattern 6 observations.

2. **If advisory engagement proceeds:**
   - 90-day founder-led sales sprint
   - Peter takes back personal ownership of all sales calls
   - Document first 5 paying customers personally
   - Then revisit sales leader role

3. **Check back milestones:**
   - First paying customer closes
   - $25K ARR
   - Pattern emerges in customer profile

---

## Notes & Observations

**Positive Signals:**
- Peter is thinking about the right things (crossing the chasm, disruption theory)
- Open about challenges, not posturing
- Industry insider with credibility in construction
- Coachable - engaged with sales tips in conversation

**Concerns:**
- Classic premature delegation pattern
- "Take up too slow" after hiring sales team suggests the problem isn't resources, it's founder-led validation
- May have too many advisors already (disruption theory experts, LinkedIn strategist)

**Recommended Conversation Topics:**
1. "How many sales conversations have YOU personally had in the last 30 days?"
2. "Who made the last 5 sales calls?"
3. "Why did you hire a sales leader before proving you could close deals yourself?"
4. "What would it take for you to personally own sales for the next 90 days?"

## v2.2 Framework Updates Applied

This analysis has been updated to reflect v2.2 framework changes:

1. **Section B vs E3 Clarification**: Section B (Market/Cultural Fit) marked as N/A - Tandm is a zero-traction company, so Section E3 (Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty) applies instead. Both sections were never applied simultaneously.

2. **Variable Penalty by Sales Complexity**: Documented Tandm as "High-touch enterprise" sale type (construction industry). Would carry -20% to -25% penalty if founder weren't from industry. Peter's industry insider status reduces this to 0%.

3. **Section F: Ownership Sanity Check**: NEW section added. Framework valuation range ($575K-$800K) compared against implied pre-money from market-standard raise/dilution scenarios. Analysis shows potential gap if Peter expects typical raise amounts ($250K+) at standard dilution.

4. **AI Premium Assessment**: Updated to v2.2 criteria-gated approach (+$200K-$400K, requires 2/3 criteria). Assessed Tandm as 0/3 criteria - no AI premium applies.

5. **Framework Version**: Updated all references from v2.1 to v2.2.

**Valuation Range Unchanged:** $575K - $800K pre-money (no calculation changes, methodology refinements only)
