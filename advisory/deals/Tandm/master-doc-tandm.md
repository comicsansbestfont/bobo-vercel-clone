## 2. Deep Research

### 2.1 Company Background
> Architect-builder matching tool. Described as "hyper niche" by Sachee in outreach. Peter has been in the industry - disrupting his own industry (per his words).

### 2.2 Market & Industry
> Construction tech / PropTech. Architect-builder matching. Similar to mining tech in terms of "hyper niche" B2B.

### 2.3 Product/Service
> Platform matching architects with builders. Recently pivoted (~8 weeks ago as of 2025-12-01).

### 2.4 Business Model
> SaaS - specifics TBD

### 2.5 Growth Signals
> - Recently pivoted (8 weeks ago)
> - Hired sales leader
> - Got case studies developed
> - Set sales platform
> - Specific clear offerings/bundles
> - LinkedIn strategist on board

### 2.6 Key Stakeholders
> Peter Glodic - Founder

### 2.7 Competitive Landscape
> TBD - need to research architect-builder matching space

### 2.8 TLDR
> - Architect-builder matching platform (hyper niche construction tech)
> - Founder is disrupting his own industry
> - 8 weeks post-pivot
> - Has hired sales leader, developed case studies, bundles
> - Challenges: archaic processes, trust of claims, slow take-up
> - Familiar with Crossing the Chasm / disruption theory

## 3. GTM Assessment

### Current State
> Post-pivot (8 weeks). Has:
> - Sales leader in place
> - Case studies developed
> - Sales platform set up
> - Specific offerings/bundles
> - LinkedIn strategist on board

### What's Working
> - Product fits (per Peter: "happy that the product fits")
> - Has engaged advisors/strategists on LinkedIn

### What's Broken / Pain Points
> - "Take up too slow" - adoption velocity
> - Archaic processes in industry - resistance to change
> - Trust of claims problem (early stage, limited logos)

### Immediate Goals (Next 90 days)
> Accelerate adoption post-pivot

### Strategic Goals (12 months)
> Cross the chasm - move from early adopters to early majority

## 6. My Notes & Observations

### Hypotheses to Test
> - Is the pivot working? What metrics are they seeing?
> - Is the sales leader getting at-bats with right buyers?
> - Is Peter still in the room for sales calls?

### Red Flags
> - Early post-pivot (8 weeks) - still validating new direction
> - Already has advisors ("disruption theory experts") - may be saturated

### Opportunities
> - Strong conversation about crossing the chasm - he's thinking about the right things
> - Receptive to sales advice (engaged with my 3 tips)
> - Similar patterns to mining tech - could share relevant frameworks

### Pattern Recognition
> Classic "Yeah Nah" pattern - hyper niche vertical SaaS struggling with:
> - Trust of claims (no logos yet)
> - Archaic processes (conservative buyers)
> - Founder stepping back too early from sales

### Personal Notes
> - Smart founder - asking good questions
> - Open about challenges - not posturing
> - Has invested in GTM (sales leader, case studies, LinkedIn)
> - Knows disruption theory - wants execution help
