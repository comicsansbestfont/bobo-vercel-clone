**Sachee Perera** (9:45 AM)

Hi Peter, I'm doing some advisory for a small architect-builder matching tool and came across Tandm.

Looks hyper niche and wondering to see what you're seeing in the market?

Coming from a similar hyper niche background in mining would love to compare notes. curious to see any patterns.

Many thanks,
Sachee

well I have seen a lot and I continue to see a lot! a few aspects - the need to pivot (because I couldn't do it all myself), the archaic processes/people not wanting to change and trust of claims

---

**Sachee Perera** (10:55 AM)

the struggle is real - the processes bit is the most deflating with the big corps.

the "trust of claims" problem is brutal when you're early and don't have 10 logos to wave around.

how are you getting around that right now? case studies? pilots? Or just grinding through the skepticism?

---

**Peter Glodic** (10:58 AM)

I have employed a sales leader, who has now got case studies, he has now set the sales platform and we have specific clear offerings/bundles and we have got a linked in and strategist on board - that's how.

Probably all the things you would do, maybe others...?

What are your top 3 tips to get people to "jump the chasm" in SaaS technical sales?

---

**Sachee Perera** (11:07 AM)

sounds like you're heading in the right direction.

To answer your question on the chasm it depends...
...on how many logos you have under your belt. have you truly confirmed problem solution fit and at scale?

but funny you ask

because i just ran through this with someone else

on crossing the chasm

**Sachee Perera** (11:10 AM)

but from a sales perspective:

the biggest learnings is just the basics:
- Sell the cost of inaction, not the product. They don't trust your ROI claims, but they definitely feel their current pain. Lead with that.

- Find the person with something to prove. Not just someone who likes your tech - someone whose promotion depends on bringing innovation in. They'll sell internally for you. (help them sell - i typically create business cases and coach them through it)

- Create a forcing function. Conservative buyers will pilot forever. You need a reason they have to decide - price lock, limited rollout slots, regulatory deadline, something.

This is all assuming you're selling to enterprise or larger end of mid market.. however the motion needs adapting for smaller end of town

**Peter Glodic** (11:10 AM)

We are happy that the product fits etc - I am disrupting my own industry. But the take up....too slow!!! That's why we pivoted 8 weeks ago.
We have had disruption theory experts involved at my fingertips for years now also. Thats how I know about the chasm

---

**Sachee Perera** (11:18 AM)

Theory is solid - but the gap is always in execution.
8 weeks post-pivot is early. The real question is whether your sales leader is getting at-bats with the right buyers, and what's happening in those conversations.

---

**Sachee Perera** (11:18 AM)

Hopefully you're still in the room driving those?

the chasm doesn't get crossed by salespeople. It gets crossed by founders who can flex the product and close feedback loops in real time.

The sales leader scales what works. But the founder finds what works.

---

**Peter Glodic** (11:20 AM)

Agreed

---

**Sachee Perera** (11:22 AM)

Happy to share what I've seen work at this stage - and curious how the pivot's landing with buyers :)
