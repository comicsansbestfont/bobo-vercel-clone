## 2. Deep Research

### 2.1 Company Background
> Oli is an AI chatbot/tutor product. Nathan Barkell is the founder with a background in education (former teacher). Met via Sev who is acting as fractional CMO. Sev is a prior connection of Sachee's.

### 2.2 Market & Industry
> EdTech / AI Tutoring. Competing in the AI-powered education space.

### 2.3 Product/Service
> AI chatbot tutor called "Oli". Key differentiator vs ChatGPT (as claimed by Nathan):
> - Stores memory and context of the user
> - Similar concept to Sachee's Bobo project
>
> Need to validate the technical differentiation and actual moat.

### 2.4 Business Model
> TBD - likely SaaS subscription for students/schools. Need to validate.

### 2.5 Growth Signals
> - Raising $350K
> - ~40% of raise allocated to marketing
> - No customers yet (pre-revenue)
> - Has Sev as fractional CMO

### 2.6 Key Stakeholders
> - **Nathan Barkell** - Founder (education/teacher background)
> - **Sev** - Fractional CMO (Sachee's prior connection)

### 2.7 Competitive Landscape
> - ChatGPT and other LLM-based tutoring tools
> - Dedicated EdTech tutoring platforms
> - Memory/context is claimed differentiator but needs validation

### 2.8 TLDR
> - AI tutor chatbot called "Oli" with memory/context features
> - Nathan is a former teacher (strong domain expertise)
> - Pre-revenue, no customers yet
> - Raising $350K (40% to marketing)
> - Sev is fractional CMO (known to Sachee)
> - Differentiation claim vs ChatGPT needs validation

## 3. GTM Assessment

### Current State
> Pre-revenue. Raising capital. Has marketing leadership (Sev as fractional CMO) but no customers yet.

### What's Working
> - Founder has domain expertise (former teacher)
> - Has marketing help lined up (Sev)
> - Clear product vision

### What's Broken / Pain Points
> - No customers yet
> - Differentiation vs ChatGPT may be thin (memory can be added to ChatGPT)
> - Heavy marketing allocation (40% of raise) suggests awareness of customer acquisition challenge

### Immediate Goals (Next 90 days)
> - Close $350K raise
> - Presumably first customers

### Strategic Goals (12 months)
> TBD

## 4. Meeting Notes

*Extracted from /Meetings folder. Add new meetings at top.*

### 2025-12-12 - Networking Chat (Post-Boat)
**Attendees:** Sachee, Nathan Barkell, Sev
**Duration:** ~15 min (informal)

**Key Discussion:**
- Met after getting off the boat, talking to Sev
- Sev is helping Nathan with marketing as fractional CMO
- Oli is an AI tutor chatbot
- When grilled on differentiation vs ChatGPT, Nathan said memory/context storage is the key difference
- Raising $350K with 40% going to marketing
- No customers yet

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Send Cal.com link to Nathan
- [ ] Research AI tutoring space before call
- [ ] Think through the memory/context differentiation angle

**My Observations:**
> Pre-revenue with no customers is concerning at the raise stage. Memory/context feature is similar to my Bobo project concept, but ChatGPT Plus already has memory features. Need to validate if there's a real moat here. Teacher background is good founder-market fit. Heavy marketing allocation (40%) could indicate they know customer acquisition will be hard.

| Date | Channel | Direction | Summary |
|------|---------|-----------|---------|
| 2025-12-12 | In-Person | Inbound | Met at networking event via Sev connection |

**Channel codes:** Email, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Call, SMS, Slack
**Direction:** Inbound, Outbound

---

## 6. My Notes & Observations

### Hypotheses to Test
> - Is memory/context a real differentiator or is ChatGPT Plus catching up?
> - Who is the ICP - students direct, parents, schools, tutoring centers?
> - What's the pricing model and unit economics assumption?
> - Why no customers yet if product exists?

### Red Flags
> - No customers yet while raising
> - Differentiation claim is weak (ChatGPT has memory now)
> - 40% to marketing may indicate product isn't pulling demand

### Opportunities
> - If they can find a specific niche (e.g., specific subject, K-12 vs university)
> - Teacher founder could unlock school distribution
> - Sev connection means warm relationship

### Pattern Recognition
> - Pre-revenue raise with heavy marketing allocation = red flag
> - AI wrapper risk (could be thin moat over LLM APIs)
> - Need to validate unique value proposition

### Personal Notes
> - Sev connection is good
> - Need to be careful about over-investing time if moat is thin
> - Could be advisory fit if they pivot to sharper positioning
