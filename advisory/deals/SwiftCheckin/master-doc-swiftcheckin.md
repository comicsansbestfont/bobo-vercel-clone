## 2. Deep Research

### 2.1 Company Background
SwiftCheckin is a construction technology startup founded by Boney Mylady. The company pivoted from a different sector (TAFE/education) to focus on construction operations software. The platform offers timesheet tracking, scheduling, project management, compliance, and budgeting features for construction contractors. Pre-revenue status with strong technical capability but struggling to find product-market fit.

### 2.2 Market & Industry
**Vertical:** Construction Technology (ConTech) - Workforce Management & Field Service Management

**Market Size:**
- TAM: $538.6 billion (Australian construction operations software)
- SAM: Trade Contractors (20-100 employees) + General Contractors/Fit-out Firms
- SOM: ~1,500 electrical contractors with 5-50 staff actively suffering overtime overruns (target for beachhead)

**Market Status:** "Red Ocean" - mature, saturated, highly competitive. NOT a greenfield opportunity.

### 2.3 Product/Service
**Core Product:** SwiftCheckin - Construction workforce management platform

**Features:**
- Mobile check-in/check-out (QR code, GPS, kiosk)
- Timesheet automation
- Scheduling & job allocation
- Project management
- Compliance management
- Budgeting & cost tracking
- Payroll integration (MYOB, Xero)

**Core Problem:** Platform is "all-in-one" trying to do everything, doing none exceptionally well. Solution in search of a well-defined problem.

### 2.4 Business Model
**Model:** B2B SaaS subscription
**Pricing:** Per-user per month (exact pricing undefined/inconsistent)
**Target ACV:** ~$2,000-10,000/year per customer (depending on size)

### 2.5 Growth Signals
- Strong technical team with fast build capacity
- First trial customers secured during engagement (Damian/Mr Shingles, MJ Constructions, Ariel)
- Website delivers professional first impression
- Passionate founder committed to the problem space

**Warning Signals:**
- Zero revenue at engagement start
- $20-25K monthly burn with no offsetting revenue
- Limited runway requiring quick traction or funding

### 2.6 Key Stakeholders
| Name | Role | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Boney Mylady | Founder/CEO | Primary contact, technical background, previously coding with dev team |
| Sandy | Sales Manager | Lead sales execution, demo calls |
| Jayadev | Marketing | Website, content, digital marketing |
| Nisha | Operations/Support | Customer onboarding, trials |
| Kavitha | SDR | Outbound calling, tech-touch sequences |

### 2.7 Competitive Landscape
**Entrenched "All-in-One" Platforms:**
| Competitor | Target | Perception |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Simpro/AroFlo | Trades & FSM SMEs | Deep feature set, end-to-end workflow. Very "sticky" |
| Procore | Mid-Large GCs | Enterprise-grade, industry standard |
| Fergus | Trades SMEs | "Built by tradies for tradies" - solid workflow |
| ServiceM8 | Small Trades (1-20) | Easy to use, mobile-first |

**Specialists ("Good Enough" Ecosystem):**
- Deputy: Workforce management & scheduling
- Xero: Accounting with basic timesheet functionality
- Hammertech: Site safety management
- SignOnSite: Simple mobile check-in for job sites

**Key Finding:** First objection on cold calls is "We already use [Competitor X]". High switching costs = require 10x value proposition to win.

### 2.8 TLDR
- Pre-revenue construction SaaS struggling with "all-in-one platform trap"
- Technologically capable team, passionate founder, but critical strategic misalignment
- Operating with Growth-phase mindset while firmly in Traction phase
- Two validated ICP profiles identified: "Overtime & Overrun" contractors (internal employees) and "Subcontractor Verification" contractors (external subbies)
- Must abandon "all-in-one" strategy and hyper-focus on one problem, one persona
- First paying customer (Mr Shingles) closed as direct result of repositioned value prop

### 2.9 Pre-Engagement Customer Meeting Evidence

*Three customer meeting transcripts reviewed as part of diagnostic (see Research/_raw/)*

**Current Group Electrical** - Trial agreed
- 24-25 staff electrical contractor, manual timesheets taking 3+ hrs/week
- Pain: Overtime tracking, MYOB integration
- Demo: Feature dump despite customer only wanting timesheets
- Quote: "This is more work for me... I just care when they get there and they leave"
- Outcome: Trial agreed (MYOB integration solved acute pain)

**Edward Constructions** - Dead
- Wrong stakeholder (Ksenia - no authority)
- Already using Procore (defects) and Hammertech (check-ins)
- No discovery, immediate demo
- Quote: "We already have systems that work fine"
- Outcome: Polite rejection, unlikely to progress

**Slyco Group** - Warm interest
- Retail fitout, subcontractor-heavy, needs invoice verification
- Already using Fergus for employees, can't add subbies (per-user pricing)
- Better discovery (asked about pain points)
- Outcome: Warm interest, trial likely, potential expansion when WHS ships

**Key Pattern:** Feature dump demos, no SPICED discovery, wrong stakeholders, vague pricing

---

## 3. GTM Assessment

### Current State (Pre-Engagement - July 2025)
- Zero revenue, pre-product-market fit
- "Spray and pray" outbound: 592 cold calls, 99 DM conversations, 0 meetings booked (0% conversion)
- Generic lists (Yellow Pages), feature-led pitch, no ICP targeting
- Reddit/Google ads generating low-intent traffic with <10% engagement
- SEO ranking for keywords but near-zero CTR
- Sales demos: "show up and throw up" feature dumps, no discovery, no ROI framing
- HubSpot CRM underutilized, no pipeline discipline

### What's Working
- Strong technical team can ship fast
- Website representation is professional and trustworthy
- Comparison content (e.g., "Swift Checkin vs Simpro") gets 3+ min engagement
- Once focused on specific pain (overtime control), prospects engage deeply
- Trial onboarding is quick (<1 min registration, <20 min full onboarding)
- First trial customers showing strong engagement (Damian: all site users checking in, Ariel: 40% onboarded within hour)

### What's Broken / Pain Points
**Strategy:**
- Pursuing too broad a market, reacting opportunistically to feature requests
- No clear "north star" problem to solve
- "All-in-one" positioning = liability in mature market

**Sales:**
- Feature-led pitch ("we do automated timesheets and scheduling") = commoditized
- SDR calls: automated recording message + overseas accent = trust barrier
- No discovery, no ROI discussion, no clear next steps
- No multi-touch follow-up cadence (80% called only once)
- Demos overwhelm with irrelevant features

**Marketing:**
- Reddit ads: demonstrably negative ROI, 0.2-1.1 sec engagement
- SEO: thousands of impressions, near-zero clicks
- Generic messaging, no ICP-specific content

### Immediate Goals (90-Day Sprint - Delivered)
1. Pick and hyper-focus on one high-pain problem for one specific customer segment
2. Prove willingness to pay by securing first 5+ paying customers
3. Problem-centric demos and focused outbound list
4. Build only after evidence of traction

### Strategic Goals (12 months)
- Secure 5-10 paying customers in target segment
- Prove product-market fit with repeatable sales motion
- Raise funding if needed for scale
- Potentially expand to second ICP after proving first

## 6. My Notes & Observations

### Hypotheses to Test
> ✅ Validated: "Overtime & Overrun" contractor profile has quantifiable pain ($75K+/year savings potential)
> ✅ Validated: Product works when shown to right customer with right framing (Damian, Ariel)
> ⏳ In Progress: Can they convert trials to paying customers?
> ⏳ In Progress: Will hyper-focus strategy yield 5+ paying customers?

### Red Flags
- Zero revenue at engagement start with $20-25K/month burn
- Board may have limited patience for continued losses
- Remote offshore team creates some friction with Australian market understanding
- Boney spreading too thin (coding + GTM + fundraising)
- Risk of pivoting back to "all-in-one" if hyper-focus doesn't show quick results

### Opportunities
- **Technical speed**: Can ship features fast when focused
- **First mover on "Overtime Alerting"**: Specific niche competitors don't fully address
- **Proven onboarding**: <1 min to value is strong
- **Pricing arbitrage**: Fergus per-user model vulnerable to disruption
- **Trade association entry**: NECA, MBA events as channel
- **Accountant/bookkeeper partnerships**: Natural referral channel

### Pattern Recognition
> Classic "premature scaling" pattern - invested in SDR, Sales Manager, paid ads before proving product-market fit. Needs to return to founder-led sales to discover what works.

> Similar to CorePlan early days - needed to pick a beachhead (drilling contractors) and prove it works before expanding. SwiftCheckin needs same discipline.

> "All-in-one platform trap" - trying to be everything to everyone, ended up being nothing special to anyone. Seen this pattern in multiple vertical SaaS plays.

### Personal Notes
> Strong founder relationship built through Melbourne trip and consistent engagement. Boney appreciates directness and strategic thinking. Good chemistry.

> Wind-down was handled well - mutual agreement that execution (not more strategy) is needed. Offered continued support as sounding board.

> Potential future case study for advisory portfolio once they achieve traction.

## 8. Key Diagnostic Findings Summary

### Executive Summary
Swift Check-in is a technologically capable company with a passionate team. However, it is currently a **solution in search of a well-defined, high-value problem**. The company's pre-revenue status is not a failure of individual effort or technical execution but a direct and predictable consequence of a critical strategic misalignment: prematurely investing in scaling a GTM engine before achieving product-market fit.

### Root Cause: "All-in-One Platform" Trap
- Product tries to do a bit of everything (time tracking, scheduling, project management, compliance, budgeting)
- Ends up doing none exceptionally well
- Reactive development: added features piecemeal based on assorted customer requests
- Result: demos touch high-level on many modules, leaving prospects unclear on core value

### Key Finding: Two Validated ICP Profiles

**Profile A: "Overtime & Overrun" Contractor** (RECOMMENDED FOCUS)
- Mid-sized electrical/plumbing contractors with 20-50 employees
- Primary pain: Uncontrolled labor cost overruns, fraudulent timesheets
- Value prop: "Swift Check-In helps contractors protect project profit by eliminating unplanned overtime and automating timesheets"
- ROI: 5% reduction in overtime on $1.5M payroll = ~$75K/year savings

**Profile B: "Subcontractor Verification" Contractor**
- Commercial fitout, shopfitting, subcontractor-heavy GCs
- Primary pain: Invoice verification for subcontractors
- Value prop: "Swift Check-In provides undeniable proof of work for every subcontractor, saving GCs 10-15% on payouts"

### Strategic Imperative: Pick → Prove → Build
1. **Pick**: Hyper-focus on one high-pain problem for one specific customer segment
2. **Prove**: Secure first 5+ paying customers through problem-centric demos
3. **Build**: Only after evidence of traction, invest in scaling team/product/GTM

### GTM Audit Key Findings
- **Outbound**: 0% meeting conversion from 99 DM conversations (broken process)
- **Demos**: Feature dumps, no discovery, no ROI framing, passive closes
- **Marketing**: Reddit ads with <10% engagement, SEO with near-zero CTR
- **RevOps**: HubSpot underutilized, no follow-up cadence, no pipeline discipline
