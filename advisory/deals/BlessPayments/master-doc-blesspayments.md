### 2.2 Market & Industry

---

## 3. GTM Assessment

### Current State
> Growing organically through referrals (in-app referral mechanism). Using external marketing agency. Product-led growth motion working well for retention.

### What's Working
> - Referral-driven growth (word of mouth in migrant communities)
> - Strong product stickiness (50% with 10+ transactions)
> - Clear ICP focus (migrant community, specific professions)

### What's Broken / Pain Points
> - User acquisition is the main struggle
> - Expanding to multiple markets simultaneously
> - Marketing agency relationship not scaling (looking to bring in-house)
> - Need to scale beyond organic/referral

### Immediate Goals (Next 90 days)
> - Multi-market expansion (user acquisition focus)
> - Hire marketing lead (internal)

### Strategic Goals (12 months)
> TBD

## 4. Meeting Notes

*Extracted from /Meetings folder. Add new meetings at top.*

### 2025-12-12 - Networking Chat (Event)
**Attendees:** Sachee, Affy Bhatti
**Duration:** ~15 min (informal)

**Key Discussion:**
- Met via Nate (while Sachee was coming back from bathroom)
- Affy showed dashboards and analytics openly - very transparent
- Discussed early-stage GTM requirements and alignment
- Affy said Sachee "looked familiar" a couple of times

**Key Metrics Shared:**
- ~50% of users have 10+ transactions
- ~13% have 1 transaction then churn
- Majority users in NSW
- Key user job titles: chemical engineers, pharmacists

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Send Cal.com link to schedule proper discovery call
- [ ] Research migrant payments space before call

**My Observations:**
> Very aligned on early-stage GTM thinking. Open and transparent with data (good sign). Genuine rapport established. Strong product metrics suggest product-market fit emerging - challenge is distribution/acquisition, not retention.

## 6. My Notes & Observations

### Hypotheses to Test
> - Is the referral mechanism scalable across new markets?
> - What's blocking paid acquisition (CAC concerns? channel fit?)
> - How does market expansion work for a migrant-focused app?

### Red Flags
> - None identified yet

### Opportunities
> - User acquisition strategy development
> - Multi-market expansion playbook
> - Marketing team structure and agency coordination
> - Referral program optimization

### Pattern Recognition
> - Classic product-led growth company hitting distribution ceiling
> - Strong retention = product works, just need to pour more in the top

### Personal Notes
> - Good rapport, Affy was very open with data
> - Aligned on early-stage GTM philosophy
> - Interesting niche (migrant payments) with clear wedge
