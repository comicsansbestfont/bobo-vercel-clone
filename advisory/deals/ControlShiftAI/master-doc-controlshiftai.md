## 2. Deep Research

**Research Completed:** 2025-11-27 (company/founder), 2025-12-01 (market viability)
**Sources:** Claude Deep Research (primary), ChatGPT Deep Research (primary), Gemini (deprioritized - factual errors identified), Market Analysis (2025-12-01)

### 2.8 TLDR
> 3-5 bullet summary of the above

- **Product:** No-code platform for AI-powered chatbots and voice agents targeting SMBs (missed calls → booked appointments)
- **Founder:** Krishna Kishore Durgasi - 15+ years DevOps/cloud infrastructure experience, strong technical background but limited GTM/sales experience. Coachable, actively seeking help.
- **Stage:** Pre-revenue, recently launched (late 2025). Website has placeholder text suggesting early stage. No visible customers or case studies.
- **Core Problem:** Trying to serve 5+ verticals (Real Estate, Healthcare, Trades, Education, Hospitality) - needs ICP focus. Positioning is generic ("AI for SMBs") in crowded market.
- **Market Reality (2025-12-01):** AI voice agent market has 8x funding growth ($2.1B in 2024), but Australian trades vertical is **already crowded** (Johnni.ai, Sophiie AI, Heya, Get Fully Booked all targeting same segment). Platform risk is critical—ElevenLabs and OpenAI now competing directly with their customers. 60-70% first-year failure rate for AI wrappers.
- **Founder-Market Fit Concern:** Krishna has no trades industry background—he's a DevOps/cloud infrastructure expert. Winning in this market requires deep vertical expertise and industry relationships, not just technical capability. This is now a **GTM game, not a technology game**.
- **Revised Fit Assessment:** ⚠️ **UNCERTAIN** - Coachable founder, but lacks founder-market fit for trades vertical. Awaiting positioning worksheet response before final call.

### 2.9 Market Viability Analysis (Added 2025-12-01)

**Full Analysis:** `Research/2025-12-01-ai-voice-agent-market-analysis.md`

**Key Findings:**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Market Size | $2.4B (2024) → $47.5B by 2034 (34.8% CAGR) |
| VC Investment | $2.1B in 2024 (8x vs 2023) |
| Australian Competitors | 12-15 companies, most targeting trades |
| Platform Risk | CRITICAL - ElevenLabs, OpenAI now competing with customers |
| AI Wrapper Failure Rate | 60-70% in first year |
| Opportunity Window | 12-18 months before platform providers close gap |

**Australian Competitive Landscape:**

| Competitor | Funding | Positioning |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Phonely** (YC S24) | US$2.7M | Breakout leader, moving to US/enterprise |
| **Curious Thing** | A$8.36M | Enterprise outbound (not competing for trades) |
| **Johnni.ai** | Bootstrapped | $99/month, ServiceM8/SimPRO integrations |
| **Sophiie AI** | Bootstrapped | 175+ customers, aggressive PR |
| **Get Fully Booked** | Bootstrapped | $500/month, premium trades-only |

**Required Success Factors (from analysis):**
1. Deep vertical integration beyond reception (own workflow, not just phone call)
2. Proprietary integration moats (ServiceM8, SimPRO partnerships)
3. Industry-native GTM (trade associations, contractor networks)
4. Multi-provider infrastructure abstraction (reduce platform dependency)
5. Speed to revenue (12-18 month window)

**Critical Question:** Does Krishna have the trades industry expertise and relationships to compete on GTM, not technology?

### 2.1 Company Background
> What do they do? How long have they been around? What's their origin story?

**ControlShift AI** is an Australian startup building a no-code platform for AI-powered virtual receptionists (chatbots and voice agents).

**Key Facts:**
- Founded by Krishna Kishore Durgasi
- Recently launched (late 2025 based on website freshness indicators)
- Pre-revenue stage
- Solo founder (no co-founders identified)
- Based in Australia (042 phone prefix)

**Origin Hypothesis:** Technical founder with DevOps background saw opportunity to apply AI to SMB customer service automation. Likely inspired by the "missed call = lost revenue" problem.

### 2.2 Market & Industry
> What vertical/industry? What's the market size? What trends are relevant?

**Target Market (Stated):** SMBs across multiple verticals:
- Real Estate
- Healthcare
- Trades/Home Services
- Education
- Hospitality

**Market Context:**
- AI voice agent/chatbot space is rapidly growing
- SMB adoption of AI tools accelerating post-ChatGPT
- Australian SMB market is substantial but fragmented
- Competition is increasing rapidly in this space

**Key Trend:** "Missed call recovery" - SMBs losing business because they can't answer every call. AI voice agents positioned as solution.

**Red Flag:** Targeting 5+ verticals at pre-revenue stage is too broad. Needs vertical focus.

### 2.3 Product/Service
> What's the core product? Who uses it? What problem does it solve?

**Core Product:** No-code platform to create AI-powered:
- Chatbots for websites
- Voice agents for phone calls
- Virtual receptionists

**Problem Solved:**
- SMBs miss calls → lose customers
- Can't afford 24/7 human reception
- Need to qualify leads and book appointments automatically

**Product Maturity Signals:**
- Website has placeholder text (early stage indicator)
- Limited feature detail on site
- No visible integrations listed
- No pricing transparency
- Early-stage polish

**Differentiation Claim:** "No-code" setup, built for Australian SMBs

### 2.4 Business Model
> How do they make money? Pricing model? ACV range?

**Pricing Model:** Not clearly stated on website

**Likely Model (based on competitors):**
- Monthly SaaS subscription
- Possible usage-based component (minutes/conversations)
- Tiered pricing by features/volume

**Competitor Pricing Reference:**
- Rosie: ~$49-199/month
- Emitrr: ~$149-399/month
- General market: $50-500/month for SMB tier

**ACV Hypothesis:** $600-3,000/year for SMB tier

### 2.5 Growth Signals
> Funding? Recent hires? Press? Product launches? Traction indicators?

**Growth Signals (Positive):**
- Active founder (responded to LinkedIn ads)
- Seeking GTM help (action-oriented)
- Has functioning website and product positioning

**Traction Indicators (Concerning):**
- No visible customers or logos
- No case studies or testimonials
- No press coverage found
- No G2/Capterra reviews
- LinkedIn following minimal
- Pre-revenue after apparent development period

**Funding Status:** Unknown - likely bootstrapped given signals

**Team Size:** Solo founder (no hiring activity detected)

### 2.6 Key Stakeholders
> Who's the founder? Other decision makers? Who will I work with?

**Founder:** Krishna Kishore Durgasi

**Professional Background:**
- 15+ years in DevOps, cloud infrastructure, IT operations
- Strong technical foundation (AWS, cloud architecture)
- Experience with enterprise IT environments
- Based in Australia

**Founder Profile Assessment:**
- **Technical Depth:** Strong (DevOps/cloud background)
- **GTM Experience:** Limited (no visible sales/marketing background)
- **Sales Experience:** Minimal (likely no founder-led sales experience)
- **Content/Thought Leadership:** Limited LinkedIn activity
- **Coachability:** High signals (actively seeking help, specific goals)

**Working Relationship:**
- Will be 1:1 with Krishna
- No other decision makers identified
- Direct access to founder (ideal for advisory)

### 2.7 Competitive Landscape
> Who are competitors? How do they differentiate? Category status?

**Direct Competitors:**

| Competitor | Positioning | Traction | Notes |
|------------|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Rosie** | AI receptionist for home services | $1M ARR in 8 months | Focused vertical strategy worked |
| **Emitrr** | AI communication platform | $4M raised | Multi-channel approach |
| **Johnni.ai** | AI receptionist (Australian) | Active in AU market | Local competitor |
| **Slang.ai** | Restaurant-focused AI phone | Vertical focus | Category leader in niche |
| **Numa** | AI for dealerships | Auto vertical | Enterprise-focused |
| **Tidio** | Chatbot + live chat | Established | Broader scope, less AI-native |

**Competitive Position:**
- ControlShift is a late entrant in growing market
- No clear differentiation vs. competitors
- Competitors with vertical focus are winning (Rosie, Slang)
- Generic "AI for SMBs" positioning is weak

**Positioning Opportunity:**
- **Recommendation:** Narrow to single vertical (Australian Trades)
- Rosie's success (home services, $1M in 8 months) is template
- Local Australian focus could be differentiator

## 3. GTM Assessment

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-27 (post-discovery call)

### Current State
> How are they selling today? What's the motion?

**Sales Motion:** Founder-led outbound (networking events)
- **2 pilot customers** (1 tradie, 1 immigration agent) - both from personal network
- Going to business meetups (Parramatta Chamber of Commerce)
- No scalable outbound process
- Just hired 3 GTM interns (yesterday) - no clear direction for them

**Marketing Activity:**
- Website exists but no inbound generated
- Just started posting content on social media
- Founder avoided social media for 10+ years (just created Instagram last month)
- No founder brand established

**Lead Generation:** Manual networking only
- "Customers are not finding me, I'm trying to find customers"
- All leads from in-person networking events
- No inbound mechanism working

**Team Reality (Validated):**
- 12-15 people total (12 dev + 3 new GTM interns)
- All freelancers and unpaid interns (minimizing burn)
- No experienced GTM person on team
- Got 90-day GTM plan from interns but founder "not sure if going in right direction"

### What's Working
>

**Positive signals (validated):**
- ✅ 2 pilot customers (proof of concept exists)
- ✅ Founder willing to do networking (going to events)
- ✅ High self-awareness of gaps
- ✅ Operating lean (freelancers, interns, win-win arrangements)
- ✅ Custom consulting angle (using technical skills as wedge)
- ✅ Meeting with angel investors (one interested, needs traction)

### What's Broken / Pain Points
>

**Root Cause GTM Challenges (Validated):**

| Challenge | Severity | Evidence (From Call) |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **ICP Not Defined** | HIGH | "Not enough data points yet" - targeting RE, education, trades, immigration |
| **Positioning Not Clear** | HIGH | Can't articulate "what problem, for whom, what value" simply |
| **No GTM Leadership** | HIGH | "I don't know whether I can manage these GTM guys" |
| **Managing Blind** | HIGH | Hiring GTM freshies without knowing what good looks like |
| **Team Too Large** | MEDIUM | 15 people at pre-revenue (burn risk even if lean) |
| **Founder Stretched** | MEDIUM | Building product + trying to learn GTM + managing team |
| **Financial Pressure** | MEDIUM | "Sleepless nights", no paycheck for 7 months |

**Diagnosis:** Technical founder who built first, team scaled before GTM figured out. Now trying to retrofit sales motion onto existing product and team. Classic trap: hired GTM interns to "do sales" without founder knowing what good GTM looks like.

### Immediate Goals (Next 90 days)
>

**Stated Goal:** Onboard first 20-30 customers in next 6 months

**Reality Check (Post-Call):**
- Currently has 2 pilots (not paying customers)
- Just hired GTM interns with no direction
- No clear ICP to target
- Timeline is ambitious without focus

**Recommended 90-Day Focus:**
1. **Positioning clarity first** - What problem? For whom? What value?
2. **Pick ONE vertical** (recommend: Australian Trades)
3. **Convert 2 pilots to paid** or get 3-5 more design partners
4. **Founder does the selling** (not interns) - learn what works
5. **Pause hiring** until motion is validated

### Strategic Goals (12 months)
>

**Revised Hypothesis (Post-Call):**
- Convert pilots + add 8-10 more paid customers
- $1K-3K MRR ($12K-36K ARR) more realistic first year
- Validated ICP in ONE vertical
- Founder-led sales playbook documented
- Decision point: raise seed or return to consulting income

**Path to Breakeven (Krishna's Goal):**
- Needs: Platform revenue covering cloud + team costs
- Krishna mentioned this as primary milestone before considering funding
- Realistic if focused; unrealistic if scattered across verticals

### 2025-11-27 - Discovery Call (First Meeting)

**Date:** 2025-11-27
**Duration:** ~45 minutes
**Participants:** Sachee, Krishna Kishore Durgasi
**Transcript:** `Meetings/_raw/2025-11-27-discovery-call-transcript.md`

#### Key Takeaways

**How Krishna Found Sachee:**
- Saw LinkedIn post that morning
- Liked the website, understood the value proposition
- Gets lots of inbound from sales/GTM consultants but never responded until now
- Was looking for a GTM co-founder, registered on YC co-founder matching

**Business Update (Validated):**
- **Team Size:** 12-15 people (12 dev + 3 GTM interns just onboarded)
- **Funding:** Bootstrapped, no external funding
- **Customers:** 2 pilot customers (1 tradie, 1 immigration agent - both from network)
- **Timeline:** 7 months since quitting full-time job (quit May 2025)
- **Burn:** Operating lean - freelancers, unpaid interns (win-win learning arrangements)
- **Personal:** Family with 2 kids, "living without paycheck for 7 months, not easy"

**Origin Story:**
- From India, migrated to Australia 2017/18
- Parents passed away during graduation - "always independent individual"
- Former Global Head of DevOps (AU, NZ, APAC, Middle East, North America)
- High-paying job but "living paycheck to paycheck" mindset from lower middle class background
- COVID made him realize job security is illusion
- Christmas 2024: Started exploring AI, building at night while employed
- Realized "can't catch two rabbits" - quit to go full-time on startup

**GTM Reality (From Call):**
- "Customers are not finding me, I'm trying to find customers" - no inbound
- Going to networking events (Parramatta Chamber of Commerce, business meetups)
- Targeted: Real estate, education, trades, immigration agents
- Admits: "Not enough data points yet" to pick one vertical
- Just hired 3 GTM interns (fresh graduates, one from Sri Lanka with 4-5 years experience)
- Got a 90-day GTM plan from interns but "not sure if going in right direction"

**Key Quote:** "I don't know whether I can manage these GTM guys because this is something I'd never done. I'm learning. I'm experimenting."

**Red Flags Observed:**
- 🟡 Team of 15 at pre-revenue is concerning (burn risk)
- 🟡 Hiring GTM interns without knowing what good looks like
- 🟡 Spreading across multiple verticals without data
- 🟡 Personal financial pressure ("sleepless nights")

**Green Flags Observed:**
- ✅ High coachability - "I need some kind of guidance, some advisory"
- ✅ Self-aware about gaps - "sales, go-to-market, branding, marketing... this is not my area"
- ✅ Action-oriented - quit job, building, networking, hiring
- ✅ Going to events (most tech founders won't)
- ✅ Honest about struggles, not pretending
- ✅ Strong technical depth (knows what good looks like on eng side)

**Advice Given on Call:**
1. **"You know what good looks like"** - Told servant/dishes story. If hiring GTM freshies without GTM co-founder, won't know if they're doing good work.
2. **Focus on one vertical** - "As soon as you can pattern match, isolate. Focus on one market vertical."
3. **Experimentation is OK early** - "Spray and pray is okay now but not sustainable"
4. **Founder brand strength** - "Lead with 'I'm an engineer, I'll listen and build for you' vs 'I'm the CEO'"
5. **Positioning first** - "Not full-scale LinkedIn strategy. Just: What problem? For whom? What value?"

**Krishna's Ask:**
- "I need some kind of guidance, some advisory... that is the area I'm struggling"
- "I need some direction, some initial push"
- Wants to understand how Sachee works with pre-revenue startups
- Asked for follow-up email with write-ups

**Engagement Model Discussed:**
- Pre-revenue/early stage: No fees, equity path
- Over $200K ARR: Commercial pricing
- Can't work with everyone due to focus constraints

## DISCOVERY CALL STRATEGY

**Prepared:** 2025-11-27 (based on deep research synthesis)

### Call Objectives
1. Validate research hypotheses (ICP confusion, positioning gap, sales experience)
2. Understand Krishna's capacity and coachability
3. Diagnose root cause of GTM block
4. Deliver 1-2 "hot tips" as proof of value
5. Position GTM advisory if good fit

### Opening Approach (First 5 mins)

**Frame:** "I've done my homework on ControlShift AI and the AI voice agent space. I have some observations I'd like to share, but first I want to understand your perspective."

**Launch Questions:**
- "Tell me about the journey to ControlShift AI - what led you here?"
- "When you said your obstacle is GTM, what does that mean to you specifically?"

### Key Questions to Ask

**ICP Validation (Priority 1):**
- "Walk me through who your ideal customer is right now"
- "You list several verticals - Real Estate, Healthcare, Trades, Education. If you had to pick ONE to focus on first, which would it be and why?"
- "Have you had any conversations with potential customers yet? What did you learn?"

**Sales Motion (Priority 2):**
- "How are customers finding you today?"
- "Walk me through what happens when someone expresses interest"
- "Have you personally sold software before?"

**Product-Market Fit Signals (Priority 3):**
- "What's the reaction when you show people the product?"
- "Why do you think someone would pay for this vs. free alternatives or doing nothing?"

**Timeline Reality Check:**
- "You mentioned 20-30 customers in 6 months - walk me through how you see that happening"
- "What's your capacity to spend on sales right now? Hours per week?"

### "Homework" Observations to Share

**Show you've done research (impressive but not creepy):**

1. **Rosie Comparison:** "I noticed a competitor called Rosie hit $1M ARR in 8 months by focusing exclusively on home services. They didn't try to serve everyone - they owned one vertical. Have you thought about that approach?"

2. **Website Freshness:** "Your website positioning is clean but broad. I noticed you're targeting 5 different verticals - that's a lot for a pre-revenue company. What's driving that breadth?"

3. **Australian Trades Opportunity:** "The Australian trades market - plumbers, electricians, HVAC - is interesting. These businesses live and die by the phone, they're often one-person operations, and they're underserved by tech. Have you explored that specifically?"

### Hot Tips to Deliver (Value Demonstration)

**Hot Tip #1 - "Save the Cheerleader":**
> "Here's something that might help: At your stage, trying to serve everyone is the fastest way to serve no one. I call it 'Save the Cheerleader, Save the World' - if you can become THE solution for Australian tradies who miss calls, you'll own a beachhead that opens up the broader SMB market. Rosie did exactly this and hit $1M in 8 months."

**Hot Tip #2 - First 10 Customer Playbook:**
> "For your first 10 customers, forget about scalability. Your job is to find 10 trades businesses in Perth, offer them a free pilot in exchange for feedback, and learn everything about their workflow. Don't charge yet - trade free access for learning. Once you understand their world deeply, then you build the playbook."

**Hot Tip #3 - Founder LinkedIn as Lead Gen:**
> "You have 15 years of tech experience. That's credibility. Start posting on LinkedIn about the 'missed call problem' for trades businesses. Share the data, share stories. Your personal brand will generate more leads than your company page ever will. People buy from people, not logos."

### Red Flags to Watch For

| Red Flag | What to Look For | Deal Breaker? |
|----------|------------------|---------------|
| **Ego/Uncoachable** | Dismisses suggestions, knows better | Yes |
| **Unrealistic Expectations** | Expects 100 customers in 3 months | Discuss |
| **No Capacity** | Working full-time elsewhere, no hours for sales | Discuss |
| **Feature-First Mindset** | Only wants to talk about product, not customers | Discuss |
| **No Budget Signal** | Can't invest anything in GTM | Maybe |

### Questions Krishna Might Ask (Be Prepared)

1. **"How long until I get customers?"**
   - Answer: "Depends on your capacity. If you can dedicate 10-15 hours/week to sales, and we focus on one vertical, you could have 3-5 design partners in 60 days."

2. **"Should I raise money first?"**
   - Answer: "Not necessarily. Your first 10 customers prove more than a pitch deck. Investors want traction. Get 5 paying customers and you'll have options."

3. **"What do you charge?"**
   - Answer: "Let me understand your situation better first. My goal today is to give you value regardless. If there's a fit, we can talk about working together."

### Fit Assessment Framework

**Strong Fit If:**
- [ ] Founder is coachable (asks questions, takes notes)
- [ ] Willing to focus on one vertical
- [ ] Has capacity (10+ hours/week for sales)
- [ ] Understands value of founder-led sales
- [ ] Australian market focus
- [ ] Action-oriented (wants to move fast)

**Proceed with Caution If:**
- [ ] Wants to stay broad (5 verticals)
- [ ] Limited time capacity
- [ ] Expects quick results without effort
- [ ] Only wants tactics, not strategy

**Not a Fit If:**
- [ ] Uncoachable/ego-driven
- [ ] No capacity for sales
- [ ] Unrealistic expectations that can't be reset
- [ ] Looking for someone else to do sales for them

### Call Close / Next Steps

**If Good Fit:**
"Based on what I've heard, I think there's real opportunity here. Here's what I'd suggest as a next step: Let me put together a brief proposal for a focused ICP sprint - 2 weeks to nail down exactly who you're going after and build your founder-led sales playbook. Would that be helpful?"

**If Marginal Fit:**
"I want to be honest with you - I think [specific concern] might be a challenge. Before we talk about working together, I'd want to see [specific action]. Can you commit to that in the next 2 weeks and then we reconnect?"

**If Not a Fit:**
"I appreciate the conversation. I don't think I'm the right fit for what you need right now because [honest reason]. What I'd suggest instead is [alternative recommendation]."

## 6. My Notes & Observations

### Post-Call Assessment (2025-11-27)

**Overall Impression:** Strong coachability, genuine founder, real problem. Worth pursuing.

**Fit Assessment (Updated):**

| Criteria | Pre-Call | Post-Call | Notes |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Coachability | Unknown | ✅ HIGH | "I need guidance, some advisory... initial push" |
| Willing to focus | Unknown | 🟡 LIKELY | Understands the problem, hasn't committed yet |
| Has capacity | Unknown | ⚠️ STRETCHED | Managing 15 people + GTM + fundraising |
| Founder-led sales | Unknown | ✅ YES | Already going to networking events |
| Australian focus | ✅ | ✅ | Confirmed - Sydney/Parramatta based |
| Budget reality | Unknown | 🟡 TIGHT | Bootstrapped, 7 months no paycheck |

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Classic "build first, sell second" technical founder
- Scaled team before validating GTM (common mistake)
- Hiring to solve problem he doesn't understand (GTM interns)
- Strong personal story - will resonate in founder-led sales

**What I Liked:**
- Brutal honesty about struggles
- Already doing hard thing (networking events)
- Self-aware about gaps
- Asked for help (vs. pretending to know)
- Strong technical background = quality product likely

**What Concerns Me:**
- 15-person team at pre-revenue (even if lean, it's complexity)
- Hired GTM interns before knowing what to tell them
- Financial pressure may force bad short-term decisions
- May not have capacity to add advisory relationship

### Market Viability Assessment (2025-12-01)

**Overall Impression:** After deeper market research, significant concerns about viability. The AI voice agent market is more competitive than initially assessed, and the founder lacks the industry expertise needed to win.

**The Core Problem: No Founder-Market Fit**

Krishna is a talented DevOps/cloud infrastructure engineer with 15+ years of technical experience. But to win in the AI voice agent space for Australian trades, he needs:
- Deep understanding of trades workflows (emergency dispatch, quote follow-up, job scheduling)
- Relationships with trade associations, contractor networks, industry events
- Credibility with tradies ("I've been in your shoes" or "I've worked with 100 plumbers")

He has none of these. He's learning trades by going to Parramatta Chamber of Commerce meetings—that's admirable hustle, but it's not founder-market fit.

**Why This Matters:**

The market research shows this is now a **GTM game, not a technology game**:
- Platform providers (ElevenLabs, OpenAI) are eliminating the technical complexity that justified middleware
- 5+ Australian bootstrapped competitors already targeting trades (Johnni.ai, Sophiie AI, etc.)
- Differentiation requires deep vertical integration, not just AI capabilities
- a16z explicitly notes "domain expertise may matter more than pure technical sophistication"

**The Brutal Truth:**

A founder who has spent 20 years as a plumber and built an AI tool to solve their own missed-call problem would be a better bet than a DevOps engineer learning trades from scratch—even if the plumber's technical skills are weaker.

**What Would Change My Assessment:**

1. **Krishna's positioning response shows unexpected trades depth** - Maybe he has industry relationships or insights I don't know about
2. **He pivots to a vertical where he has founder-market fit** - e.g., DevOps/SRE tools, cloud infrastructure, IT operations
3. **He brings on a co-founder with trades industry expertise** - Trades operator + technical founder = viable team

**Current Recommendation:** Wait for positioning worksheet response before final call. If he picks trades without demonstrating deep industry knowledge, this is likely a pass.

### Hypotheses Status (Post-Call)

**Hypothesis 1: They have product but no GTM motion**
- ✅ CONFIRMED: "Customers are not finding me, I'm trying to find customers"

**Hypothesis 2: This is a classic Phase 1a scenario**
- ✅ CONFIRMED: 2 pilot customers, no paying customers, needs ICP, positioning, playbook

**Hypothesis 3: AI/SaaS product in competitive space**
- ✅ CONFIRMED: AI voice agents for SMBs, crowded market, no differentiation

**New Hypothesis: Positioning is the unlock**
- If Krishna can articulate "what problem, for whom, what value" clearly:
  - His networking becomes more effective
  - His GTM interns have direction
  - His investor conversations improve
  - His pilots can convert to paid

### Red Flags (Post-Call)
>

**Confirmed:**
- 🟡 Team size (15) at pre-revenue - burn risk
- 🟡 Hiring GTM people without knowing what good looks like
- 🟡 Financial pressure (7 months no paycheck, "sleepless nights")

**Not Confirmed (Green):**
- ✅ NOT ego-driven - very open to feedback
- ✅ NOT feature-obsessed - talked about customers, not features
- ✅ NOT expecting magic - realistic about difficulty

### Opportunities (Post-Call)
>

**Immediate opportunities:**
1. **Positioning worksheet** - Send simple framework to clarify value prop
2. **Vertical focus exercise** - Help him pick trades vs. RE vs. education
3. **Founder brand** - His "engineer who builds for you" angle is strong

**Engagement Options:**

| Option | Fit | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| Equity advisory | 🟡 Maybe | Need to assess capacity, current cap table |
| Paid diagnostic | ❌ No | He's bootstrapped, cash-tight |
| Light-touch mentoring | ✅ Yes | Low commitment, test coachability |
| Do nothing | ❌ No | He explicitly asked for help, good signals |

**Recommended Next Step:**
1. Send positioning worksheet (as promised)
2. See how he engages with it
3. If he does the work → schedule follow-up to discuss equity advisory
4. If he ghosts or doesn't do work → deprioritize
- Classic founder-led sales scenario (Sachee's sweet spot)
- Pre-revenue = clean slate for GTM strategy
- Specific goal suggests founder clarity
- Australian market (local advantage)

**Potential quick wins:**
- ICP definition workshop
- Positioning framework
- Founder-led sales playbook
- First 10 customers outbound strategy

### Pattern Recognition
>

**Similar to:** MyTab (pre-revenue, first customers goal)

**Differences from typical deals:**
- Very specific customer number target (20-30 vs. vague "growth")
- Named GTM as obstacle (unusual clarity for pre-revenue)

### Personal Notes
>

**Lead source validation:** This came through LinkedIn ads using organic content - validates the TOFU strategy. Track this as a data point for campaign effectiveness.

**Discovery call prep priority:** Need to deeply understand:
1. What the product actually does
2. Who they're targeting (ICP hypothesis)
3. Why they chose 20-30 customers as the target
4. Founder background and GTM experience level

| 2025-11-27 | Triage & Qualification | Cal.com form submitted - Goal: First 20-30 customers, Obstacle: GTM |

### Qualification Assessment

**Good Fit Indicators:**
- ✅ ARR Stage: Pre-revenue (Phase 1a sweet spot)
- ✅ Goal: GTM/customer acquisition focused
- ✅ Obstacle: GTM (direct alignment)
- ✅ Specificity: Clear customer number target
- ✅ Geography: Australia (local)

- ✅ Industry: AI/SaaS - voice agents for SMBs (confirmed via research)
- ✅ Founder background: 15+ years technical experience (researched)
- ✅ Coachability: HIGH (validated in discovery call)

**Concerns Identified (2025-12-01):**
- ❌ **Founder-Market Fit:** No trades industry background. DevOps/cloud expertise doesn't translate to trades vertical.
- ❌ **Market Crowding:** 5+ Australian bootstrapped competitors already targeting trades with similar positioning
- ❌ **Platform Risk:** AI voice agent space has critical platform risk (ElevenLabs, OpenAI competing with customers)
- ⚠️ **60-70% failure rate** for AI wrappers in first year

**What Would Change Assessment to GOOD FIT:**
- Krishna demonstrates unexpected trades industry depth in positioning response
- Krishna pivots to vertical with founder-market fit (DevOps, cloud, IT ops)
- Krishna brings on co-founder with trades expertise

**Updated Assessment:** ⚠️ **UNCERTAIN** - Awaiting positioning response. Leaning toward NOT A FIT due to lack of founder-market fit.
