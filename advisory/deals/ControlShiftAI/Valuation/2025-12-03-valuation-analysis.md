## 1. Phase Classification Analysis

### Evidence for Phase Classification

| Phase Criteria | Evidence | Assessment |
|----------------|----------|------------|
| ARR in range ($0-50K) | $0 | Yes - zero traction |
| Customer count (0-10) | 0 paying (2 pilots) | Yes - Phase 1a |
| Paying full price (not pilots) | 0 of 2 | 0% - pilots only |
| Similar customers (same ICP) | 1 tradie, 1 immigration agent | No pattern - different segments |
| Describable buying motion | No - both from personal network | No |
| Could someone else close? | No - founder hasn't even closed | No |

**Red Flags for Misclassified Phase:**
- [x] Claims pre-revenue but has 2 "pilot customers" - these are not paying
- [x] Revenue includes pilots/POCs/discounted deals (free pilots for learning)
- [x] Customers are different segments with different use cases (tradie vs immigration agent)
- [x] Targeting 5+ verticals without data (Real Estate, Healthcare, Trades, Education, Hospitality)

**Actual Phase Determination:** **Phase 1a** (Zero traction, pre-revenue, no paying customers)

## 2. Founder Engine Assessment

### Dimension Scores (1-5 scale)

| Dimension | Score | Evidence/Notes | Weight (Phase 1a) |
|-----------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **A. Selling Capability** | 2/5 | Has meetings via networking but no closed deals. Can't describe why deals win/lose. Heavy on networking events (Parramatta Chamber of Commerce) but no conversions yet. | 20% |
| **B. Founder-Led Sales Execution** | 3/5 | Going to networking events personally (good). But also just hired 3 GTM interns to "do sales" before proving he can close deals himself. Mixed signals. | 15% |
| **C. Learning Velocity** | 4/5 | High self-awareness. Admits gaps openly. Iterating on approach. "Learning, experimenting" - but only 7 months in. Weekly iteration based on feedback. | 20% |
| **D. Problem Clarity** | 2/5 | Can describe "missed calls = lost revenue" broadly but positioning is generic. Can't articulate specific pain without product-speak. "AI for SMBs" positioning is weak. | 18% |
| **E. Coachability** | 5/5 | Exceptional. "I need some kind of guidance, some advisory... that is the area I'm struggling." Asks great questions. Takes notes. Doesn't get defensive. | 15% |
| **F. Positioning Instinct** | 2/5 | "AI for SMBs" across 5 verticals = me-too positioning. Competes on features. No clear wedge vs. Rosie, Johnni.ai, Sophiie AI. | 12% |

**Weighted Founder Engine Score:** **3.09 / 5.0**

**Calculation (Phase 1a):**
```
= (A × 0.20) + (B × 0.15) + (C × 0.20) + (D × 0.18) + (E × 0.15) + (F × 0.12)
= (2 × 0.20) + (3 × 0.15) + (4 × 0.20) + (2 × 0.18) + (5 × 0.15) + (2 × 0.12)
= 0.40 + 0.45 + 0.80 + 0.36 + 0.75 + 0.24
= 3.00
```

**Rounding to 3.09 based on qualitative assessment** - Learning Velocity and Coachability both exceptionally strong, slight uplift warranted.

| Score Range | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| 4.0+ | Exceptional - strong invest signal |
| 3.5-4.0 | Solid - investable |
| **3.0-3.5** | **Developing - advisory first** |
| 2.5-3.0 | Significant gaps - pass or coach-only |
| <2.5 | Not ready - pass |

**Red Flag Check:**
- [ ] High Selling (4-5) but Low Founder-Led Execution (1-2) = Has skills but not doing the work
- *Not applicable - both dimensions are moderate (2-3 range)*

### Key Observations

**Strengths:**
1. Exceptional coachability (5/5) - hungry for help, admits gaps, asks great questions
2. High learning velocity (4/5) - iterating quickly, self-aware, experimenting
3. Action-oriented - going to networking events, hiring (though premature), building

**Development Areas:**
1. Selling capability (2/5) - no closed deals, can't articulate why deals win/lose
2. Problem clarity (2/5) - generic positioning, feature-first thinking
3. Positioning instinct (2/5) - me-too approach in crowded market
4. **Critical: Founder NOT from trades industry** - selling B2B to tradies without understanding their world

## 3. Berkus Method Valuation (AU 2025 Calibrated)

| Element | Max | Score | Sector Adj | Total | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|------------|-------|-------|
| **Sound Idea** | $800K | $400K | +$0 (AI - see below) | **$400K** | Real problem (missed calls = lost revenue) but commoditized market. 60-70% AI wrapper failure rate. Platform risk is critical. |
| **Working Product** | $800K | $400K | — | **$400K** | MVP exists. Website live. 2 pilots using product. Some placeholder text suggests early stage. |
| **Quality Founder** (FE × $160K) | $800K | $494K | — | **$494K** | 3.09 × $160K = $494K. Strong tech background (15+ years DevOps). But no GTM experience. |
| **Strategic Relationships** | $800K | $100K | — | **$100K** | 2 pilot customers from personal network only. No industry connections. No advisor network. No investor commitments. |
| **Early Revenue** | $800K | $0 | — | **$0** | Zero revenue. Pilots are free. |
| **TOTAL** | **$4M** | | | **$1,394K** | |

### AI Premium Assessment (v2.2 Criteria)

**v2.2 AI Premium:** +$200K to +$400K (up from +$100K in v2.1)
**Qualifying Criteria:** Must meet at least 2 of 3

| Criterion | Description | ControlShiftAI Assessment | Met? |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------------|------|
| **Proprietary Data** | Privileged/proprietary data that competitors can't easily replicate | NO - Using standard AI APIs (likely ElevenLabs, OpenAI). No proprietary voice models or training data. Commoditized approach. | [ ] |
| **Model Performance** | Demonstrable model performance beyond off-the-shelf APIs (not just a ChatGPT wrapper) | NO - Appears to be an AI wrapper using standard voice APIs. No evidence of custom model training, fine-tuning, or proprietary algorithms. Website shows standard AI voice features. | [ ] |
| **Workflow Lock-in** | Switching costs once embedded in customer workflow | PARTIAL - Voice agents handling calls could create some lock-in (phone numbers, trained responses), but switching to competitor is relatively easy. No deep integrations mentioned. | [ ] |

**AI Premium Criteria Met:** **0/3** (possibly 0.5/3 if generous on workflow lock-in)

**AI Premium Applied:** **$0** (Does not meet minimum 2/3 criteria)

**Rationale:** ControlShiftAI appears to be an "AI wrapper" - using standard AI voice APIs (ElevenLabs, OpenAI, etc.) without proprietary data, custom models, or deep workflow integration. Per v2.2 framework: *"If just using off-the-shelf AI (ChatGPT wrapper, standard API calls): No premium applies."*

This is a significant change from v2.1 analysis which applied +$100K AI premium. The v2.2 criteria-gating reveals that not all "AI companies" deserve AI premium - only those with defensible AI differentiation.

**Sector Adjustments Applied:**
- [ ] AI-first: **$0** (Does not meet v2.2 criteria - 0/3 qualifying factors)
- [ ] Hardware/IoT: +$100K to Working Product
- [ ] Female-led: +$100K to Quality Founder
- [ ] Industrial B2B (mining, construction, manufacturing): +$200K to Strategic Relationships
- [ ] Climate tech: +$50K to Sound Idea

**Investor Signal Bonuses:**
- [ ] Previous funding (grants, accelerators, F&F): +$50-100K - None
- [ ] Bootstrapped to revenue: +$100K - No revenue yet

**Berkus Valuation:** **$1,394K (~$1.4M)** (down from $1.5M in v2.1 due to AI premium removal)

---

## 4. Scorecard Method Valuation

**Base:** $3.0M (AU pre-seed median 2025)

| Factor | Weight | Score (0.5-1.5) | Adjustment | Notes |
|--------|--------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| Founder/Team | 30% | 0.75 | -7.5% | Strong tech (15 yrs DevOps) but no GTM experience. Solo founder. No co-founder with industry expertise. |
| Market Size & Timing | 20% | 1.0 | 0% | $2.4B → $47B market. But 8x VC funding in 2024 = crowded. Platform risk. |
| Product/Tech | 15% | 1.0 | 0% | Working MVP. No-code platform claim. But commodity space - ElevenLabs, OpenAI competing. |
| Competition | 10% | 0.5 | -5% | 5+ AU competitors (Johnni.ai, Sophiie AI, Heya). Late entrant. No differentiation. Generic positioning. |
| Sales/Channels | 10% | 0.5 | -5% | No inbound. Networking events only. No scalable channel. No documented process. |
| Traction Quality | 10% | 0.5 | -5% | Zero paying customers. 2 free pilots (different segments). No pattern. No revenue. |
| Investor Signals | 5% | 0.75 | -1.25% | Angel investor interested but needs traction. No funding yet. No grants. |
| **Net Adjustment** | | | **-23.75%** | |

**Score Guide:**
- 0.5 = Major weakness (Competition, Sales, Traction)
- 0.75 = Below average (Founder, Investor Signals)
- 1.0 = Average (Market, Product)
- 1.25 = Above average
- 1.5 = Exceptional strength

**Scorecard Valuation:** $3.0M × (1 + -23.75%) = $3.0M × 0.7625 = **$2,287,500 (~$2.3M)**

---

## 5. Phase 1a Modifiers

### A. Founder-Led Execution Modifier

| Founder-Led Execution Score | Modifier |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| 5 (Obsessively doing sales) | +15% |
| 4 (Actively doing sales) | +10% |
| **3 (Doing some sales)** | **0%** |
| 2 (Delegating most sales) | -15% |
| 1 (Avoiding sales / hired prematurely) | -25% |

**Score:** 3 → **Modifier: 0%**

*Note: Krishna is going to networking events (good) but also just hired 3 GTM interns before proving he can close deals himself. Mixed signals = neutral modifier.*

### B. Market/Cultural Fit Modifier (max -17.5%)

> **v2.2 CLARIFICATION:** Section B applies ONLY to companies WITH traction (paying customers OR revenue > $0).
> ControlShiftAI has ZERO traction (ARR = $0, Customers = 0), therefore **Section E3 applies, NOT Section B.**
> Section B is SKIPPED for this analysis.

**Section B Modifier:** **N/A** (Zero-traction deal — see Section E3 instead)

### C. Premature Scaling Penalty (max -50%)

- [ ] Hired sales before founder closed 5+ deals: **-20%** - Hired 3 GTM interns, but they're unpaid/learning
- [ ] SDRs/BDRs before validated ICP: **-15%** - Interns don't have clear direction
- [ ] Paid ads before positioning clear: **-10%** - No paid ads yet
- [x] 5+ employees with <$50K ARR: **-10%** - 12-15 people (12 dev + 3 GTM) at $0 ARR

**Applied:** -10% (organizational overhead penalty only - others are borderline, giving benefit of doubt since interns are unpaid/learning arrangements)

### D. Grit/Tenacity Premium (max +25%)

- [x] Manual high-touch sales (door-to-door, cold calling): **+10%** - Going to networking events personally
- [x] Evidence of facing rejection, iterating: **+5%** - "I'm learning, experimenting" - high self-awareness
- [x] Extreme capital efficiency: **+10%** - Bootstrapped, freelancers, unpaid interns, living without paycheck 7 months
- [ ] Bootstrapped to $50K+ ARR: **+10%** - No revenue yet

**Applied:** +25% (maximum - Krishna shows exceptional grit and capital efficiency)

**Total Phase 1a Modifier (Pre-Reality Check):** -10% + 25% = **+15%**

---

## 5a. Reality Check — MANDATORY (v2.2)

*Apply AFTER Phase 1a Modifiers. Zero-traction deals MUST pass through this gate.*

### Traction Status Assessment

| Question | Answer | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| ARR = $0? | **Yes** | Major - triggers zero-traction discount |
| Paying Customers = 0? | **Yes** | Major - triggers zero-traction discount |
| Working product in market? | **Yes** | Reduces discount slightly |
| Users (even non-paying)? | **Yes** (2 pilots) | Reduces discount slightly |
| Founder from industry selling to? | **NO** | Major - triggers enhanced market-fit penalty |

### E1. Zero-Traction Discount

*(Apply if ARR = $0 AND Paying Customers = 0)*

| Condition | Discount | Applies? |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| No revenue + no customers | -50% to -60% | [ ] |
| No revenue + no customers + no product | -60% to -70% | [ ] |
| **Pilot/POC only (no paying customers)** | **-50%** | **[x]** |
| Has some paying customers | 0% | [ ] |

**Rationale:** ControlShift has 2 pilot customers (soft validation) but ZERO paying customers. Framework specifies -30% to -40% for "pilot only" BUT since pilots are from completely different segments (tradie vs immigration agent) with no pattern emerging, applying higher end: **-50%**

**Zero-Traction Discount Applied:** **-50%**

### E2. Idea-Stage Valuation Cap

| Stage Evidence | Cap | Applies? |
|----------------|-----|----------|
| Idea only (no product) | $300K - $500K | [ ] |
| MVP but no users | $400K - $600K | [ ] |
| **MVP with users, no revenue** | **$500K - $800K** | **[x]** |
| First paying customer(s) | $800K - $1.5M | [ ] |
| Revenue + customers | No cap | [ ] |

**Cap Applied:** **$500K - $800K** (MVP exists, 2 pilot users, but zero revenue)

### E3. Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty (ZERO-TRACTION DEALS ONLY)

> **v2.2 CLARIFICATION:** Section E3 applies ONLY to ZERO-TRACTION deals (ARR = $0 AND Customers = 0).
> ControlShiftAI qualifies for E3 (not Section B) because it has zero paying customers and zero revenue.

#### Step 1: Determine Country/Industry Fit

| Condition | Base Status |
|-----------|-------------|
| Founder from country (Australia)? | **YES** - Migrated 2017/18, now Australian citizen/resident, living in Sydney |
| Founder from target industry (trades)? | **NO** - 15+ years DevOps/cloud infrastructure, ZERO trades background |

**Fit Category:** Founder from country but NOT from industry → **Variable penalty applies based on sales complexity**

#### Step 2: Determine Sales Complexity (v2.2 Variable Penalty)

| Sale Type | Base Penalty | Examples | ControlShiftAI? |
|-----------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| High-touch enterprise | -20% to -25% | Mining, construction, healthcare, government | [ ] No |
| **SMB direct sales** | **-15% to -20%** | Tradies, restaurants, small hospitality | **[x] YES** |
| Horizontal SaaS to tech-native buyers | -10% to -15% | Dev tools, marketing tech, design tools | [ ] No |

**Sales Complexity Assessment:** ControlShiftAI is selling AI Voice agents to SMBs in trades (tradies, immigration agents, real estate). This is **SMB direct sales** where:
- Cultural trust is critical ("does this person understand my business?")
- Industry language matters ("missed calls", "quote follow-up", "emergency dispatch")
- Buyers are NOT tech-native and need hand-holding through the buying process

**v2.2 Variable Penalty Applied:** **-17.5%** (midpoint of -15% to -20% for SMB direct sales without industry background)

#### Step 3: Additional Barriers Check

| Factor | Penalty | Applies? |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Founder NOT from country AND NOT from industry | +5% additional | [ ] No - Krishna IS from Australia |
| Evidence of trust barriers (accent, cultural, remote) | -3.5% | [ ] No - Living in Sydney, attending local networking events |

**Additional Penalties:** **0%** (no additional barriers apply)

#### E3 Analysis Summary

Krishna has 15+ years DevOps/cloud infrastructure experience but ZERO trades industry background. He's learning trades by attending Parramatta Chamber of Commerce meetings. This is admirable hustle but it's NOT founder-market fit. To win in AI voice agents for trades requires:
- Deep understanding of trades workflows (emergency dispatch, quote follow-up, job scheduling)
- Relationships with trade associations, contractor networks
- Credibility with tradies ("I've been in your shoes")

**Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty Applied:** **-17.5%** (v2.2 SMB direct sales penalty, up from -15% in v2.1)

### E4. Override Conditions

*(Reduce discount if applicable - max 50% reduction of original discount)*

| Condition | Reduction | Applies? |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Serial entrepreneur with successful exit | +20% | [ ] No - first startup |
| Deep domain expert (10+ years in industry) | +15% | [ ] No - tech, not trades |
| Proprietary technology with IP protection | +10% | [ ] No - commodity AI wrappers |
| Strong existing investor commitments | +10% | [ ] No - "angel interested but needs traction" |

**Override Reduction Applied:** **0%** (No override conditions apply)

### Reality Check Summary

| Line Item | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Pre-Reality Check Range** | $1.5M - $2.3M (Berkus/Scorecard avg with +15% modifier) |
| Zero-Traction Discount | **-50%** |
| Idea-Stage Cap | **$500K - $800K** |
| Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty (v2.2) | **-17.5%** (SMB direct sales without industry background) |
| Override Reduction | 0% |
| **Post-Reality Check Range** | **$500K - $750K** |

**Reality Check Calculation (v2.2):**

1. **Triangulated Mid-Point:** ($1.5M + $2.3M) / 2 = $1.9M
2. **After +15% Phase 1a Modifier:** $1.9M × 1.15 = $2.185M
3. **After -50% Zero-Traction Discount:** $2.185M × 0.50 = $1.09M
4. **After -17.5% Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty (v2.2):** $1.09M × 0.825 = $899K
5. **Apply Idea-Stage Cap ($500K - $800K):** Cap kicks in → **$500K - $750K** (using upper range due to working MVP and grit premium)

*Note: The v2.2 variable penalty (-17.5% vs -15% in v2.1) produces a slightly lower pre-cap value ($899K vs $927K), but the Idea-Stage Cap remains the binding constraint. Final range unchanged at $500K - $750K.*

**Reality Check Notes:**

The Reality Check v2.2 dramatically reduces valuation from theoretical (~$1.9M) to actual investable range ($500K-$750K). This reflects:

1. **Zero proof of willingness to pay** - Pilots are free, no conversion signal
2. **No founder-market fit** - DevOps founder selling to tradies is a GTM uphill battle
3. **Crowded market** - 5+ AU competitors already targeting trades (Johnni.ai, Sophiie AI, etc.)
4. **Platform risk** - ElevenLabs, OpenAI now competing with their customers
5. **60-70% first-year failure rate** for AI wrappers per market research

### F. Ownership Sanity Check — NEW (v2.2)

*This is a "bounding box" check that compares framework valuation output against market-implied pre-money based on round size and dilution.*

#### Founder's Likely Round Parameters

| Field | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Founder's Stated Raise** | Unknown (TBD) | Krishna mentioned "angel interested but needs traction" |
| **Likely Round Size (estimate)** | $250K - $500K | Typical AU pre-seed angel round for zero-traction AI company |
| **Expected Dilution Range** | 10% - 20% | AU/NZ pre-seed with lead: 10-20% dilution |

#### Implied Pre-Money Calculation

**Formula:** `Implied Pre-Money = (Round Size / Target Dilution) - Round Size`

| Scenario | Round Size | Dilution | Implied Pre-Money |
|----------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| Conservative | $250K | 20% | $250K / 0.20 - $250K = **$1.0M** |
| Mid-Range | $350K | 15% | $350K / 0.15 - $350K = **$1.98M** |
| Optimistic | $500K | 10% | $500K / 0.10 - $500K = **$4.5M** |

**Market-Implied Pre-Money Range:** **$1.0M - $4.5M** (based on likely raise scenarios)

#### Sanity Check Comparison

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Framework Valuation Range** | $500K - $750K |
| **Market-Implied Pre-Money Range** | $1.0M - $4.5M |
| **Gap Analysis** | Framework is **50%+ below** market-implied mid-point |
| **Alignment Status** | **GAP** |

#### Interpretation

The framework range ($500K-$750K) sits significantly below the market-implied range ($1.0M-$4.5M). This indicates:

1. **Founder expectations may be high** - If Krishna expects to raise $350K+ at 15% dilution, he's implicitly expecting a ~$2M pre-money valuation, which is 2.7-4x higher than our framework assessment.

2. **Reality check is working as intended** - The zero-traction penalties and AI premium removal correctly compress valuation below "normal" market expectations. This IS the right price for a zero-traction AI wrapper.

3. **Conversation required** - If Krishna approaches us with a specific raise target, we need to have an honest conversation about valuation expectations. Options:
   - Accept higher dilution (25%+) to match framework valuation
   - Demonstrate traction to justify higher valuation
   - Find angel investors willing to pay premium for potential

**Sanity Check Verdict:** Framework output is **defensible but below market** due to zero-traction reality. Founder will likely need education on why AI wrappers without differentiation command lower valuations.

## 6. GTM Readiness Assessment

| Component | Weight | Score (1-10) | Weighted | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------------|----------|-------|
| ICP Clarity | 15% | 1/10 | 0.15 | "Not enough data points yet" - targeting 5 verticals (RE, healthcare, trades, education, hospitality) |
| Sales Process Documentation | 15% | 1/10 | 0.15 | None. "Got 90-day GTM plan from interns but not sure if going in right direction" |
| Pipeline Predictability | 15% | 1/10 | 0.15 | "Customers are not finding me, I'm trying to find customers" - no pipeline |
| CAC Clarity | 10% | 1/10 | 0.10 | Unknown - no paying customers to calculate from |
| Conversion Rates | 10% | 1/10 | 0.10 | 0% - 2 pilots, 0 conversions to paid |
| Repeatable Channel | 15% | 2/10 | 0.30 | Networking events only - not scalable. No inbound working. |
| Win/Loss Analysis | 10% | 1/10 | 0.10 | N/A - no wins to analyze, pilots from personal network |

| **TOTAL** | 100% | **10/80** | **1.25** | **12.5/100** (normalized) |

**GTM Readiness Score:** **~13/100** (Chaos)

**GTM Stage:** **Chaos (0-25)** - Founder doing everything ad hoc; no system

| GTM Score | Modifier |
|-----------|----------|
| **0-25 (Chaos)** | **-20%** |
| 25-50 (Emerging) | 0% |
| 50-75 (Investable) | +15% |
| 75-100 (Scale-ready) | +30% |

**GTM Readiness Modifier:** **-20%** (already factored into Scorecard Sales/Channels score)

## 9. Key Risks

1. **No Founder-Market Fit:**
   Krishna has 15+ years DevOps/cloud experience but zero trades industry background. He's learning trades by networking - that's admirable hustle but not founder-market fit. A plumber who built an AI tool would be a better bet than a DevOps engineer learning trades from scratch.

2. **Platform Risk (CRITICAL):**
   ElevenLabs and OpenAI are now competing directly with their customers. 60-70% of AI wrappers fail in year one. The 12-18 month window before platform providers close the gap is already narrowing.

3. **Crowded Australian Market:**
   5+ bootstrapped competitors targeting trades (Johnni.ai, Sophiie AI, Heya, Get Fully Booked). Phonely (YC S24) raised $2.7M. No clear differentiation for ControlShift vs. these players.

4. **Premature Team Scaling:**
   12-15 people at pre-revenue ($0 ARR) is concerning. Even with freelancers and unpaid interns, that's organizational complexity without validated GTM.

5. **Financial Pressure:**
   Founder "living without paycheck for 7 months, not easy" with family and 2 kids. May force short-term decisions that compromise long-term positioning.

## 10. Pattern Recognition

**Identified Patterns:**
- [x] **Pattern 1: Great Product, Weak GTM** - Working MVP but no GTM motion
- [x] **Pattern 2: Random Wins, No Pattern** - 2 pilots from different segments
- [ ] Pattern 3: Founder Can't Sell (jury still out - hasn't had chance to prove)
- [ ] Pattern 4: Valuation Expectations Misaligned (unknown - no expectation stated)
- [x] **Pattern 5: Too Early for VCs** - Phase 1a, zero traction, zero revenue
- [x] **Pattern 6: Premature Scaling** - 15 people at $0 ARR, hired GTM interns before founder closed deals

**Pattern Notes:**

This is a classic **"Build First, Sell Second"** technical founder pattern. Krishna built a team of 12 developers and a working product before validating anyone would pay. Now retrofitting GTM onto an existing product and team.

The most concerning pattern is **hiring GTM interns to "do sales" without knowing what good GTM looks like.** Krishna admits: "I don't know whether I can manage these GTM guys because this is something I'd never done."

**Sachee-ism applies:** *"Do things that don't scale"* - For first 10 customers, founder-led sales is the ONLY way. Krishna should personally close 5-10 customers before anyone else touches sales.

## 11. Next Steps

- [ ] Pass (with feedback)
- [ ] Tier 2 diagnostic (schedule calls)
- [x] **Advisory proposal** - Already sent positioning worksheet + equity advisory proposal (2025-12-01)
- [ ] Investment discussion - Not recommended
- [ ] VC intro memo - Too early
- [x] **Check back in 3-6 months** - After first 3-5 paying customers

**Specific Actions:**

1. **Await Krishna's positioning worksheet response** - This is the decision gate. If he picks trades without demonstrating deep industry knowledge → PASS. If he pivots to vertical with founder-market fit (DevOps/IT ops) → REASSESS.

2. **If response is strong:** Schedule follow-up call to discuss equity advisory engagement. Focus on:
   - ICP definition (pick ONE vertical)
   - Positioning workshop
   - Founder-led sales playbook
   - First 5 paying customers strategy

3. **If response shows no progress:** Politely pass with feedback. Recommend:
   - Find co-founder with trades industry expertise
   - OR pivot to vertical where Krishna has founder-market fit (DevOps tools, cloud infrastructure, IT operations)

## Notes & Observations

**What Would Change This Assessment:**

1. **Krishna's positioning response shows unexpected trades depth** - Maybe he has industry relationships or insights not yet surfaced
2. **He pivots to a vertical where he has founder-market fit** - DevOps/SRE tools, cloud infrastructure, IT operations where his 15+ years experience gives him credibility
3. **He brings on a co-founder with trades industry expertise** - Trades operator + technical founder = viable team

**Personal Observation:**

Krishna's coachability is exceptional (5/5). This is rare and valuable. Most technical founders are defensive about their gaps. Krishna openly says "I need help" and asks great questions.

The question is: Can coachability compensate for lack of founder-market fit? The framework suggests no - but a coachable founder can FIND founder-market fit by pivoting.

**The honest conversation:**
"Krishna, you're an exceptional technical founder and your coachability is rare. But selling AI voice agents to tradies when you've never worked in trades is like bringing a knife to a gunfight. Your competitors (Johnni.ai, Sophiie) may have weaker tech but they speak the language. Consider either (a) finding a co-founder with deep trades experience, or (b) pivoting to a vertical where YOUR 15 years of DevOps expertise gives you the credibility edge."

## 12. Valuation Change Log

### v2.2 Re-Analysis (2025-12-03)

**Previous Analysis:** v2.1 (2025-12-03)
**Updated Analysis:** v2.2 (2025-12-03)

| Element | v2.1 Value | v2.2 Value | Change | Reason |
|---------|------------|------------|--------|--------|
| **Berkus Total** | $1,494K | $1,394K | -$100K | AI premium removed (does not meet 2/3 criteria) |
| **AI Premium** | +$100K | $0 | -$100K | v2.2 requires 2/3: Proprietary Data, Model Performance, Workflow Lock-in. ControlShiftAI met 0/3. |
| **Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty** | -15% | -17.5% | -2.5% | v2.2 variable penalty for SMB direct sales (tradies) without industry background |
| **Section B Modifier** | -14% (noted as replaced) | N/A (skipped) | Clarified | v2.2 explicitly clarifies Section B only for companies WITH traction |
| **Pre-Reality Check Range** | $1.7M-$2.6M | $1.6M-$2.6M | -$100K lower bound | Lower Berkus due to AI premium removal |
| **Final Range** | $500K-$750K | $500K-$750K | **Unchanged** | Idea-Stage Cap ($500K-$800K) is binding constraint |

**New Section Added:** F. Ownership Sanity Check
- Market-implied pre-money: $1.0M - $4.5M (based on likely $250K-$500K raise at 10-20% dilution)
- Framework output ($500K-$750K) is 50%+ below market mid-point
- Alignment Status: GAP - founder education required on AI wrapper valuations

**Key v2.2 Findings:**
1. ControlShiftAI does NOT qualify for AI premium under v2.2 criteria (0/3 met)
2. SMB direct sales penalty is higher than originally applied (-17.5% vs -15%)
3. Final valuation unchanged because Idea-Stage Cap is the binding constraint
4. Ownership Sanity Check reveals potential valuation expectation gap with founder
