## 6. My Notes & Observations

### Hypotheses to Test
> - What exactly does "Tradie Scribe" do? Documentation? Quoting? Admin?
> - How many users and what's the traction?
> - What's the vibe-coded product like technically?
> - What do they need most - product, GTM, or both?

### Red Flags
> - Agency relationship issues (though they overcame it)
> - Vibe-coded product may have technical debt

### Opportunities
> - Classic founder-led sales setup (they know the customer)
> - Tradie market is large and underserved in AU
> - Can help them build systematic GTM

### Pattern Recognition
> - Domain expert founders building for their own industry
> - Resilient (overcame early obstacles)
> - Need help professionalizing the go-to-market

### Personal Notes
> - Blake connection creates warm intro
> - Winning pitch = they can tell their story
> - Two-founder team = good for early stage
