## 2. Deep Research

### 2.1 Company Background

Talvin AI was born from Code94 Labs, a tech services agency Newan started at age 19 during the pandemic (2020). The agency grew to 50 people with 135 clients across 13-14 countries, working with startups, enterprises, and government agencies.

**The Pivot Story:**
The agency hit a critical bottleneck - they couldn't hire engineers fast enough and started losing deals. After trying 5+ recruitment tools with no success, they built an internal voice AI recruiter. They used it for over a year to hire every engineer before commercializing.

In early 2025, they pivoted from services to product, scaled down the agency, and went all-in on Talvin AI. Built MVP in 8 weeks with 3 engineers.

### 2.2 Market & Industry

**Market:** Enterprise Volume Hiring / HR Tech / Voice AI
- Focus: APAC region (India, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka)
- Secondary: GCC region
- Target: Organizations with 20+ hires/month, building offshore teams

**Key Trends:**
- AI recruitment tools growing rapidly
- Voice AI emerging as category (beyond CV keyword matching)
- Enterprise offshoring to APAC driving volume hiring needs
- Screening interviews = 60%+ of hiring lifecycle (massive inefficiency)

### 2.3 Product/Service

**Core Product:** Voice AI Recruitment Agent ("Sally")

**Value Prop:** "We Simply Eliminate Screening Interviews with AI"

**How it works:**
1. Set up interview in 30-60 seconds, get shareable URL
2. AI conducts adaptive voice conversations with candidates 24/7
3. Scores skills & soft traits, generates insights
4. Delivers ranked shortlist to human recruiters

**Key Differentiators:**
- Voice-first (not CV keyword matching like Ashby/Workday)
- Adaptive conversations (not scripted Q&A)
- 100 interviews in 1-2 days vs. 1 month with 2-3 recruiters
- 10+ language support
- ATS integrations (Ashby, Indeed, LinkedIn, etc.)

**Product Maturity:** V1.4, GDPR compliant, enterprise white-labeling ready

### 2.4 Business Model

**Revenue Model:** Usage-based (per minute of AI interview time)

**Pricing Tiers:**
| Tier | Price | Volume |
|------|-------|--------|
| Starter | $149/month | Entry point |
| Growth | $299-$699/month | Scaling |
| Enterprise | Custom | High volume |

**Land & Expand:** Start at $149, quickly ramp to higher tiers. Some go direct to enterprise.

**Gross Margin Challenge:** Currently dependent on external AI infrastructure, margins low. Plan to build own voice infrastructure to increase GP significantly.

### 2.5 Growth Signals

**Traction (as of Nov 2025):**
- **3 paying enterprise customers** (real contracts, not pilots)
- **~$12K USD ARR** → targeting $30K by mid-Nov → $100K by Jan/Feb
- **25+ businesses signed up**, 15 key pilot accounts
- **100+ on waitlist** before launch
- **3-4 demos/week** (global, high quality)
- **#1 ranking** for "AI recruiter" on Google and ChatGPT searches
- **Inbound:** Anytime Fitness found them, signed up, paid without demo

**Enterprise Customers:**
| Customer | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Mindvalley | Board approval, rolling out | Met team in Malaysia |
| Sampath Bank (Sri Lanka) | Board approved | 4-month sales cycle, 650 interviews/month |
| JXG (Janashakthi Group) | Paying 3-4 months | Executive hiring across holding company |
| Anytime Fitness (Canada) | Paying | Pure inbound, office hiring |

**Fundraising:**
- Raising $1M pre-seed for 10% ($10M valuation)
- $200K committed from angels
- Minimum viable: $650K
- 25+ investor conversations, mix of reasons for not closing yet
- Use of funds: 65% Engineering, 25% Marketing, 10% Trial runs

### 2.6 Key Stakeholders

**Founder:**
- **Newan Vinthusa** (Founder & CEO, age ~24): Started Code94 Labs at 19, scaled to 50 people/135 clients. Products his team built have collectively raised $120M+ (Karmo, hallo theo). Experienced hiring pain firsthand. Handles sales, product direction.

**Strategic Advisor:**
- **Sampath Thrimavithana**: 25+ years HR experience, led talent transformation at Virtusa (27K employees), C-suite executive across 100+ enterprises globally. Key channel for Sri Lankan enterprise customers.

### 2.7 Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | HQ | Funding | Focus | Threat |
|------------|-----|---------|-------|--------|
| **Ribbon AI** | Canada | Funded | North America | HIGH (but different region) |
| **Hey Milo** | USA | Funded | North America | HIGH (but different region) |
| **Ashby/Workday** | USA | Large | CV screening only | MEDIUM (different approach) |

**Talvin's Competitive Advantages:**
- **APAC focus** - competitors focus on North America
- **Voice-first** - not CV keyword matching
- **Cost structure** - Sri Lankan engineering = massive runway advantage
- **Founder-led** - can meet APAC customers in person
- **Dogfooded** - used internally for 1 year before commercializing

**Positioning Gap:** Only non-funded startup on first page of AI recruitment searches.

### 2.8 TLDR

- **Agency-to-SaaS pivot done right**: Built tool internally for 1 year, validated before selling. Scaled down 135-client agency to focus on 3 SaaS customers.
- **Strong enterprise traction signals**: Real contracts with Mindvalley, Sampath Bank, JXG, Anytime Fitness. Not pilots.
- **APAC focus = competitive moat**: Competitors (Ribbon, Hey Milo) focus on North America. Talvin owns APAC.
- **Capital efficient**: Sri Lankan cost base = massive runway advantage. Not burning cash on ads.
- **GTM bottleneck**: Enterprise sales cycles slow, conversion from demos low. Needs enterprise sales motion.
- **Fundraising in progress**: $1M raise at $10M, $200K committed. Looking for strategic investors.

## 3. GTM Assessment

### Current State

**Sales Motion:** 100% founder-led, organic/inbound
- No paid ads
- SEO/GEO working well (#1 for key terms)
- Webinars with regional speakers
- Lead magnets (videos, eBooks, blogs)
- Partnership strategy with corporate trainers who have enterprise relationships
- Strategic advisor (Sampath) driving Sri Lankan enterprise pipeline

**Demo Volume:** 3-4 per week (global, quality over quantity)
- Most are enterprise or large organizations
- Very few SMEs/startups coming through

### What's Working

- **SEO/GEO** - Ranking #1 for "AI recruiter" organically
- **Enterprise customer logos** - Real validation, not pilots
- **Founder credibility** - Built 135-client agency, knows enterprise
- **Cost structure** - Can outlast competitors on runway
- **Strategic advisor channel** - Driving Sri Lankan bank pipeline

### What's Broken / Pain Points

**Tier 1: Critical**
1. **Low demo-to-close conversion** - Getting demos but not converting. APAC buyers don't say no directly, they ghost.
2. **Enterprise sales cycle length** - 4+ months for banks. Can't accelerate without proven playbook.
3. **No outbound motion** - Fully dependent on inbound/organic. No predictable pipeline.

**Tier 2: Important**
4. **Pricing too low** - GP margins thin due to AI infrastructure costs. Betting on costs decreasing.
5. **Fundraising taking time** - Distracting from customer acquisition. $200K committed but waiting for more.
6. **US market access** - No presence, can't do upfront annual contracts like US startups.

### Immediate Goals (Next 90 days)

1. Hit $100K ARR by Jan/Feb (from current $12K → $30K → $100K)
2. Close pre-seed round ($650K minimum, $1M target)
3. Close 5+ enterprise accounts in APAC
4. Convert pipeline (7 banks in discussions, waiting for first bank to go public)

### Strategic Goals (12 months)

- Scale enterprise sales with repeatable process
- Build own voice infrastructure (reduce costs, increase GP)
- Expand beyond APAC to GCC
- Consider Product Hunt relaunch (did one 6 months ago with less mature product)

### 2025-11-10 - Discovery Call (GTM & Fundraising)
**Attendees:** Sachee Perera, Newan Vinthusa
**Duration:** ~67 minutes (scheduled 30, ran long)
**Format:** Video call (Sachee in Bali)

**Key Discussion:**
- Deep dive into Code94 Labs → Talvin pivot story
- Discussed current traction: $12K ARR, 3 enterprise customers
- Explored GTM challenges: enterprise sales cycles, low conversion
- Fundraising: $1M at $10M, $200K committed, looking for strategic investors
- Discussed mid-market vs enterprise strategy (agreed enterprise is right play)
- Explored second product idea (candidate marketplace/sourcing) - advised to stay focused
- WhatsApp career coach idea - Sachee liked this as low-lift experiment

**Metrics Surfaced:**
- $12K USD ARR → $30K by mid-Nov → $100K by Jan/Feb
- 3 paying enterprise customers (Mindvalley, Sampath Bank, JXG, Anytime Fitness)
- 3-4 demos/week, mostly global enterprise
- Conversion rate: low (APAC buyers don't say no, they ghost)
- 7 banks in pipeline waiting for first mover

**Key Insights from Newan:**
- "Speed is the weapon" - agreed on urgency
- Very intentional about investor selection (values > money)
- Won't change business model just for investor preferences
- Worst case: close at $650K instead of $1M

**Action Items:**
- [x] Newan: Send pitch deck via email
- [x] Sachee: Review and offer enterprise sales advisory
- [x] Sachee: LinkedIn shoutout to surface investors
- [x] Sachee: Blog post about Talvin pivot story
- [ ] Newan: Consider Product Hunt relaunch
- [ ] Discuss formal engagement if interested

**My Observations:**
> Best positioning/pitch of all founder interviews I've done in the past 2 weeks. Clear story, real traction, not chasing vanity metrics. The pivot from 135 clients to 3 shows discipline. He's thinking long-term (building own voice infrastructure for margin expansion). Main bottleneck is enterprise sales motion - exactly what I can help with. Very coachable, values-aligned.

## 6. My Notes & Observations

### Hypotheses to Test

1. **Outbound can unlock enterprise pipeline** - Currently 100% inbound/organic. A focused top-100 list with tailored outreach could accelerate.
2. **Sales process optimization can improve conversion** - APAC buyers ghost, need better qualification and follow-up cadence.
3. **Pricing is too low** - Should test higher price points with new customers. Current customers locked in, but new ones could pay more.
4. **First bank going public will trigger domino effect** - 7 banks waiting on sidelines. Social proof is the unlock.

### Red Flags

1. **Low conversion from demos** - Getting eyeballs but not closing. Need to understand why.
2. **Fundraising distraction** - Every week spent fundraising is time not closing customers.
3. **Margin pressure** - Dependent on AI costs decreasing. If they don't, GP stays thin.
4. **Single-founder risk** - Newan doing sales + product. No co-founder mentioned.

### Opportunities

1. **Enterprise sales advisory** (HIGH VALUE) - Exactly my wheelhouse. Can help install outbound motion, improve conversion.
2. **LinkedIn content** (DONE) - Already delivered value via post (6K+ impressions) and blog
3. **Investor introductions** - If I find aligned investors in network
4. **Positioning refinement** - "Voice infrastructure for enterprise hiring" is good, could be sharper

### Pattern Recognition

- Similar to CorePlan: enterprise sales with long cycles, need founder-led motion with process
- Similar to MyTab: great product, needs GTM help to scale
- "Build for yourself first" = textbook product-market fit de-risking
- APAC enterprise = relationship-driven, need in-person touchpoints

### Personal Notes

- Connected via Amani referral (Sri Lankan startup community)
- Newan is young (24) but mature in thinking - not chasing hype
- Very impressed by discipline of shutting down 135-client agency
- "To infinity and beyond" - good energy, coachable
- I genuinely want to help this one succeed
