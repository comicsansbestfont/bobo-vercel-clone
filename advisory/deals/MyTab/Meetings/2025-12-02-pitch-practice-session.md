# 2025-12-02 - Pitch Practice Session

**Attendees:** Sachee Perera, Mikaela Greene
**Duration:** ~63 minutes
**Format:** Zoom video call with screen share
**Purpose:** Pitch deck review and practice before Dec 5 Purpose Ventures pitch

---

## Summary

Mikaela presented full pitch deck with slide share and app demo. Strong presentation delivery - doesn't drone, keeps attention. Substance around takeaway focus is compelling. Identified several gaps that investors will probe on: valuation mismatch, unit economics clarity, and national vs WA strategy.

---

## Pitch Highlights (What's Working)

1. **Presentation style**: Clear, engaging, doesn't lose the audience
2. **Takeaway positioning**: "Hospitality's most frequent ordering behavior" - strong angle
3. **Competitive benchmark**: Crooked Carrot vs me&u comparison ($57.55 vs $43.23 avg spend = 33% uplift) - very compelling
4. **Customer retention data**: Repeat ordering curves are impressive (49% repeat at Peco Peco)
5. **Bootstrap story**: Two pro surfers, bootstrapped, capital-efficient - good founder narrative
6. **App demo**: Order Again feature and customer segments (43+ segments) showcase product depth

## Key Metrics Surfaced

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Active Venues | 16 | Down from 21 - 4 went into administration (not churn, business closures) |
| Current MRR | ~$2,000 | Acknowledged as artificially depressed due to no marketing spend |
| ARR | ~$24,000 | At 10x multiple = $240K valuation |
| Top Venue GMV | $247K | Crooked Carrot (12-month annualized) |
| Avg Spend Benchmark | $57.55 vs $43.23 | MyTab vs me&u at same venue (33% uplift) |
| FY24 Burn | ~$3,500 loss | Extremely capital efficient |
| Premium+ Adoption | 30% | Venues using docket printing/POS integration |

## Critical Questions Raised (Investor Perspective)

### 1. Revenue Clarity Gap
- "What does $247K GMV translate to in actual revenue to you?"
- Need to clearly articulate: GMV → Take rate → Actual revenue
- Currently MRR discussion is vague - need to own the $2K figure and explain pilot context

### 2. Valuation Mismatch
- Asking for $1M at $6M post-money valuation
- At $24K ARR, 10x multiple = $240K valuation
- Even at 20x = $480K valuation
- "You said you don't want to give up more than 20%, but the math doesn't work"
- VC market has collapsed - 7-10x multiples now, not 22x from 2021-2022

### 3. National Strategy Before WA Dominance
- "Why raise to go national when you haven't dominated the home state?"
- Mikaela acknowledged original plan was WA stranglehold, but mentors advised "get east ASAP"
- Sachee challenged this: Each state is different market (labor, associations, POS relationships)
- Recommendation: "Save the cheerleader, save the world" - own WA first

### 4. Go-to-Market Repeatability
- "How did you get these 16 venues? Why did others say no?"
- Drop-off is getting the meeting (not closing)
- No structured sales playbook documented
- Need to prove scalable acquisition before raising to scale

### 5. Product-Market Fit Validation
- Are early partners the actual ICP or just early adopters?
- Where are you on the adoption curve? Early traction vs. crossed the chasm?
- Risk: Raise $1M, hit feature gap chasm, burn cash without growth

---

## Strategic Recommendations Given

### 1. Reframe the Raise
> "What is the minimum you need to prove your next milestone?"

- Don't ask for $1M if you can prove the next stage with $300K
- What's the specific milestone? (e.g., 200 venues in WA vs. 550 national)
- Capital efficiency story is an asset - lean into it

### 2. WA-First Strategy
- Dominate WA before going national
- Different states = different markets, associations, POS relationships
- Build the moat, create raving fans, then expand
- "Proud West Aussie startup" persona

### 3. Commercial ROI Approach
- Peace Pizza: $65K incremental revenue in 7 months - how was this calculated?
- Can you prove ROI vs. me&u, HungryHungry?
- This helps both investor pitch AND venue sales

### 4. Founder-Led Sales First
- You must solve sales yourself before hiring salespeople
- You know the problem, the product, the customer better than anyone
- Hire to scale what works, not to figure out what works

### 5. Simple Strategy Over Complex
- Less is more - don't try to solve all states at once
- Focus on the process: "Next heat, not the final"
- Strategy will evolve - start simple

## Sachee-isms Applied

- **"Save the cheerleader, save the world"** - Own WA beachhead before national expansion
- **Capital efficiency** - Bootstrap story is an asset, not a liability
- **Founder-led sales** - You solve it first, then hire to scale
- **Simple strategy** - Focus on next milestone, not the $10M endgame

## Deal Status Update

**Deal Stage:** Relationship Development (unchanged)

**Observations:**
- Mikaela remains highly coachable - explicitly welcomed harsh feedback
- Surfing coach analogy: "You don't win the final by thinking about the final. You win by focusing on the next heat" - growth mindset
- She acknowledges the VC/fundraising space is new to them - values mentorship
- Real concern about hire-and-fire culture - wants to build sustainably
- December 5 Purpose Ventures pitch is upcoming - critical milestone

**Risk Flags:**
- Venue count down to 16 (4 went into administration - closures, not churn)
- Valuation expectations may be misaligned with market reality
- National expansion strategy may be premature
