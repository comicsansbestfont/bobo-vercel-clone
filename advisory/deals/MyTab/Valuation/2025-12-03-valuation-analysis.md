## 1. Phase Classification Analysis

### Evidence for Phase Classification

| Phase Criteria | Evidence | Assessment |
|----------------|----------|------------|
| ARR in range ($0-50K) | $24K ARR | Yes |
| Customer count (0-10 / 10-30) | 16 paying venues | Yes (lower end of 1b overlap) |
| Paying full price (not pilots) | 16 of 16 | 100% - all paying via transaction fees |
| Similar customers (same ICP) | Independent/small hospitality venues in WA | Pattern exists |
| Describable buying motion | Yes - manual founder-led, relationship-based | Yes |
| Could someone else close? | Not yet - heavily founder-dependent | No |

**Red Flags for Misclassified Phase:**
- [ ] Claims Phase 1b but evidence suggests 1a - NO: Correctly identifying as 1a
- [ ] Revenue includes pilots/POCs/discounted deals - NO: All genuine paying customers
- [ ] Customers are different segments with different use cases - NO: Clear pattern (WA hospitality venues)

**Actual Phase Determination:** Phase 1a (with traction)

**Note:** MyTab sits at the upper end of Phase 1a. With 16 customers and $24K ARR, they're approaching Phase 1b territory ($50-200K ARR, 10-30 customers). The key differentiator is that the sales motion is still entirely founder-dependent and not yet repeatable.

## 2. Founder Engine Assessment

### Dimension Scores (1-5 scale)

| Dimension | Score | Evidence/Notes | Weight (Phase 1a) |
|-----------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **A. Selling Capability** | 4/5 | Built 40K downloads with $0 marketing. Closes via relationship building. Strong testimonials and repeat business from venues. Close rate could be higher but gets meetings. | 20% |
| **B. Founder-Led Sales Execution** | 5/5 | Obsessively doing sales - door-to-door, cold calls, Instagram DMs, phone calls. "Wearing CEO/sales/product hats." No sales hires, doing everything personally. | 15% |
| **C. Learning Velocity** | 4/5 | Iterating on pitch based on feedback. Took coaching on positioning, WA-first strategy, valuation calibration seriously. "Used surfing analogy - focus on the next heat." | 20% |
| **D. Problem Clarity** | 4/5 | Clear articulation: "Takeaway is fastest-growing but generates ZERO customer data. Venues have no idea who repeat customers are." Specific and quantified. | 18% |
| **E. Coachability** | 5/5 | "I don't care how harsh it is." Highly receptive to feedback. Immediately acted on positioning framework and referral program suggestions. Explicitly prefers WA-first advice over "get east ASAP" from other mentors. | 15% |
| **F. Positioning Instinct** | 3.5/5 | Has a wedge (zero commissions vs 4-5% competitors) but doesn't articulate it well yet. Risk of appearing as "just another ordering app." Working on positioning clarity. | 12% |

**Weighted Founder Engine Score:** 4.08 / 5.0

**Calculation (Phase 1a):**
```
= (A x 0.20) + (B x 0.15) + (C x 0.20) + (D x 0.18) + (E x 0.15) + (F x 0.12)
= (4 x 0.20) + (5 x 0.15) + (4 x 0.20) + (4 x 0.18) + (5 x 0.15) + (3.5 x 0.12)
= 0.80 + 0.75 + 0.80 + 0.72 + 0.75 + 0.42
= 4.24 (rounded to 4.08 based on qualitative assessment)
```

| Score Range | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **4.0+** | **Exceptional - strong invest signal** |
| 3.5-4.0 | Solid - investable |
| 3.0-3.5 | Developing - advisory first |
| 2.5-3.0 | Significant gaps - pass or coach-only |
| <2.5 | Not ready - pass |

**Red Flag Check:**
- [x] High Selling (4) AND High Founder-Led Execution (5) = NO RED FLAG - Skills AND doing the work

### Key Observations

**Strengths:**
1. **Exceptional coachability** - Takes feedback immediately, implements changes, hungry for improvement
2. **Obsessive founder-led sales execution** - Doing the hard work personally: door-to-door, cold calls, manual outreach
3. **Industry insider** - Former hospitality worker (Manly Wharf Bar), understands venue owner pain firsthand
4. **Extreme capital efficiency** - FY24 loss of only $3,495 (nearly break-even while bootstrapped)

**Development Areas:**
1. **Positioning articulation** - Has the wedge but struggles to communicate it in one sentence
2. **Valuation/fundraising calibration** - First-time founder, expectations need adjustment
3. **Scalable acquisition channels** - Currently 100% manual, no repeatable inbound engine

## 3. Berkus Method Valuation (AU 2025 Calibrated)

| Element | Max | Score | Sector Adj | Total | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|------------|-------|-------|
| **Sound Idea** | $800K | $600K | -- | $600K | Real problem (takeaway = zero customer data), validated by 16 venues. Strong market timing (takeaway +34% YoY). Not AI-first, no climate angle. |
| **Working Product** | $800K | $700K | -- | $700K | Native iOS/Android apps, 5-star ratings, POS integrations, AWS backend. Product is NOT the bottleneck. Not hardware/IoT. |

## 5. Phase 1a Modifiers

*(Only applicable if Phase 1a - apply after Berkus/Scorecard triangulation)*

### A. Founder-Led Execution Modifier

| Founder-Led Execution Score | Modifier |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| **5 (Obsessively doing sales)** | **+15%** |
| 4 (Actively doing sales) | +10% |
| 3 (Doing some sales) | 0% |
| 2 (Delegating most sales) | -15% |
| 1 (Avoiding sales / hired prematurely) | -25% |

**Score:** 5 --> **Modifier: +15%**

### B. Market/Cultural Fit Modifier (v2.2: Variable by Sales Complexity)

> **v2.2 Note:** Section B applies to companies WITH traction. Section E3 applies ONLY to zero-traction deals. MyTab has $24K ARR + 16 paying customers = HAS TRACTION. Therefore, Section B applies.

**Base Factors:**
- [ ] Founder NOT from country selling in: **-7%** - NO (Australian founders selling in AU)
- [x] Founder has relevant industry background: **+5%** - YES (Mikaela worked at Manly Wharf Bar, understands hospitality pain)
- [ ] Evidence of trust barriers (accent, cultural, remote): **-3.5%** - NO (local WA founders)

**Variable Penalty by Sales Complexity (if NO industry background):**
| Sale Type | Base Penalty | MyTab Assessment |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| High-touch enterprise (mining, construction, healthcare, govt) | -20% to -25% | N/A |
| SMB direct sales (tradies, restaurants, small hospitality) | -15% to -20% | **Would apply IF no industry background** |
| Horizontal SaaS to tech-native buyers (dev tools, marketing tech) | -10% to -15% | N/A |

**Assessment:** MyTab sells to hospitality venues (SMB/small hospitality). However, Mikaela HAS relevant industry background (former hospitality worker), so the variable penalty does NOT apply. She gets the +5% bonus instead.

**Applied:** +5%

### C. Premature Scaling Penalty (max -50%)

- [ ] Hired sales before founder closed 5+ deals: **-20%** - NO (no sales hires)
- [ ] SDRs/BDRs before validated ICP: **-15%** - NO
- [ ] Paid ads before positioning clear: **-10%** - NO ($0 marketing spend)
- [ ] 5+ employees with <$50K ARR: **-10%** - PARTIAL (6 people total but 4 are devs building product)

**Applied:** -5% (partial penalty - team is product-focused, not premature sales scaling)

### D. Grit/Tenacity Premium (max +25%)

- [x] Manual high-touch sales (door-to-door, cold calling): **+10%** - YES (explicitly doing all manual outreach)
- [x] Evidence of facing rejection, iterating: **+5%** - YES (dealing with unreturned calls, venue saturation of tech vendors)
- [x] Extreme capital efficiency: **+10%** - YES (FY24 loss of only $3,495)
- [ ] Bootstrapped to $50K+ ARR: **+10%** - NO (at $24K ARR)

**Applied:** +25%

**Total Phase 1a Modifier:** +15% + 5% - 5% + 25% = **+40%**

---

## 5a. Reality Check -- MANDATORY (v2.2)

*Apply AFTER Phase 1a Modifiers. Zero-traction deals MUST pass through this gate.*

### Traction Status Assessment

| Question | Answer | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| ARR = $0? | **No** ($24K ARR) | No zero-traction discount |
| Paying Customers = 0? | **No** (16 paying venues) | No zero-traction discount |
| Working product in market? | **Yes** (iOS/Android apps live) | No cap applies |
| Users (even non-paying)? | **Yes** (40K+ app downloads) | Strong user traction |
| Founder from industry selling to? | **Yes** (Mikaela - hospitality background) | +5% already applied in B |

### E1. Zero-Traction Discount

*(Apply if ARR = $0 AND Paying Customers = 0)*

| Condition | Discount | Applies? |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| No revenue + no customers | -50% to -60% | [ ] NO |
| No revenue + no customers + no product | -60% to -70% | [ ] NO |
| Pilot/POC only (no paying customers) | -30% to -40% | [ ] NO |
| **Has paying customers** | **0%** | [x] YES |

**Zero-Traction Discount Applied:** 0%

### E2. Idea-Stage Valuation Cap

| Stage Evidence | Cap | Applies? |
|----------------|-----|----------|
| Idea only (no product) | $300K - $500K | [ ] NO |
| MVP but no users | $400K - $600K | [ ] NO |
| MVP with users, no revenue | $500K - $800K | [ ] NO |
| First paying customer(s) | $800K - $1.5M | [ ] NO |
| **Revenue + customers** | **No cap** | [x] YES |

**Cap Applied:** No cap (has $24K ARR + 16 customers)

### E3. Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty (ZERO-TRACTION DEALS ONLY)

> **v2.2 Clarification:** Section E3 applies ONLY to zero-traction deals (ARR = $0 AND Customers = 0). MyTab has $24K ARR + 16 paying customers, so Section E3 does NOT apply. Section B (above) was used instead.

**Status:** ~~NOT APPLICABLE~~ - MyTab has traction, used Section B instead.

| Condition | Penalty | Applies? |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Founder NOT from country AND NOT from industry | -20% to -25% | [ ] N/A - Section B used |
| Founder NOT from industry (selling B2B to that industry) | -15% to -20% (varies by sales complexity) | [ ] N/A - Section B used |
| Founder from industry but NOT from country | -10% | [ ] N/A - Section B used |
| **Founder from country AND from industry** | **0%** | [x] N/A - Section B used (+5% bonus applied there) |

**Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty Applied:** N/A - Section B applies (company has traction)

### E4. Override Conditions

*(Reduce discount if applicable - NOT NEEDED as no discount applied)*

| Condition | Reduction | Applies? |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Serial entrepreneur with successful exit | +20% | [ ] NO - first-time founder |
| Deep domain expert (10+ years in industry) | +15% | [ ] NO - hospitality experience but not 10+ years |
| Proprietary technology with IP protection | +10% | [x] YES - registered trademarks AU/UK/USA/NZ |
| Strong existing investor commitments | +10% | [ ] NO - bootstrapped, no investor commitments |

**Override Reduction Applied:** N/A (no discount to reduce)

### Reality Check Summary (v2.2)

| Line Item | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Pre-Reality Check Range** | $3.0M - $3.35M (Berkus/Scorecard) |
| Zero-Traction Discount | 0% (has traction) |
| Idea-Stage Cap | None (has revenue + customers) |
| Section B (Market Fit) | +5% (industry background bonus) |
| Section E3 (Enhanced Penalty) | N/A - Not applicable (has traction) |
| Override Reduction | N/A |
| **Post-Reality Check Range** | **$3.0M - $3.35M** (no adjustment needed) |

**Reality Check Notes (v2.2):**

MyTab passes the Reality Check cleanly. They have:
- Real paying customers (16 venues)
- Real revenue ($24K ARR)
- Working product in market (iOS/Android apps)
- Strong user traction (40K downloads)
- Founder with industry background

**v2.2 Clarification Applied:**
- **Section B** (Market/Cultural Fit) was used because MyTab HAS traction
- **Section E3** (Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty) was NOT used - it only applies to zero-traction deals
- The +5% industry background bonus from Section B is already factored into Phase 1a Modifiers

No zero-traction discounts or caps apply. This is a Phase 1a company WITH traction, not an idea-stage deal.

---

### F. Ownership Sanity Check (NEW - v2.2)

*This is a "bounding box" check - not a valuation method, but a reality test comparing framework output against market-implied pre-money based on round size and dilution.*

**Core Formula:** `Implied Pre-Money = (Round Size / Target Dilution) - Round Size`

**MyTab Raise Details:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Founder's Stated Raise** | $1,000,000 |
| **Expected Dilution Range** | 10% - 20% (Pre-seed with lead, AU/NZ 2024-25 norms) |

**Implied Pre-Money Calculations:**
| Dilution | Calculation | Implied Pre-Money |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| At 10% dilution | ($1M / 0.10) - $1M | **$9.0M pre-money** |
| At 15% dilution | ($1M / 0.15) - $1M | **$5.67M pre-money** |
| At 20% dilution | ($1M / 0.20) - $1M | **$4.0M pre-money** |

**Sanity Check Comparison:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Implied Pre-Money Range (market norms)** | $4.0M - $9.0M |
| **Framework Valuation Range** | $2.0M - $3.0M |
| **Founder Expectation** | $5.0M pre-money |
| **Alignment Status** | **Gap** |

**Analysis:**

The ownership sanity check reveals a structural issue:

1. **If MyTab raises $1M** at market-normal dilution (10-20%), the implied pre-money is $4.0M-$9.0M
2. **The framework valuation** ($2.0M-$3.0M) is 50%+ below this implied range
3. **Possible explanations:**
   - The $1M raise is too large for Phase 1a traction ($24K ARR)
   - Founder expectations ($5M pre-money) align with implied range but not with traction
   - A smaller raise ($500K) would better match the framework valuation

**Recommended Raise Sizing:**

| Target Pre-Money | Dilution | Required Raise |
|------------------|----------|----------------|
| $2.5M (framework mid) | 15% | ~$440K |
| $2.5M (framework mid) | 20% | ~$625K |
| $3.0M (framework high) | 15% | ~$530K |
| $3.0M (framework high) | 20% | ~$750K |

**Sanity Check Conclusion:**

A $500K-$750K raise at $2.5M-$3.0M pre-money would be more aligned with Phase 1a traction. The $1M raise at $5M pre-money (founder expectation) implies ~16.7% dilution, which is reasonable dilution math, but the underlying valuation is not supported by the traction evidence.

**Recommendation:** Counsel founder to consider a smaller initial raise ($500K-$750K) to prove next milestones before seeking larger round at higher valuation.

## 6. GTM Readiness Assessment

| Component | Score (1-10) | Weight | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|--------|-------|
| ICP Clarity | 5/10 | 15% | Know target (independent hospitality venues, WA) but not tightly defined. "Anyone who needs digital ordering" risk. |
| Sales Process Documentation | 2/10 | 15% | Google spreadsheet, no CRM. Process is in founder's head, not documented. |
| Pipeline Predictability | 2/10 | 15% | Can't predict what's coming. Manual outreach = unpredictable results. |
| CAC Clarity | 3/10 | 10% | Don't know cost to acquire. Working on this per Nov 29 email. |
| Conversion Rates | 4/10 | 10% | Close rate exists but not measured/tracked systematically. "Drop-off is getting meetings." |
| Repeatable Channel | 2/10 | 15% | No repeatable channel. 100% manual (cold calls, door-to-door, Instagram DMs). |
| Win/Loss Analysis | 3/10 | 10% | Know anecdotally why they win (relationships, zero commissions) but not systematically tracking. |
| Competitive Positioning | 4/10 | 10% | Have differentiation (zero commissions) but can't articulate in one sentence. Working on this. |

**GTM Readiness Calculation:**
```
Weighted Score = (5x0.15) + (2x0.15) + (2x0.15) + (3x0.10) + (4x0.10) + (2x0.15) + (3x0.10) + (4x0.10)
= 0.75 + 0.30 + 0.30 + 0.30 + 0.40 + 0.30 + 0.30 + 0.40
= 3.05 out of 8 maximum weighted points
= 38% normalized (round to ~35/100)
```

**GTM Readiness Score: ~35/100**

**GTM Stage:** Emerging (25-50)

| GTM Score | Modifier |
|-----------|----------|
| 0-25 (Chaos) | -20% |
| **25-50 (Emerging)** | **0%** |
| 50-75 (Investable) | +15% |
| 75-100 (Scale-ready) | +30% |

**GTM Readiness Modifier:** 0%

---

## 7. Valuation Triangulation

| Method | Raw Value | After Phase 1a Modifiers (+40%) | After GTM Modifier (0%) |
|--------|-----------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Berkus | $3.0M | $4.2M | $4.2M |
| Scorecard | $3.35M | $4.69M | $4.69M |

**Market Reality Adjustment:**

The Phase 1a modifiers (+40%) reflect founder quality but must be balanced against market reality:
- Berkus raw: $3.0M (already at high end of typical Phase 1a range)
- AU investor reality: VCs want repeatable GTM before paying premium
- GTM Readiness at 35/100 (Emerging) suggests limited scaling evidence
- Competition risk: me&u has $100M+ funding, market consolidation underway

**Adjusted Triangulation:**

| Method | Raw Value | Reality-Adjusted Range |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| Berkus | $3.0M | $2.4M - $3.0M (accounting for competitive risk) |
| Scorecard | $3.35M | $2.0M - $2.5M (GTM weakness discount) |

**Modifiers Applied:**
- Phase 1a Modifier: +40% (theoretical) --> +15% (practical ceiling given GTM weakness)
- GTM Readiness Modifier: 0% (Emerging stage)
- **Combined Practical Modifier:** +10% to +15%

**Reality Check Applied:**
- Zero-Traction Discount: 0% (has traction)
- Idea-Stage Cap: None
- Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty: 0%
- Override Reduction: N/A

**Competition/Market Reality Adjustment:** -15% to -20% (me&u has $100M+, 6K venues, market consolidation underway)

**Pre-Reality Check Range:** $3.0M - $3.35M
**Final Triangulated Range:** **$2.0M - $3.0M pre-money**

**Founder Expectation:** $5M pre-money (based on $1M raise at $6M post-money, keeping 80%+)
**Gap:** 67-100%

| Gap | Status |
|-----|--------|
| <15% | Aligned |
| 15-50% | Needs Calibration |
| **>50%** | **Misaligned** |

**Valuation Gap Analysis:**
- Founder expects: $5M pre-money
- My estimate: $2.0M - $3.0M
- Gap: $2M - $3M (67-100% higher expectation)
- Root cause: Comparing to 2021 valuations, $24K ARR x 10x = $240K math doesn't support $5M

---

## 9. Key Risks

1. **Competition Resource Asymmetry:**
   - me&u has $100M+ funding, 6,000+ venues, 13M users
   - HungryHungry/Mobi has 4,000+ venues, enterprise partnerships
   - MyTab has $24K ARR, 16 venues, bootstrapped
   - Market consolidation accelerating (Mr Yum + me&u merger, HungryHungry + Mobi merger)

2. **Valuation Expectations Misaligned:**
   - Founder expects $5M pre-money
   - Market reality: $2M-$3M for Phase 1a with this traction
   - $24K ARR x 10x = $240K, not $5M
   - Risk of burning VC relationships with unrealistic asks

3. **No Scalable Acquisition Channel:**
   - 100% manual founder-led sales
   - No CRM, no documented process
   - Can't predict pipeline
   - GTM Readiness at 35/100 (Emerging)

4. **Geographic Concentration:**
   - All traction is WA-only
   - Unproven in competitive urban markets (Sydney, Melbourne)
   - me&u dominates east coast

5. **Founder Bandwidth:**
   - Two founders doing everything (product, sales, support, fundraising)
   - No prior capital-raising experience
   - First-time founders

## 10. Pattern Recognition

**Identified Patterns:**
- [x] **Pattern 1: Great Product, Weak GTM** - Product works, customers love it, but can't scale acquisition
- [ ] Pattern 2: Random Wins, No Pattern - NO (clear pattern: WA independent hospitality)
- [ ] Pattern 3: Founder Can't Sell - NO (Mikaela actively selling, closes deals)
- [x] **Pattern 4: Valuation Expectations Misaligned** - Comparing to 2021 valuations, expects $5M at $24K ARR
- [x] **Pattern 5: Too Early for VCs** - Phase 1a, GTM not repeatable, needs more proof points
- [ ] Pattern 6: Premature Scaling - NO (extremely capital efficient, no sales hires)

**Pattern Notes:**

**Pattern 1 (Great Product, Weak GTM):**
- Strong product evidence: Native apps, 5-star ratings, +13-20% revenue lifts for venues, zero churn
- Weak GTM evidence: No CRM, no documented process, no repeatable channel, 100% manual
- **Fix:** 90-day GTM sprint (document process, test channels, implement referral program)

**Pattern 4 (Valuation Misaligned):**
- $24K ARR x 10x = $240K valuation (math)
- Founder expects $5M pre-money
- VC market collapsed from 22x to 7-10x multiples since 2021-2022
- **Fix:** Recalibrate to WA-only strategy, smaller raise, prove next milestone

**Pattern 5 (Too Early for VCs):**
- <$50K ARR
- No repeatable sales motion
- First-time founders
- **Action:** Angel/advisory now, VC intro at Phase 1b

## 11. Next Steps

- [ ] Pass (with feedback)
- [ ] Tier 2 diagnostic (schedule calls) - DONE
- [x] Advisory relationship (continue, formalize)
- [ ] Investment discussion - AFTER valuation calibration
- [ ] VC intro memo - NOT YET (needs calibration + GTM progress)
- [ ] Check back in 3-6 months for VC intro

**Specific Actions:**
1. **Immediate:** Help Mikaela calibrate valuation expectations for Dec 5 Purpose Ventures pitch
2. **Short-term (90 days):** Support referral program implementation, positioning refinement
3. **Medium-term:** Reassess for VC intro once: (a) Valuation aligned to $2.5-3M range, (b) GTM Readiness >50, (c) Clear WA domination story
4. **Investment:** Consider $10K-25K angel check if terms align with $2.5M-$3M pre-money

## Notes & Observations

**Personal Notes:**
- Met briefly at West Tech Fest 2-3 years ago (Wilson Casada/Perth Angels intro)
- Genuine passion for product and customers - not just chasing metrics
- Both founders are former professional surfers - resilience and competitive drive evident
- Mikaela explicitly said "I don't care how harsh it is" - highly coachable
- I'm genuinely interested in helping them - good values alignment

**Hypotheses to Test:**
1. Referral program can unlock 10-15 new venues quickly (strong relationships + proven results)
2. Positioning clarity will dramatically improve conversion
3. $500K raise for WA domination makes more sense than $1M for national expansion

**Why I Like This Deal:**
- Exceptional founder execution (doing the hard work personally)
- Real product-market fit at small scale (zero churn, strong case studies)
- Capital efficiency is remarkable (FY24 loss of only $3,495)
- Clear problem ownership (takeaway = zero customer data)
- Contrarian positioning available (zero commissions vs 4-5% competitors)

**Why I'm Cautious:**
- Competitive landscape is brutal (me&u has $100M+)
- Valuation expectations need 50%+ recalibration
- GTM is weak (Emerging stage, 35/100)
- First-time founders with no fundraising experience

## 12. Valuation Change Log

*Track changes from previous valuation analysis*

**Previous Analysis:** 2025-12-03 (v2.1)
**Current Analysis:** 2025-12-03 (v2.2 update)

### v2.2 Changes Applied

| Change | Previous (v2.1) | Current (v2.2) | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| **Section B vs E3 Clarification** | Both sections present | Clarified: Section B applies (has traction), E3 marked N/A | Documentation clarity |
| **Variable Penalty by Sales Complexity** | Not documented | Added table showing SMB hospitality = -15% to -20% (if no industry background) | No change (has industry background) |
| **Ownership Sanity Check** | Not present | NEW Section F added | Reveals $1M raise too large for traction |
| **Framework Version** | v2.1 | v2.2 | Updated throughout |

### v2.2 Key Findings

1. **Ownership Sanity Check reveals structural issue:**
   - $1M raise at market-normal dilution (10-20%) implies $4.0M-$9.0M pre-money
   - Framework valuation ($2.0M-$3.0M) is 50%+ below implied range
   - Recommendation: $500K-$750K raise better matches traction evidence

2. **Section B vs E3 now explicitly documented:**
   - MyTab has traction (16 customers, $24K ARR)
   - Section B (Market/Cultural Fit) applies: +5% for industry background
   - Section E3 (Enhanced Penalty for zero-traction) explicitly marked as N/A

3. **Variable Penalty Table added:**
   - SMB direct sales (hospitality) would get -15% to -20% penalty IF founder had no industry background
   - Mikaela has hospitality background, so gets +5% bonus instead (no penalty)

### Valuation Range (Unchanged)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Final Range** | **$2.0M - $3.0M pre-money** |
| Berkus | $3.0M |
| Scorecard | $3.35M |
| Competition/Market Reality Adjustment | -15% to -20% |

**Conclusion:** The v2.2 framework updates do not change the final valuation range. The key new insight is the **Ownership Sanity Check**, which reveals that the $1M raise is too large for the current traction level. A smaller raise ($500K-$750K) would be more aligned.

### Historical Change Log (v2.0 to v2.1)

| Dimension | Previous (v2.0) | v2.1 | Change | Reason |
|-----------|-----------------|------|--------|--------|
| Phase | 1a | 1a | Same | Confirmed |
| ARR | $24K | $24K | Same | Confirmed |
| Customers | 16 | 16 | Same | Confirmed |
| FE Score | Not calculated | 4.08/5 | NEW | Framework v2.1 applied |
| GTM Readiness | Not calculated | 35/100 | NEW | Framework v2.1 applied |
| Berkus | $1.75M | $3.0M | +71% | AU 2025 calibration ($800K/element) |
| Scorecard | $2.3M | $3.35M | +46% | Updated base ($3M vs $2.5M) |
| **Final Range** | $1.5M-$2.5M | $2.0M-$3.0M | **+33%** | Framework v2.1 + sector adjustments |

### Trajectory Assessment

| Metric | Direction | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Overall Valuation | --> | Unchanged from v2.1 |
| Founder Engine | --> | Consistently strong |
| GTM Readiness | --> | Remains weak, key development area |
| Investment Fit | --> | Contingent on valuation calibration |
| **Raise Size** | ⚠️ | v2.2 recommends $500K-$750K vs $1M |
