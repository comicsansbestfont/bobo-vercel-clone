    *   **Takeaway (Blue Bar):** 34%
    *   **Dining Out (Purple Bar):** 8%
    *   **Delivery (Pink Bar):** 7%

**[Text]**
**Takeaway Orders Are Data Black Holes.**
**The highest-frequency behaviour gives venues the least data.**

*   Customers order takeaway nearly 2× more often than dine-in (every 5 days vs. 9).
*   Takeaway is surging: +34% YoY, outgrowing dining out (8%) and delivery (7%).
*   Yet takeaway is almost fully anonymous; walk-ins, phone orders, and delivery apps reveal no customer identity.
*   POS terminals only log the transaction, not the person behind it.

**The Industry Shift: From POS to Platform**
**Global e-commerce and embedded payments are outpacing POS terminal growth.**

*   Mobile drives 57% of global e-commerce, projected to reach 64% by 2030.
*   Smartphones are now the centre of commerce; where customers browse, order, and pay.
*   App-based ordering is the new normal; seamless, fast, and data-rich for venues.
*   QR codes are built for dine-in and delivery apps bolt on “pickup” without sharing customer data, leaving takeaway without a unified platform and venues without customer relationships or margin.

**MyTab’s Proven Monetization Model**
Multiple revenue streams already validated in pilot venues, ready to scale instantly.

| Revenue Stream | Description | Current & Future Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Customer Transaction Fees** | Order fees: $0.29 (orders <$10) or 2.9% (orders >$10). High frequency with strong cross-venue engagement. | Core revenue driver with high repeat transactions across multiple venues. |
| **Venue Pricing Structure** | Standard setup: No commission fees; Premium+ add-ons: Docket Printing (1%), POS Integration (1.5%). | 30% of venues have used Premium+ features. |
| **Upcoming: MyTab Ads (Q4)** | Prepaid in-app advertising campaigns, priced by objective & duration. Supported by WA Govt Grant. | Expected to become a substantial future income stream from both venues and third party advertisers. |
| **Fallback Subscription (Q4)** | $49/month charged to venues below $1,800 monthly order volume. | Will drive recurring revenue. |

We are also evaluating a tiered subscription model, similar to competitors such as LOKE, Bite, and Me&u, paired with 12-month minimum contracts to increase revenue stability and enhance the predictability of recurring revenue.

**[Text]**
**Revenue Opportunity Based on Verified Takeaway/QSR Performance**

Modelled using the average normalised 12-month GMV from MyTab’s top-performing ICP venues ($141k per venue).

| Market Share | Venues | Total GMV | Potential Revenue (2.9%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1%** | 550 | $77.5M | **$2.25M** |
| **2.5%** | 1,375 | $193.9M | **$5.62M** |
| **5%** | 2,749 | $387.7M | **$11.24M** |
| **10%** | 5,498 | $775.2M | **$22.5M** |

This projection focuses only on MyTab’s strongest and most consistent segment (QSR, takeaway and fast-casual venues) to model a conservative, evidence-based roll out strategy. Revenue is calculated only from the 2.9% customer service fee, yielding a conservative benchmark of $4,089 per venue per year and excluding subscription tiers, premium features and broader venue categories.

While other venue types (e.g. table-service cafe/wine bar outliers like Little Wave) have shown strong performance, they are not included in this financial model and represent additional upside beyond this roll out plan.

**Community Voices: Real Feedback, Real Change**

“We are more than happy with our current sales and growth, our online sales average spend per head is 10% more than it was prior to **MyTab** and general sales **20% more** than our previous online ordering partner.

But it is the inputs that set MyTab apart from others. The team are easy to communicate with, go the extra mile to ensure that everything goes as smooth as possible and go above and beyond to help and solve any problems that arise.

Our guests find it easy to find, download and the UI is intuitive, we thought our migration over to a new provider would create an uproar with our guests but with the quality of the product, communication and roll out from MyTab we had **no negative comments and was one of the easiest transitions I have encountered in hospitality.**”

— Stephen Murphy, Area Manager, Peko Peko Feel Good Food

“We have been extremely impressed with our partnership with MyTab as an online ordering platform.

From the first point of contact Mikaela and Eliza worked around our schedules for appointments – not an easy task given I work as a commercial banker on top of the pizza shop!

The results speak for themselves. Since implementation we’ve **generated an additional $65k in revenue** via online orders over a 7 month period or 13% over the prior year.

We did a heap of research and calling before we decided on a partner for our online ordering platform and we **honestly could not be more stoked with our decision to partner with MyTab.**”

— Luke Pearce, Owner, Peace Pizza
