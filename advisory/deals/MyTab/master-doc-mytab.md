---

## 2. Deep Research

### 2.1 Company Background

MyTab was founded by sisters Mikaela and Eliza Greene, both former professional surfers. The idea emerged while Mikaela was working at Manly Wharf Bar in Sydney (2019-2020), experiencing firsthand the pain of anonymous takeaway customers and inefficient ordering.

They bootstrapped the entire development using savings and government grants, building native iOS/Android apps, a web-based venue management portal, and AWS cloud backend. The company has been operating in pilot mode across WA since 2021.

**Awards & Recognition:**
- Xero Australia's FY23 National Emerging Small Business of the Year
- Business News 40under40 Award (2023)
- BCCI Rising Star & Young Entrepreneur Awards (2022-23)
- WA Government Innovation Booster Grant winners (2023 & 2024)

### 2.2 Market & Industry

**Market:** Australian Hospitality (specifically Fast Food & Takeaway)
- Total hospitality industry: **$89.7B** across 91,071 venues
- Fast Food & Takeaway (primary target): **$29.7B**
- Market composition: 90%+ are SMBs (19 employees or less)

**Key Trends:**
- Takeaway orders growing **+34% YoY** (vs dining out 8%, delivery 7%)
- Mobile e-commerce will be **64% of all transactions by 2030**
- Post-COVID, digital ordering now table stakes (not nice-to-have)
- Market consolidation happening (Mr Yum + me&u merger, HungryHungry + Mobi merger)

**Problem Being Solved:** Takeaway is the fastest-growing order type but generates ZERO customer data. Venues have no idea who their repeat customers are, can't market to them, and can't build loyalty.

### 2.3 Product/Service

**Core Value Prop:** "Sell more, market smarter, know your customers"

All-in-one SaaS platform combining:
1. **Digital Ordering**: Web/app for table service, pickup, takeaway with visual menus, two-tap reorders, Apple/Google Pay
2. **In-App Advertising**: Targeted campaigns across 43+ hospitality customer segments (launching Q4 2025, grant-funded)
3. **Analytics & Insights**: Real-time management portal with customer identity, lifetime value, segmentation

**Key Differentiator:** Transforms anonymous takeaway customers into identified, loyal, high-value repeat customers. Venues OWN the customer data (vs. delivery platforms that control it).

**Product Maturity:** Strong. Native iOS/Android apps, 5-star App Store ratings, extensive POS integrations, reliable infrastructure. Product is NOT the bottleneck.

### 2.4 Business Model

**Revenue Streams:**
| Stream | Model | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Customer Transaction Fees | $0.29 per order (<$10) or 2.9% (>$10) | Core revenue, validated |
| Venue Premium+ Features | Docket printing (1%), POS integration (1.5%) | 30% of venues using |
| MyTab Ads | Prepaid in-app advertising campaigns | Q4 2025 launch |
| Fallback Subscription | $49/month for venues <$1,800 monthly volume | Recurring revenue |

**Key Pricing Philosophy:** Zero commission on base tier (major differentiator vs. me&u's 4-5%). Venue-friendly model.

**Current Revenue Reality:** ~$2K MRR ($24K ARR) - significantly under-represents value delivered due to transaction-based model not yet fully capturing recurring potential.

### 2.5 Growth Signals

**Traction Metrics:**
- **40,000+ app downloads** (WA only, $0 marketing spend)
- **$2.6M+ customer orders processed** (2021-2025)
- **16 active venues** (down from 21 - 4 went into administration, closures not churn)
- **Zero venue churn** reported (closures were business failures, not MyTab-related)

**Best-Performing Venue Case Studies:**

| Venue | 12M GMV | Avg Spend | Repeat Rate |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| The Crooked Carrot | $247,293 | $57.55 | High |
| Peko Peko Scarborough | $216,000 | $44.51 | 49% (10+ orders) |
| Peace Pizza | $254,542 | $71.95 | 36% (10+ orders) |

**Revenue Impact Evidence:**
- Peace Pizza: +$65K incremental revenue in first 7 months (+13% total revenue)
- PECO Sushi: Top customer LTV of $2,387 over 128 orders
- Customer engagement: 70% opt into marketing

### 2.6 Key Stakeholders

**Founders:**
- **Mikaela Greene** (CEO, age 29): Former pro surfer, first-time founder, wearing CEO/sales/product hats. Highly coachable, self-aware about gaps. Based in Yallingup, WA.
- **Eliza Greene** (Co-Founder): Sister, also ex-pro surfer. Handles ops and product alongside Mikaela.

**Dev Team:** 4 developers (1 backend, 1 DevOps, 1 iOS, 1 Android) - technical foundation is solid.

**Key References:**
- Luke Pearce (Owner, Peace Pizza) - strong advocate
- Stephen Murphy (Area Manager, Peko Peko) - can attest to service quality

### 2.7 Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Scale | Key Advantage | Pricing | Threat |
|------------|-------|---------------|---------|--------|
| **me&u** (merged Mr Yum) | 6,000+ venues, 13M users, $250M valuation | Network effects, massive funding (~$100M raised) | 4-5% commission | HIGH |
| **HungryHungry/Mobi** | 4,000+ venues | Enterprise partnerships, POS integrations | SaaS + ~5% commission | HIGH |
| **LOKE** | 50+ team, 10+ years | Loyalty-first, enterprise positioning | Enterprise SaaS | MEDIUM |
| **Bopple** | Moderate | Low fees (~5.9%) | Flat fee per order | MEDIUM |

**MyTab's Competitive Advantages:**
- **Zero commissions** (huge for independent venue owners)
- **All-in-one loyalty + ordering** (baked in, not bolted on)
- **Consumer community + in-app ad network** (unique monetization)
- **Local WA dominance** (home turf advantage)
- **Founder story & personal touch** (trust with independents)

**Positioning Gap:** Risk of appearing as "just another ordering app." Opportunity to own "Community-driven platform for independent venues" narrative.

### 2.8 TLDR

- **Strong product-market fit at small scale**: Venues report +13-20% revenue lifts, 5-star ratings, high retention. 40k+ app users, proven results
- **Competitive edge**: Zero commission fees, built-in loyalty/marketing tools, unique in-app ad network. More venue-friendly than me&u
- **Marketing is the bottleneck**: Growth has been entirely manual (cold calls, door-to-door). Minimal brand awareness, no organic inbound leads
- **Crowded market**: Competing against well-funded rivals (me&u $100M raised). Need sharp positioning to break through
- **Founder bandwidth stretched**: Two founders juggling product, sales, support, and fundraising with no prior capital-raising experience

---

## 3. GTM Assessment

### Current State

**Sales Motion:** 100% founder-led, relationship-based sales
- Manual outreach: cold calls, door-to-door, Instagram DMs, phone calls
- Google spreadsheet for tracking (no CRM)
- Typical onboarding takes 3-4 meetings to build trust (SME hospitality behavior)
- Venue owners notoriously busy; unreturned calls/emails are norm
- Saturation of competing tech vendors approaching venues daily

**What This Means:** They're doing things that don't scale (good at this stage) but have no repeatable acquisition channel.

### What's Working

- **Product delivers real value**: 13-20% revenue increases, high repeat rates, strong testimonials
- **Customer retention**: Zero venue churn reported
- **Founder relationships**: Personal touch resonates with independent venue owners
- **Capital efficiency**: Bootstrapped, lean team, 2024 loss of only -$3,495 (extremely efficient)
- **Technical foundation**: Solid product, native apps, POS integrations ready

### What's Broken / Pain Points

**Tier 1: Critical**
1. **Lead generation bottleneck**: Top-of-funnel problem. Can't break through noise to reach venue owners. Manual methods don't scale.
2. **Positioning clarity**: Can't articulate UVP in one sentence. Website tagline vague. Not differentiating from competitors.
3. **No scalable channel**: All growth via manual outreach. No organic inbound. No referral program active.

**Tier 2: Important**
4. **Pricing model under-captures value**: $2K/month doesn't reflect real traction. Need to move toward recurring subscriptions.
5. **Fundraising inexperience**: First-time founders, unclear on valuation, fearful about dilution and control.
6. **Founder bandwidth**: Two people doing everything - product, sales, support, fundraising.

### Immediate Goals (Next 90 days)

1. **Implement venue referral program** (committed to starting immediately post-call)
2. **Tighten positioning statement** using framework I provided
3. **Prepare for Purpose Ventures pitch** (was Nov 19 → now Dec 5)
4. **Validate 25 venues/month execution capability** (650/year target is unrealistic)
5. **Join hospitality associations** (RCA, AHAWA) for venue introductions

### Strategic Goals (12 months)

- Scale from 21 to 650 venues (target, but flagged as overly ambitious - needs recalibration)
- Raise $1M+ growth capital (also flagged as potentially too aggressive for current stage)
- Establish repeatable sales process (move away from founder-led manual sales)
- Introduce recurring subscription-based revenue model
- Launch MyTab Ads platform (Q4 2025, grant-funded)

## 4. Meeting Notes

*Extracted from /Meetings folder. Add new meetings at top.*

### 2025-12-02 - Pitch Practice Session
**Attendees:** Sachee Perera, Mikaela Greene
**Duration:** ~63 minutes
**Format:** Zoom video call with screen share

**Purpose:** Full pitch deck review and practice before Dec 5 Purpose Ventures pitch

**Key Discussion:**
- Mikaela presented complete pitch with slide share and live app demo
- Strong presentation style - engaging, doesn't drone
- Takeaway positioning and Crooked Carrot benchmark ($57 vs $43 me&u) are compelling
- Critical gaps identified: valuation mismatch, unit economics clarity, national vs WA strategy

**Metrics Updated:**
- Active venues now 16 (down from 21 - 4 went into administration, business closures not churn)
- MRR confirmed at ~$2,000/month ($24K ARR)
- FY24 burn was only ~$3,500 - extremely capital efficient
- 30% of pilot venues using Premium+ features (docket printing, POS integration)

**Critical Investor Questions Raised:**
1. Valuation mismatch: $24K ARR × 10x = $240K valuation, but asking $1M at $6M post-money
2. Why go national before dominating WA? (recommended: "Save the cheerleader" approach)
3. What does GMV translate to in actual revenue?
4. Is sales motion repeatable? Drop-off is getting meetings, not closing.

**Strategic Recommendations Given:**
- Reframe raise: What's minimum to prove next milestone?
- WA-first strategy before national expansion
- Take commercial ROI approach (prove value vs. competitors)
- Founder-led sales must come before hiring salespeople

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Mikaela: Answer unit economics questions from Nov 29 email
- [ ] Mikaela: Recalibrate raise amount for WA-only strategy
- [ ] Sachee: Talk to VC contacts and potentially forward deck
- [ ] Sachee: Available for West Tech Fest meetup (Perth from Friday Dec 6)

**My Observations:**
> Mikaela remains highly coachable - used surfing analogy: "You don't win the final by thinking about the final. You win by focusing on the next heat." Good growth mindset. Venue count down to 16 is notable but not alarming (closures, not churn). Valuation expectations need recalibration - VC market has collapsed from 22x to 7-10x multiples. The WA-first strategy resonated strongly with her. She explicitly said she prefers this approach over the "get east ASAP" advice from other mentors.

### 2025-11-10 - Discovery Call (GTM Health Check)
**Attendees:** Sachee Perera, Mikaela Greene
**Duration:** ~71 minutes (scheduled 30, ran long)
**Format:** Video call (Sachee in Bali, internet challenges)

**Key Discussion:**
- Deep dive into company history, current metrics, and pain points
- Diagnosed root cause: lead generation bottleneck (not conversion or process)
- Discussed fundraising strategy - $1M raise flagged as too aggressive for $24K ARR
- Explored venue acquisition channels: referrals, hospitality associations, founder-led sales
- Strong rapport built; both parties interested in ongoing advisory relationship

**Metrics Surfaced:**
- 21 venues, 40K downloads, ~$2K MRR
- PECO Sushi: $216K processed, $44.51 avg spend, 49% repeat rate, 70% marketing opt-in
- Peace Pizza: +$65K revenue in 7 months (+13%)

**Action Items:**
- [x] Mikaela: Implement venue referral program (committed to start "today")
- [x] Sachee: Send positioning framework via LinkedIn
- [x] Sachee: Send valuation/capital guidance
- [ ] Mikaela: Investigate RCA and AHAWA hospitality associations
- [ ] Mikaela: Refine 650-venue target to something defensible

**My Observations:**
> Mikaela is highly coachable, self-aware, and hungry. No ego issues. Strong product-market fit signals but stuck in founder-led sales mode. The bottleneck is clearly top-of-funnel awareness, not product or conversion. Founders are stretched thin but capital-efficient. Good advisory fit - I can add real value here on GTM strategy, positioning, and fundraising narrative.

## 6. My Notes & Observations

### Hypotheses to Test

1. **Referral program can unlock 10-15 new venues quickly** - They have strong relationships with 21 venues seeing real results. Simple incentive (1 month free?) could unlock word-of-mouth.
2. **Positioning clarity will dramatically improve conversion** - Currently can't articulate UVP in one sentence. Fixing this helps both sales and investor pitches.
3. **$1M raise is too aggressive for current stage** - $24K ARR × 10 multiple = $240-350K valuation. Asking for $1M is massively dilutive. Should raise smaller round, prove scaling, then raise larger.
4. **650 venues in 12 months is unrealistic** - That's 52/month average. Need to validate if 25/month is even executable split between two founders.

### Red Flags

1. **Valuation mismatch** - $24K ARR × 10x = $240K valuation, but asking $1M at $6M post-money. Math doesn't work with "keep 80%" goal.
2. **Overly ambitious fundraising ask** - Risk of burning capital without validating repeatable process
3. **No CRM or sales process** - Ad-hoc founder-led sales won't scale
4. **Geographic concentration** - All traction is WA-only. Unproven in competitive urban markets (Sydney, Melbourne)
5. **Competition resource asymmetry** - me&u has $100M+ funding, 6K venues, 13M users
6. **VC market reality** - Market has collapsed from 22x to 7-10x multiples since 2021-2022

### Opportunities

1. **Venue referral activation** (HIGH PRIORITY, LOW HANGING FRUIT) - Strong relationships + proven results = easy word-of-mouth
2. **Hospitality association channel** - RCA and AHAWA events = concentrated venue community with warm introductions
3. **Content/social proof marketing** - Strong case studies (PECO, Peace Pizza) not being leveraged
4. **Advisory relationship** - Clear fit for GTM strategy, positioning, fundraising narrative support

### Pattern Recognition

- Classic Phase 1a founder-led sales situation: product works, customers love it, but can't scale acquisition
- Similar to early CorePlan: strong product, complex B2B, relationship-based sales, needs systematic GTM
- Fits "Save the cheerleader" principle: should dominate WA independents before expanding nationally

### Personal Notes

- Met briefly at West Tech Fest 2-3 years ago (Wilson Casada/Perth Angels intro)
- Genuine passion for product and customers - not just chasing metrics
- Both founders are surfers - resilience and competitive drive evident
- Mikaela explicitly said "I don't care how harsh it is" - highly coachable
- I'm genuinely interested in helping them - good values alignment

### Deal Closure Notes (2025-12-11)

**Decision:** Declined to support the $750K raise or make VC introductions.

**Trigger:** Mikaela's Dec 11 email revealed new capital allocation strategy:
- $400K (53%) allocated to paid media (Meta/Google via Bonfire Marketing)
- Heavy reliance on performance marketing as primary GTM channel
- This conflicts with Sachee's experience of successful B2B hospitality unit economics

**What Was Delivered (Pro-Bono):**
- 71-minute discovery call (Nov 10)
- Positioning framework template
- 63-minute pitch practice session (Dec 2)
- Strategic coaching on TAM calculation, unit economics, and WA-first strategy
- Multiple follow-up emails with detailed feedback

**Key Data Uncovered:**
- GMV reporting error discovered ($2.6M → $1.77M actual)
- Strong retention: 32% repeat customers, 75.8% of orders from repeats
- 5:1 LTV:CAC ratio (above 3:1 benchmark)
- But: GTM strategy pivoted to paid media, not founder-led sales

**Door Left Open:** Offered to discuss advisory engagement if GTM strategy is restructured to a different acquisition model.
