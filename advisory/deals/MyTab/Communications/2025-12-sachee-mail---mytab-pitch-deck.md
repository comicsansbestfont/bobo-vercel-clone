## Summary

This is an email thread between Sachee Perera and Mikaela, from MyTab, discussing feedback and improvements needed for MyTab's pitch deck for investors. Sachee provides suggestions on TAM calculation, current state presentation, and the 'why now' question, while requesting data to strengthen the pitch.

## Key Points

- Clarification on TAM (Total Addressable Market) and calculation for investors
- Lead with bottom-up, not top-down approach to TAM
- Current state: Frame $2K MRR as deliberate R&D
- Address the "why now?" question
- Request for data: MAUs, order frequency, order concentration, revenue snapshot, CAC
- Sachee to float the updated deck to VCs and make introductions if there's appetite

## Extracted Content

apologies - clarification on the TAM. The headline on TAM is investors will want to know the total number of customers * the annual amount you think you can charge them. They will then want to do their own homework and see if their view aligns

1. TAM: Lead with bottom-up, not top-down

The $89.7B hospitality market figure is big, but investors often dismiss top-down TAM as totally made-up and would you build it from the ground up instead:

There are X QSR/fast-casual takeaway venues in WA. At $Y average annual revenue per venue for MyTab, that's $Z addressable in our beachhead. Nationally, that scales to [ this bigger number].

This shows you actually know the playing field. If you can pull the venue count numbers (back of the envelop numbers

2. Current state; Own the $2K MRR frame it as deliberate R&D

Make it apparent where you currently are and that it is intentional:

We ran a controlled pilot phase over 3+ years to deeply understand our ICP, validate retention patterns, and confirm fit before spending a cent on scale. That phase is complete. We now know exactly who our customer is, how they behave, and why they stay. This raise is to confirm the problem exists at scale and to unblock outreach."

This reframes it as your "de-risked investment."

3. The "why now?" question

This is your pivot from pilot. This is a question you will need to answer-why does it make sense for us to take action now and move faster; whats happenning in the world for it to make sense to invest.

Before our catchup (though dont go out of your way to do this) It would be really helpful if you could pull a rough cut of:

Out of the 40,000 downloads, how many are active customers (e.g. MAUs over the last 3/6/12 months)?
For an active customer, roughly how many orders they place and how often (per week or per month).
Where orders are concentrated – eg; top 5 venues as a % of GMV, and any clear locality clusters.
A simple revenue snapshot for MyTab: current MRR/ARR from transaction fees and any paid add-ons, and an average $ per active venue over the last year.
The cac and pay back is important but also at the same time irrelevant.. because its just you 2 however If you have it, even a rough sense of what it costs you to acquire and support a typical venue

If you could send the info we discussed in the call i'll then reach out to a couple of VCs I know and float the deck (i'll wait for you to update if you think you'd like to do so) to get their read. If there's appetite, I'll make intros.

MyTab helps hospitality venues turn anonymous takeaway orders into loyal, high-value customers, driving higher average spend and stronger retention. With 40,000+ customers and $2.6M processed in a controlled pilot, MyTab is now ready for national scale.

Another thing I forgot to mention during our chat: one of our pilot venues, Crooked Carrot cafe, shared with us their overall performance with a QR code competitor, me&u, which allowed us to benchmark directly and identify product improvements. What was particularly interesting is that while our total transaction volume was lower, our average customer spend was significantly higher: $57.55 with MyTab vs. $43.23 with me&u (a 33% uplift).
