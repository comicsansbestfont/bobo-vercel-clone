Hi Sachee,

Please find attached the general pitch deck. I adjust it slightly for each VC to ensure alignment with their focus areas, but this is the core template.

After our conversation, it highlighted to me that although I've always had a strong grasp of our data and a clear understanding of our Ideal Customer Profile, I realised I wasn't presenting the value of MyTab in a concise, externally-clear way. Getting an outside perspective helped me recognise where my template and messaging needed refinement so that the strength of our insights and our niche position in a saturated market comes across more effectively.

A short blurb about us is:

Mikaela and Eliza Greene are two former professional surfing sisters turned tech founders who have bootstrapped MyTab, a food and beverage ordering app that transforms occasional customers into weekly regulars.

MyTab helps hospitality venues turn anonymous takeaway orders into loyal, high-value customers, driving higher average spend and stronger retention. With 40,000+ customers and $2.6M processed in a controlled pilot, MyTab is now ready for national scale.

Another thing I forgot to mention during our chat: one of our pilot venues, Crooked Carrot cafe, shared with us their overall performance with a QR code competitor, me&u, which allowed us to benchmark directly and identify product improvements. What was particularly interesting is that while our total transaction volume was lower, our average customer spend was significantly higher: $57.55 with MyTab vs. $43.23 with me&u (a 33% uplift).

Looking forward to speaking with you soon.

Best regards,

Hi Mikaela,

Thanks for sending through the deck and the extra context in your email. It really comes through that you've got a strong grasp of the data and your customer.

There's a lot that's already working in the deck. The takeaway data black hole framing is strong, and the traction you're showing is exactly what most early-stage founders don't have. The Crooked Carrot vs me&u benchmark is particularly powerful; a 33% uplift in average spend against a known competitor is the kind of stat investors remember.

Where I think we can level this up for investors now is in connecting that story to a few simple, hard numbers underneath: how customers behave, how venues perform, and how much of the $2.6M actually flows through to MyTab. That's the "is this making real money today, and how scalable is it?" question they'll all ask. I think that's biggest gap for me.

Before our catchup (though don't go out of your way to do this) it would be really helpful if you could pull a rough cut of:

- Out of the 40,000 downloads, how many are active customers (e.g. MAUs over the last 3/6/12 months)?
- For an active customer, roughly how many orders they place and how often (per week or per month).
- Where orders are concentrated – e.g. top 5 venues as a % of GMV, and any clear locality clusters.
- A simple revenue snapshot for MyTab: current MRR/ARR from transaction fees and any paid add‑ons, and an average $ per active venue over the last year.
- The CAC and payback is important but also at the same time irrelevant... because it's just you 2. However, if you have it, even a rough sense of what it costs you to acquire and support a typical venue.

With those numbers, we can tighten the "hidden lifetime value in takeaway customers" story without changing who you are or what you're already doing well.

Many thanks,
Sachee

Hi Mikaela,

Thanks for running through the full pitch today – you presented really well. You have good preso skills (a rarer skill than you'd think!).

A few things circling in my mind afterwards that we didn't touch on properly:

**1. TAM: Lead with bottom-up, not top-down**

The $89.7B hospitality market figure is big, but investors often dismiss top-down TAM as totally made-up and would you build it from the ground up instead:

> There are X QSR/fast-casual takeaway venues in WA. At $Y average annual revenue per venue for MyTab, that's $Z addressable in our beachhead. Nationally, that scales to [this bigger number].

This shows you actually know the playing field. If you can pull the venue count numbers (back of the envelope numbers).

**2. Current state: Own the $2K MRR – frame it as deliberate R&D**

Make it apparent where you currently are and that it is intentional:

> We ran a controlled pilot phase over 3+ years to deeply understand our ICP, validate retention patterns, and confirm fit before spending a cent on scale. That phase is complete. We now know exactly who our customer is, how they behave, and why they stay. This raise is to confirm the problem exists at scale and to unblock outreach.

This reframes it as your "de-risked investment."

**3. The "why now?" question**

This is your pivot from pilot. This is a question you will need to answer – why does it make sense for us to take action now and move faster; what's happening in the world for it to make sense to invest.

I have a few more but will park it for another time!

If you could send the info we discussed in the call I'll then reach out to a couple of VCs I know and float the deck (I'll wait for you to update if you think you'd like to do so) to get their read. If there's appetite, I'll make intros.

Many thanks,
Sachee

Apologies — clarification on the TAM. The headline on TAM is investors will want to know the total number of customers × the annual amount you think you can charge them. They will then want to do their own homework and see if their view aligns.

Many Thanks,
Sachee

Hi Sachee,

Thank you so much for this information, I wanted to ensure I had all the information and our refined pitch before responding.

Additionally, in my initial message I referenced $2.7M in processed GMV which was shown on our admin dashboard. After exporting and manually auditing the raw transaction data for your questions, I identified a reporting discrepancy in that dashboard total. The underlying transactional records are accurate, the issue was with an aggregation display on that specific dashboard widget. I immediately flagged this with the devs and updated the reporting logic to prevent the mismatch going forward. The accurate processed amount ($1.77M) is the figure now displayed on the pitch deck. It was a complete shock when I figured it out, however I am glad that your questions uncovered the discrepancy so I could correct it as early as possible.

As discussed on our call, please find below the answers to your questions:

### Out of the 40,000 downloads, how many are active customers?

40,000+ downloads organically during the pilot. Despite very limited ordering opportunities due to limited venues, 16,935 customers placed successful orders, which is an install to purchase conversion rate of ~41%.

**Order Volume & Customer Activity:**
- 47,522 successful orders completed in pilot
- Jan–Nov 2025 averages:
  - 1,727 orders per month
  - ~1,010 monthly active ordering customers
- Active ordering customers window:
  - Last 12 months: 7,797
  - Last 6 months: 3,591
  - Last 3 months: 1,898

**Retention & Repeat Behaviour:**
- 5,452 repeat customers (≥2 orders) → 32.2% of all customers
- Repeat customers drove 36,039 orders, representing 75.8% of total order volume
- Strong early indicator of habit formation and product–market fit, even with limited venue supply.

### Where orders are concentrated?

Strong locality clusters around Dunsborough/Busselton and Scarborough. Top 5 localities account for ~92.5% of all activity, demonstrating high density where supply was available.

### Revenue snapshot for MyTab?

Current monthly revenue (MRR): ~$2,000

> We ran a controlled pilot phase over 3+ years to deeply understand our ICP, validate retention patterns, and confirm fit before spending a cent on scale. That phase is complete. We now know exactly who our customer is, how they behave, and why they stay. This raise is to confirm the problem exists at scale and to unblock outreach.

A more comprehensive breakdown is available in the pitch deck (attached).

### CAC and payback?

On the CAC side, I reviewed global benchmarks and the average CAC for B2B hospitality SaaS sits around $800–$900 USD (roughly $1,200–$1,300 AUD). Using Peko Peko Scarborough as an example:

- Lifetime GMV: ~$216k
- At a conservative 2.9% capture, that's $6,264 in MyTab revenue (excluding Premium+ features or future in-app ad revenue)
- This gives us an LTV:CAC ratio of ~5:1, significantly outperforming the typical healthy benchmark of 3:1.

### Capital Raise Strategy

After extensive discussions with several reputable marketing agencies, I have chosen to move forward with Bonfire Marketing (headquartered in Subiaco). Their team provided deep, data-driven insights into the ROI potential for our specific ICP, along with a clear strategy across dedicated B2B marketing channels. We also recognise that educating our ICP is critical to accelerating adoption, so we have allocated budget for both creative production and targeted marketing initiatives.

**Overview of our raise:**

We are raising $750k ($4M post, representing 18.75% equity) to onboard 200 WA venues over 18 months through a disciplined and fully validated acquisition model.

By focusing on WA, we operate in a contained, highly controllable market where we can win density, compress CAC, and build a defendable data moat before national expansion. This geographic strategy reduces execution risk and accelerates word-of-mouth, the #1 discovery channel for our ICP.

**At 200 venues, the business will demonstrate meaningful revenue scale:**
- GMV processed: 200 × $141k = $28.2M annually
- Base revenue at 2.9%: $817,800
- Premium+ uplift (30% adoption at +1%): $84,600
- Total annual MyTab revenue: ~$902,400

That means our 18-month raise builds an engine that generates more annual revenue than the total capital invested.

**The raise funds three critical systems:**

1. **A repeatable acquisition engine:** scaled Meta/Search + founder-led outbound delivering 11–17 venues/month.
2. **Product automation and UX improvements:** enabling us to support >200 venues without proportionally scaling headcount.
3. **Operational resilience:** infrastructure, compliance, and buffers that ensure stability as volume increases.

**Capital Allocation:**

**$400,000 – Performance marketing and creative production:**
- $20,000 per month in ad spend across social media (Meta) and SEO (Google) including GST and management fees ($360,000 total)
- $40,000 total for creative concept and production
- This will deliver 260–840 qualified clicks, 15–30 leads, and 5–10 new venues per month across Meta and Google.

**$180,000 – Founder-led onboarding and success:**
Because we know the product, workflows and customer behaviours better than anyone, Eliza and I can activate venues faster, minimise training overhead and ensure frictionless activation, deep adoption, and rapid feedback loops. Founder-led outbound as sales representatives adds 6–10 venues per month, giving us a reliable path to 200+ venues with high-touch, high-conversion execution.

**$100,000 – Product and data enhancements:**
Front-end UX, workflow improvements and AWS optimisation for speed, reliability and security. This investment expands automation so onboarding and support scale without increasing headcount proportionally.

**$70,000 – Operations and contingency:**
AWS, integrations, essential SaaS, compliance and insurance.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.

## 2025-12-11 22:39 – Outbound (Sachee → Mikaela) ⚠️ REJECTION

**From:** Sachee Perera <howdy@sachee.com.au>
**To:** MyTab Admin <admin@mytabinfo.com>
**Subject:** Re: MyTab Pitch Deck

Hi Mikaela,

Thank you for the transparency regarding the data correction and for providing the detailed answers to my questions.

I have reviewed your new plan and must be direct: **I am not comfortable supporting this raise or making introductions to my network.**

While the retention data and LTV:CAC ratio are promising, the capital allocation strategy... specifically the heavy reliance on paid media for your Go-to-Market channel presents a risk profile that conflicts with my experience of successful B2B hospitality unit economics.

I will therefore step back from assisting with your fundraising efforts so you can execute the chosen plan.

If, at a later date, you decide to restructure the GTM strategy and develop a different acquisition model, that is the professional work I specialise in. I would be happy to discuss an advisory engagement at that time.

Wishing you the very best with your venture.

Many thanks,
Sachee
