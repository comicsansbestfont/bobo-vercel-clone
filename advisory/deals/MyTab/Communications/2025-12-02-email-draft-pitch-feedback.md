Hi Mikaela,

Thanks for running through the full pitch today – you presented really well. You don't drone (a rarer skill than you'd think), and the takeaway positioning and Crooked Carrot benchmark landed exactly as they should.

A few things that stuck with me after we hung up:

**What's working:**
- The "hospitality's most frequent ordering behaviour" angle is sharp
- The 33% spend uplift vs me&u is your killer stat – keep that front and centre
- Your bootstrap/capital-efficiency story is an asset, not a liability. FY24 burn of $3,500 while building a product that works is impressive discipline.

**Where I'd tighten for Thursday:**

### 1. TAM: Lead with bottom-up, not top-down

The $89.7B hospitality market figure is big, but investors often dismiss top-down TAM as "totally a made-up number" (actual VC quote). Build it from the ground up instead:

> "There are X QSR/fast-casual takeaway venues in WA. At $Y average annual revenue per venue for MyTab, that's $Z addressable in our beachhead. Nationally, that scales to [bigger number]."

This shows you actually know the playing field. If you can pull the venue count numbers, I can help you frame this properly.

### 2. GMV → Revenue: Show the math

Walk them through the waterfall clearly:
- Crooked Carrot does $247K GMV
- MyTab take rate is X% (transaction fee + premium features)
- That equals $X revenue per venue per year
- Across your top 5 venues, that's $Y total

Then show: "At 100 venues doing similar volume, that's $Z ARR." Investors want to see that the unit economics work before they give you money to acquire more units.

### 3. Own the $2K MRR – frame it as deliberate R&D

Don't apologise for it. Position the pilot as intentional:

> "We ran a controlled R&D phase over 3+ years to deeply understand our ICP, validate retention patterns, and confirm product-market fit before spending a cent on scale. That phase is complete. We now know exactly who our customer is, how they behave, and why they stay. This raise is to confirm the problem exists at scale and to unblock outreach."

This reframes "low revenue" as "de-risked investment." You're not figuring it out – you've already figured it out. Now you're scaling what works.

### 4. The "why now?" question

This is your pivot from R&D to growth. The story is:

> "We've done the hard work – we know who our customer is, we know the product works, we know the retention patterns. What we haven't done is invest in reaching them at scale. That's what this raise unlocks."

It positions the capital as unblocking sales/outreach, not figuring out product. You're past the "will it work?" phase – you're in the "can we reach them?" phase.

### 5. WA-first framing

I'd expect "why not national?" to come up. Lead with the beachhead story:

> "We're focused on dominating WA first – it's our home turf, we understand the market dynamics, and we can move faster here. Once we've proven the model works at 100-200 venues, we replicate it state by state."

This shows strategic discipline. Investors love founders who say "we're going to own this market, then expand" rather than "we're going everywhere at once."

### 6. Show the growth levers

The most sophisticated founders know that acquiring new customers (WIN) is actually the *smallest* driver of ARR growth. The bigger levers are:
- **MONETIZE**: Expand within existing venues (more features, higher tiers)
- **RETAIN**: Referrals, reduce churn, increase stickiness

If you can show: "Our existing 16 venues generate $X, but with Premium+ adoption at 30%, there's $Y of expansion revenue we haven't captured yet" – that's more compelling than just "we'll acquire 550 new venues."

**Next steps – can you pull these numbers?**

For the bottom-up TAM and the unit economics story, it would help to have:
- Total number of QSR/fast-casual takeaway venues in WA (and nationally if you have it)
- Your take rate breakdown: what does a $247K GMV venue actually generate in MyTab revenue? (transaction fees + premium features)
- Top 5 venue revenue contribution – just to show concentration and scalability
- If possible: what's your cost to acquire and support a typical venue? (So we can talk CAC payback)

If you can get me those, I can help you build a tighter TAM slide and a simple unit economics one-pager before Thursday.

**On my end:**

I'm going to reach out to a couple of VCs I know and float the deck to get their read. If there's appetite, I'll make intros after you've refined based on Thursday's feedback.

I land in Perth Friday – let me know if West Tech Fest works or if you'd prefer a separate working session while I'm in town (Dec 6-12 window).

Good luck Thursday. You've got this.

Key insights incorporated from blog archives:

**From TheVentureCrew:**
- The "1% Market Fallacy" - bottom-up TAM is more credible
- "Vibe Revenue" warning - need cohort retention, not just overall metrics
- Beachhead market domination before geographic expansion

**From T2D3:**
- Founder-led sales is THE advantage at early stage
- The three ARR growth levers: MONETIZE > RETAIN > WIN
- CAC payback should be under 12 months
- Frame pilot as "R&D complete, now scaling"

**From TAM/SAM/SOM Article:**
- SAM = where you have best product-market fit
- SOM = what you can dominate with limited resources
- "If you cannot answer 'Can I win this market?', your market is too big"
