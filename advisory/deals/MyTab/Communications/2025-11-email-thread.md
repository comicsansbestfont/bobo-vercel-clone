Subject: Pitch Deck + Context

Hi Sachee,

Please find attached the general pitch deck. I adjust it slightly for each VC to ensure alignment with their focus areas, but this is the core template.

After our conversation, it highlighted to me that although I’ve always had a strong grasp of our data and a clear understanding of our Ideal Customer Profile, I realised I wasn’t presenting the value of MyTab in a concise, externally-clear way. Getting an outside perspective helped me recognise where my template and messaging needed refinement so that the strength of our insights and our niche position in a saturated market comes across more effectively.

A short blurb about us is:

Mikaela and Eliza Greene are two former professional surfing sisters turned tech founders who have bootstrapped MyTab, a food and beverage ordering app that transforms occasional customers into weekly regulars.

MyTab helps hospitality venues turn anonymous takeaway orders into loyal, high-value customers, driving higher average spend and stronger retention. With 40,000+ customers and $2.6M processed in a controlled pilot, MyTab is now ready for national scale.

Another thing I forgot to mention during our chat: one of our pilot venues, Crooked Carrot cafe, shared with us their overall performance with a QR code competitor, me&u, which allowed us to benchmark directly and identify product improvements. What was particularly interesting is that while our total transaction volume was lower, our average customer spend was significantly higher: $57.55 with MyTab vs. $43.23 with me&u (a 33% uplift).

Looking forward to speaking with you soon.

Kind regards,  
Mikaela

Subject: Deck Review + Metrics Request

Hi Mikaela,  

Thanks for sending through the deck and the extra context in your email. It really comes through that you’ve got a strong grasp of the data and your ICP – our chat just helped surface where the story needed to be clearer externally, which is completely normal at this stage.  

There’s a lot that’s already working in the deck. The “takeaway data black hole” framing is strong, and the traction you’re showing – 40,000+ customers, $2.6M processed, and the QSR/takeaway performance – is exactly what most early-stage founders don’t have. The Crooked Carrot vs me&u benchmark is particularly powerful; a 33% uplift in average spend against a known competitor is the kind of stat investors remember.  

Where I think we can level this up for investors now is in connecting that story to a few simple, hard numbers underneath: how customers behave, how venues perform, and how much of the $2.6M actually flows through to MyTab. That’s the “is this making real money today, and how scalable is it?” question they’ll all ask.  

Ahead of our session, it would be really helpful if you could pull a rough cut of:  
- Out of the 40,000 downloads, how many are active customers (e.g. MAUs over the last 3/6/12 months)?  
- For an active customer, roughly how many orders they place and how often (per week or per month).  
- Where orders are concentrated – e.g. top 5 venues as a % of GMV, and any clear locality clusters.  
- A simple revenue snapshot for MyTab: current MRR/ARR from transaction fees and any paid add‑ons, and an average $ per active venue over the last year.  
- If you have it, even a rough sense of what it costs you to acquire and support a typical venue (so we can talk CAC and payback).  

With those numbers, we can tighten the “hidden lifetime value in takeaway customers” story and build a clean unit economics / CAC narrative for Purpose Ventures and other investors, without changing who you are or what you’re already doing well.  

Looking forward to going through it together and helping you sharpen this for the next round of conversations.  

Many thanks,  
Sachee
