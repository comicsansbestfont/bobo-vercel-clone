Hi Sachee,

I hope you are well. My name is Mikaela, and I am the Co-Founder of MyTab, a West Australian based, female-founded mobile ordering app (iOS & Android) designed to streamline takeaway (collect-at-counter) and table service orders for venues. Customers can order and pay directly from their phones, resulting in fewer queues, faster service, and a smoother experience for both customers and staff.

My sister Eliza and I have bootstrapped our innovation, achieving a highly successful go-to-market pilot across regional and metropolitan WA, with over 40,000 customer app downloads and AUD$2.6M in order revenue processed through participating venues to date. While most early advice leaned toward scaling quickly, we deliberately focused on refining and polishing our product to ensure it was robust and ready for national growth.

We have secured registered trademarks in Australia, the UK, USA, and New Zealand, and we own all IP. Having poured our hearts into this innovation, we are not seeking just any investment, we're looking for the right strategic partner who can help us scale nationally/internationally through the right networks and expertise.

As a first time founder, I would love the opportunity to connect and receive any advice or mentorship from you regarding how best to navigate capital raising, to ensure we are making the best possible decisions for our business.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Mikaela Greene
Co-Founder | Technical Director

hi Mikaela, congratulations all your success. i may have come across your app now that i think about it.

Most people rush to scale before they've earned it, but you've clearly got the traction. Happy to chat

Hi Mikaela nice chatting with you - getting this to you asap so here's a positioning framework that'll help you nail down value proposition.

You can in these blanks to create your positioning statement:

**For** [specific venue type]

**MyTab is** [what you are - like order management platform or similar]

**That** [what you do]

**By** [how you do it differently]

**Unlike** [main competitor], **we** [your unique advantage]

I'd write 3 versions targetting different venue segments like cafes, vs wineries vs food trucks. Let me know what you come up with - happy to review with you :)

Many thanks, Sachee

Hi Mikaela, how did you go? I'm happy to do a mini 2 week sprint with you on this.

By the way are you going to west tech fest this year?

Hi Sachee, apologies for the delay in responding, I have just secured another meeting so I am working hard to de-risk the capital raise by strengthening the data surrounding our existing pilot venues. I want to make sure I am as prepared as I can possibly be. I was actually looking at the West Tech Fest tickets this morning, I was thinking of going to the main event on the 9th. I think we really need to start networking so people can see what we have achieved and where we are trying to take MyTab. I will try to send you through the positioning framework once I have really refined all the answers to the potential questions I can think of for these upcoming meetings. Thanks so much again for your advice 😊

Hey Mikaela, no need to apologise at all, sounds like things are moving which is great. Another meeting in the diary is a good sign.

I will be in Perth from the 4th to the 12th and planning to be around West Tech Fest on the 9th. While I am in town, how about we grab 60 to 90 minutes and do a proper working session on the raise story and the data from your pilots.

We can tighten how you talk through the numbers, line up the key narrative for investors, and map out the likely hard questions so you feel ready walking into those meetings.

No pressure on anything formal right now, I am just happy to help you get prepared and we can see from there if it makes sense to keep working together.

What day in that window could work for you?

hi Mikaela - how did you go with the pitch?

### Mikaela Greene (4:21 PM) - INBOUND
Hi Sachee,

I'm so sorry for the delay in response, the pitch went well. I worked very hard to really refine our data and focus on the main value our app provides the hospitality industry. They were very impressed with the data I had and the gap in the market that MyTab fills. The main issue was identifying an accurate customer acquisition cost, so I am currently reviewing the best way forward to verify our CAC for the new year.

That sounds great, I have another pitch on the 5th of December so would be great to maybe try to catch up on the 4th if you have any availability? I am available any time after 12:00pm as I have a few meetings in the morning.

Please let me know if that works for you.

Kindest,

Mikaela

unfortunately I don't have any availability on the 4th, but I'm happy to do potentially the 2nd or 3rd over zoom to do a sense check on the numbers.

do you have a pitch deck prepped? If you send prior i can give feedback or just shoot it off to a few contacts

---

### Mikaela Greene (4:56 PM) - INBOUND
The 2nd would work perfectly for me, I'm happy to work around your availability.

I do have a pitch deck, do you have an email address I can forward it to?

### Sachee Perera (5:03 PM) - OUTBOUND
