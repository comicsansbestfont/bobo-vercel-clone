## 2. Deep Research

### 2.1 Company Background

**Origin Story:**
- Founded by Nathan Aranha and David Cain (childhood friends, co-founded Altsreport crypto education platform together - sold to Cointelegraph 2018)
- Started after crypto exit - wanted to solve "the biggest problem for the next generation" → home ownership
- Initially started as a Propco/Opco model (~$10M funding for property purchases + charity)
- Pivoted when interest rates rose - shifted focus to asset-light loyalty platform (OpCo)
- Recently (late 2024) brought on Amy Sheen Ash as co-founder - former Chief Data Officer at NAB and Tabcorp, Global Head of Data & Analytics at HSBC

**Corporate Entity:**
- IAMXO Pty Ltd (Australia)
- Linked entity: Iamxo Technologies LLP (Bangalore, India - offshore dev team)

**Comparable:**
- US: Built Rewards (founded 2021, scaled to $10.7B valuation, 300M raise from Blackstone, MasterCard, Wells Fargo)

### 2.2 Market & Industry

**Market Context - The "Deposit Gap":**
- Sydney: 6 years 8 months for couple to save 20% deposit
- Melbourne: ~5 years 5 months
- Rental costs: ~39% of income in major capitals (creates "rental entrapment")
- Barrier shifted from mortgage serviceability → capital accumulation

**Industry:** PropTech / FinTech / Loyalty
- Specifically: "Rent Tech" meets "Deposit Helper" space
- Riding Build-to-Rent (BTR) wave in Australia

**Geographic Focus:**
- Australia (current)
- International expansion planned: UAE, India, other markets
- Banking partnerships being explored in multiple countries

### 2.3 Product/Service

**Core Product: Occubuy Mobile App**
- Tokenizes rental payments via "Occupoints" closed-loop reward system
- Users earn points by tracking rent payments (400 points for connecting rent account)
- "Rent Streak" feature rewards 3, 6, 12-month payment consistency
- Average member earns ~$10,000 worth of points over 2 years
- Redemption: 25-50 cents per point (variable, capped at seller discretion)

**Secondary Features:**
- "Buyer Readiness Quiz" (150 points) - financial data harvesting/lead qualification
- Credit score management (Experian integration)
- Debt consolidation guidance
- Utility bill savings (electricity, gas)
- Open banking integration (~3,000 connected users)
- Mortgage equivalency calculator (shows what rent would afford in mortgage)

**Upcoming (Next 6 months):**
- December 2025: V1 refresh launch + marketing push
- April 2025: V2.0 with gamification, hyper-personalization, social engagement, communities, savings goal collaboration

**Key Hire:**
- First design hire from Up Bank (Dom Pym's fintech) - leading UX/design refresh

### 2.4 Business Model

**Two-Sided Marketplace:**
- B2C: Renters (free to use)
- B2B: Partner network (pays referral fees/commissions)

**Revenue Streams:**

| Stream | % Revenue | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Financial Products | ~60% | Super fund switching, debt consolidation, personal loans, mortgages (50/50 splits with partners) |
| Property Purchases | ~40% | Developer rebates + commissions when user buys property |

**Partner Model:**
- "Alliance" of 25 partners across categories
- 50/50 revenue splits on most referral fees
- Not "lead selling" like Finder - nurturing leads over 18-36 months
- Moving to on-balance sheet model (Qantas-style: fund rewards, deferred liability, 50-60% margin target)

**Key Partners:**
- LoanOptions.ai (mortgages)
- Experian (credit bureau)
- FrontYa (shared equity - coopetition)
- Blossom (savings)
- Superwise, Movinghub (utilities/relocation)
- Property: Mirvac, Meriton, ~8 property development partners

### 2.5 Growth Signals

**Traction:**
- 15,000 app users
- ~3,000 connected to open banking
- 50-100 organic signups/week (no marketing spend)
- 20 million views/month across socials
- Revenue positive / cash flow positive (bootstrapped)

**Recent Developments:**
- Amy Sheen Ash joined as co-founder (signed contracts Dec 2025)
  - Former CDO NAB, CDO Tabcorp, Global Head Data & Analytics HSBC
  - Building AI/ML products for banks since 2014-2015
  - Access to NAB, HSBC for partnerships
- Up Bank's first designer onboarded
- Working with Australia's biggest loyalty consultant (advises Velocity, Qantas)
- Interest from Indian Overseas Bank, UAE banks
- Mirvac, Meriton piloting discussions

**Funding Status:**
- Bootstrapped to date
- Seeking: $1-2M at $12M valuation cap (SAFE note)
- Planning: Series A mid-late 2025 targeting $20-25M valuation
- Interest from: Dom Pym/Frank's Triple Bubble, family/friends, design studio (sweat equity)

### 2.6 Key Stakeholders

| Person | Role | Background |
|--------|------|------------|
| **Nathan Aranha** | Co-founder (commercial, public-facing) | Crypto (Altsreport exit to Cointelegraph 2018), HNW sales, SAF community member, Bangalore Catholic background |
| **David Cain** | Co-founder (ops/product) | Childhood friend of Nathan, co-founded Altsreport |
| **Amy Sheen Ash** | Co-founder (data, enterprise) | CDO NAB, CDO Tabcorp, Global Head Data & Analytics HSBC, Chinese background, no kids, "chip on shoulder" |

### 2.7 Competitive Landscape

**Direct "Deposit Helper" Competitors:**

| Competitor | Model | Differentiation |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| **FrontYa** | Shared equity (doubles deposit for 25% of gains) | Fast but expensive in equity; Occubuy partners with them |
| **Coposit** | Off-the-plan ($10K deposit + installments) | Specific to new builds; developer pays fees |
| **OwnHome** | Rent-to-own (buys property, user rents back) | Capital intensive; more certainty of ownership |

**Indirect "Rent Tech" Competitors:**

| Competitor | Focus | Threat Level |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| **Snug** | Rental applications (1.5M renters, 73K property managers) | HIGH - owns top of funnel, could add rewards |
| **Managed App** | Property management payments | MEDIUM - controls payment rail |

**Occubuy's Position:**
- Asset-light vs heavy capital competitors
- "Coopetition" with FrontYa (monetize users at different stages)
- Pre-qualification funnel play (nurture → convert)

### 2.8 TLDR

- **The Play:** Tokenizing "dead money" rent payments into points redeemable toward home deposits - behavioral modification + loyalty platform for aspiring homeowners
- **The Team:** Nathan Aranha (commercial/crypto background), David Cain (ops), + recent C-suite hire Amy Sheen Ash (ex-CDO NAB/Tabcorp, ex-HSBC Global Data Head) - exceptional team upgrade
- **The Traction:** 15K users, revenue positive, 25 partners, 50-100 organic signups/week with zero marketing
- **The Pivot:** From capital-heavy Propco to asset-light loyalty SaaS - now targeting bank partnerships and BTR developers
- **The Ask:** $1-2M at $12M cap, Series A targeting $20-25M mid-2025
- **The Comp:** Built Rewards (US) - $10.7B valuation - similar model

## 3. GTM Assessment

### Current State

**Sales Motion:**
- Direct-to-consumer acquisition (no partner distribution yet)
- Zero marketing spend - organic growth via word of mouth and social
- 20M views/month on social driving awareness
- No paid acquisition, no referral program pushed yet

**Enterprise Motion (emerging):**
- Working with top AU loyalty consultant (Velocity/Qantas advisor)
- Pilot conversations with Mirvac, Meriton
- Amy Sheen Ash opening doors to NAB, HSBC
- Interest from UAE, Indian banks (Indian Overseas Bank)

### What's Working

- **Product-market fit signal:** Users signing up organically (50-100/week) with no marketing
- **Revenue positive:** Not burning cash, sustainable growth
- **Partner ecosystem:** 25 partners, 50/50 splits, diversified revenue
- **Team upgrade:** Amy Sheen Ash brings enterprise access + data expertise
- **Social traction:** 20M views/month builds awareness
- **Coopetition model:** FrontYa partnership monetizes users at different funnel stages

### What's Broken / Pain Points

1. **Enterprise sales velocity:** Pilot discussions drag, no leverage with banks yet
   - *Nathan's words:* "We're being looked at as a great option with no leverage, no negotiating power"
   - Need to nail 1-2 AU bank deals before international expansion

2. **Long tail revenue model:** 18-36 month lead cycles mean delayed cash conversion
   - Why they're pushing interim revenue (utilities, super, debt consolidation)

3. **SEO/discoverability:** Horrible SEO, website not ranking
   - Holding back organic growth potential

4. **Product completeness:** Current app is MVP, holding back marketing
   - V2.0 with gamification not until April 2025

5. **Trust perception:** Reddit skepticism about "data harvesting" and walled garden redemption
   - Need transparency on business model

6. **Fundraising reluctance:** Nathan personally doesn't want to focus on raising
   - *Nathan's words:* "I can't be bothered with the capital raising component... I'm enjoying building"

### Immediate Goals (Next 90 days)

1. December 2025: App refresh launch + marketing push
2. Onboard 1-2 bank partnerships in Australia (via Amy's NAB/HSBC connections)
3. Close pilot agreements with BTR developers (Mirvac, Meriton)
4. Raise $1-2M SAFE at $12M cap

### Strategic Goals (12 months)

1. April 2025: V2.0 launch with gamification, communities, social features
2. Series A at $20-25M valuation mid-2025
3. International expansion (UAE, India) with bank partnerships
4. Scale enterprise "Partner Loyalty" SaaS for BTR developers

## 4. Meeting Notes

*Extracted from /Meetings folder. Add new meetings at top.*

### 2025-11-19 - Discovery Call (First Meeting)
**Attendees:** Nathan Aranha, Sachee Perera
**Duration:** 42:51

**Key Discussion:**

**Origin Story & Pivot:**
- Started with crypto (Altsreport) - exited to Cointelegraph 2018
- Built 50K subscriber base, decided crypto was getting "dirty" with pump-and-dumps
- Pivoted to property - started Propco/Opco with ~$10M funding
- Interest rates killed capital-heavy model - shifted to asset-light loyalty platform
- Discovered Built Rewards (US) as validation - $10.7B valuation

**Recent Team Addition:**
- Amy Sheen Ash (former CDO NAB, CDO Tabcorp, Global Head Data HSBC) just signed as co-founder
- She approached them after seeing their data - "I want to join"
- Brings enterprise bank access (NAB, HSBC lined up)
- Also hired first designer from Up Bank

**Business Model Deep Dive:**
- 60% revenue: super fund switching, debt consolidation, personal loans, mortgages
- 40% revenue: property purchase commissions
- Moving to Qantas-style on-balance sheet model (50-60% margin target)
- 50/50 splits with partners (not lead selling - nurturing)

**Traction:**
- 15,000 users, 3,000 on open banking
- 50-100 signups/week (zero marketing)
- 20M views/month on socials
- Revenue positive
- 25 partners total

**Fundraising Plans:**
- Seeking $1-2M at $12M cap (SAFE)
- Interest from Dom Pym's Triple Bubble
- Planning Series A mid-late 2025 at $20-25M
- Design studio offering $250K sweat equity deal

**Biggest Blockers (in Nathan's words):**
1. Personal: "I don't want to do the whole capital raising... I'm enjoying building"
2. Business: "Access to banks... we need to nail down one or two banks here"
3. Leverage: "We're being looked at as a great option with no leverage"

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Nathan to send investment deck for feedback
- [ ] Sachee to potentially invest (expressed interest)
- [ ] Sachee offered to help with enterprise sales/partner conversion
- [ ] Nathan to share more detail on bank partnership strategy
- [ ] Connect Nathan with Michael from Friday (digital bank for solopreneurs)
- [ ] Catch up for beers when Sachee returns to Sydney (Feb)

**My Observations:**
> Nathan is a natural salesperson - enthusiastic, narrative-driven, builds rapport quickly. The Amy Sheen Ash hire is a game-changer - brings C-suite enterprise access they desperately need for bank partnerships. The reluctance to fundraise is both a strength (discipline) and weakness (limiting growth). The Built Rewards comp ($10.7B) is powerful validation but needs AU market proof. The biggest risk is the long tail revenue model and trust perception. Biggest opportunity is the bank partnership play - if they can sign 1-2 AU banks, they have real leverage for international expansion.

## 6. My Notes & Observations

### Hypotheses to Test

1. **Can they convert bank pilots to contracts?** Amy's access is great but pilots ≠ revenue
2. **Is the 18-36 month lead cycle sustainable?** Need to validate interim revenue sufficiency
3. **Will V2.0 gamification drive retention?** Current app may have engagement issues
4. **Is $12M cap reasonable?** 15K users, revenue positive, but unproven enterprise model

### Red Flags

1. **Fundraising reluctance:** Nathan's personal preference to not fundraise could limit growth at critical moment
2. **Long revenue cycles:** 18-36 months to property purchase revenue
3. **Walled garden criticism:** Reddit users skeptical of point redemption value
4. **No marketing tested:** Organic growth great, but paid acquisition unit economics unknown
5. **Dependent on partner ecosystem:** 50/50 splits mean reliant on partner quality/conversion

### Opportunities

1. **Enterprise sales coaching:** Clear pain point - pilot-to-contract conversion, negotiating leverage
2. **Go-to-market strategy:** Help define which vertical to focus (banks vs BTR vs both)
3. **Investment:** Small check ($25-50K?) in SAFE round - aligned incentives
4. **Introductions:** Michael from Friday (bank partnerships), other SAF connections
5. **Positioning/messaging:** "Dead money" narrative powerful but trust gap needs addressing

### Pattern Recognition

- **Similar to CorePlan trajectory:** Technical product, needs commercial leadership to scale
- **Crypto-to-PropTech pivot:** Interesting pattern, brings community building skills
- **The "partner network as moat" play:** See this in marketplaces - needs critical mass
- **Amy Sheen Ash hire:** Classic "hire 10 years ahead" move - could accelerate or create tension

### Strategic Insight (from Dec 2025 comms)

**The bank pitch reframe:** Stop pitching volume (leads), start pitching verification (risk reduction).

Nathan's refined 3 selling points to banks:
1. **Customer understanding:** 20-45 y/o underserved, unengaged segment
2. **Lower CAC:** Cheaper mortgage customer acquisition than traditional channels
3. **Reduced risk:** Occubuyers are statistically lower-risk borrowers (open banking data proves it)

Key question to validate: Can they prove open-banking users are statistically lower-risk borrowers? This is the leverage play.

### Personal Notes

> Really enjoyed Nathan - authentic, energetic, honest about challenges. The fact that he said "I don't want to do fundraising" shows self-awareness and integrity. Amy joining is the inflection point - if she can deliver bank partnerships, this could scale fast. The Built Rewards comp is compelling if the AU market can support similar economics. I'm genuinely interested both as advisor and investor. Need to see the deck and understand the cap table before committing.
