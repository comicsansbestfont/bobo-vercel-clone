## LinkedIn Exchange (Nov 20, 2025)

### Nathan Aranha (6:41 AM)
> Hey mate, appreciate the time yesterday. Was great getting to know you and our chat definitely sparked some ideas!!
>
> Here's my number if you're on WhatsApp: +61477666671
>
> Let's chat there in the meantime, I can share stuff there or via your email. LFG 🚀

### Sachee Perera (3:11 PM)
> Hey Nathan, awesome connecting!
>
> Loved our chat.. seriously impressive work pivoting to the asset-light model and locking in Amy as a co-founder—that's a massive coup for the next phase. and the traction you've got with zero marketing spend is a testament to how much the "dead money" narrative resonates with this generation.
>
> I put LFG on all our recruitment ads and make it an official value - and candidates went wild haha
>
> During my walk this morning i was thinking about our chat and the "leverage" issue with banks. It hit me that you might be, and correct me if i'm wrong, pitching volume (leads), when the real asset is verification (risk reduction).
>
> Can you prove those open-banking users are statistically lower-risk borrowers to them? (or is it that they want to see more volume you think?)
>
> Happy to unpack this whenever!
>
> My number is +61413572387
>
> Chat soon! 🚀

## WhatsApp Exchange (Nov 21 & Oct 23, 2025)

### Nathan Aranha (Nov 21, 8:48 AM)
> hey man, its sachee!
>
> I signed up to your app and took this quiz around. I just shared the link with a couple of people, and I totally get now the push for banks because the #1 question that I'm getting asked by everyone (sample size of 5 haha) is which banks support the points.

### Sachee Perera (Nov 21, 11:45 AM)
> That's awesome! Thanks man, a little embarrassing as the updates coming soon are a lot better. Don't want to ask what you think hahaha
>
> The points are currently funded by partners. Still transactional, however the banks, insurers and employers pose an opportunity as points buyers. Similar to how Qantas sells points for customer acquisition/retention. We have a few ways to structure the deal so can discuss the best fit for partners at different tiers.
>
> I think it would be cool to layout the opportunities available to us in the next 12 months, working together to refine and target the lowest hanging fruit/fastest path to adoption.

### Sachee's LinkedIn Message Context (shared in WhatsApp):
> Re your Linkedin message:
>
> 3 things we are selling to banks in particular
>
> 1- Understanding of the 20-45 yo customer that is underserved and unengaged
>
> 2- Lower cost of acquisition for mortgage customers
>
> 3- Reduced risk when lending to Occubuyers. (Takes time to prove, however Amy has built the credit decision models for banks, which speeds up our time to market with this value prop)

### Nathan Aranha (Oct 23, time unclear)
> sorry I thought I replied - I was balls deep in front of 3 screens trying to get a project live - im trying to solve my "I have docs, notes and context everywhere" problem.
>
> no no, nothing to be embarrassed about - what works works! what works for your initial user base so right now thats what matters.
>
> thats interesting. think definite education piece for the banks. I think so many levers to pull but need to get more context to know which ones are critical vs which ones give 10x return.
>
> yeah im interested seeing how or if I can provide help.
>
> next time you feel like you need a sounding board why dont you shoot me a msg
