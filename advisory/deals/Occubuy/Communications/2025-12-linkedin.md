Nathan Aranha: Hey mate, appreciate the time yesterday. Was great getting to know you and our chat definitely sparked some ideas!! Here's my number if you're on WhatsApp +61477666671 Let's chat there in the meantime, I can share stuff there or via your email. LFG
Sachee Perera: Hey Nathan, awesome connecting! Loved our chat.. seriously impressive work pivoting to the asset-light model and locking in Amy as a co-founder-that's a massive coup for the next phase. and the traction you've got with zero marketing spend is a testament to how much the "dead money" narrative resonates with this generation. I put LFG on all our recruitment ads and make it an official value - and candidates went wild haha. During my walk this morning i was thinking about our chat and the "leverage" issue with banks. It hit me that you might be, and correct me if i'm wrong, pitching volume (leads), when the real asset is verification (risk reduction). Can you prove those open-banking users are statistically lower-risk borrowers to them? (or is it that they want to see more volume you think?) Happy to unpack this whenever! My number is +61413572387
