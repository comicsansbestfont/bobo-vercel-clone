## Extracted Content

"I signed up to your app and took this quiz around. I just shared the link with a couple of people, and I totally get now the push for banks because the #1 question that I'm getting asked by everyone (sample size of 5 haha) is which banks support the points."

"The points are currently funded by partners. Still transactional, however the banks, insurers and employers pose an opportunity as points buyers. Similar to how Qantas sells points for customer acquisition/activation. We have a few ways to structure the deal so can discuss the best fit for partners at different tiers."

"3 things we are selling to banks in particular 1- Understanding of the 20-45 y/o customer that is underserved and unengaged 2- Lower cost of acquisition for mortgage customers 3- Reduced risk when lending to Occubuyers."
