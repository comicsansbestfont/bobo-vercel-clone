  - Started a charity
  - Set up tech team in Bangalore (Opco)

## Biggest Blockers (Nathan's Words)

### 1. Personal Reluctance to Fundraise
> *"I know that capital raising is going to be important. I'm just enjoying building a business... I can't be bothered with the capital raising component. I'm enjoying working with my team, building an amazing business, working with customers, getting them close to homeownership - that's what's fueling me at the moment."*

### 2. Access to Banks
> *"From the big swing perspective, what would be the biggest blocker in us demolishing the market would be the access to banks and starting to partner and pilot with a bunch of banks."*

### 3. No Leverage in Negotiations
> *"We're sort of being looked at as a great option with no leverage, no negotiating power. I think the next six months we need to conclude on that."*

> *"If we can nail down one or two banks here, then we've got a much better leg when we go to those overseas banks because it becomes - this is what we've been able to prove, this is the commercial arrangement that we're targeting, we don't work with you, we're going to work with someone else."*

---

## Bank Value Proposition

Nathan identified two key pain points for banks that Occubuy solves:

1. **Customer understanding:** Banks don't understand 20-45 y/o "new to bank, new to credit" customers well enough
2. **High acquisition costs:** Current channels (brokers + trailing commissions) blow their budgeting

Occubuy can send customers directly to bank at much lower cost than traditional channels.

---

## Go-to-Market Strategy

**Current state:** Direct-to-consumer acquisition only
- Want to own the customer journey first
- Control experience before opening to partner distribution
- Nathan: *"Don't let anyone help us acquire these customers. We want to own that customer and help them first."*

**Future state (international):**
- White-label for banks
- Plug-and-play distribution partnerships
- Interest from UAE, India, other markets

---

## Comparable: Built Rewards (US)

- Founded 2021
- $60M initial funding from Blackstone, MasterCard, Wells Fargo
- Scaled to **$10.7 billion valuation** in 4 years
- Most recent raise: $300M on $10.7B val
- Similar problem: giving value back to renters for "dead money"
- Started with home ownership focus (like Occubuy)

## Quotes Worth Noting

On why they pivoted from crypto:
> *"We could have easily stayed there. I probably would have been a lot wealthier if I'd stuck to it, but it was just something that we just didn't like the vibe of."*

On bootstrapped discipline:
> *"We've made so many mistakes on our own dime. We feel like if we do raise money now, we know how to spend the money."*

On Amy joining:
> *"She was so excited by what we were gathering that she was like, I want to join. And we're like, what do you mean? She's like, well I'm going to leave Tabcorp, set up a place for me in this company and I'm going to join as a co-founder."*

On knowing they're onto something:
> *"We know we're onto something, we just can't exactly put our finger on it yet. But we know we're onto something good."*

On the "dead money" angle:
> Sachee: *"I love the dead money angle. It's kind of provocative. It gets you in the parts that hurt you the most."*

## My Observations

> **Nathan is a natural salesperson** - enthusiastic, narrative-driven, builds rapport quickly. Very likeable. The crypto background gave him community-building skills that translate well.

> **The Amy Sheen Ash hire is a game-changer.** C-suite enterprise access they desperately need for bank partnerships. If she can deliver NAB/HSBC, this could accelerate fast.

> **Bootstrapped discipline is a strength.** They haven't wasted capital on offices or premature scaling. They know what moves the needle.

> **The reluctance to fundraise is both strength and weakness.** Shows integrity and focus on building, but could limit growth at critical moment. Nathan's self-awareness about this is encouraging.

> **Built Rewards comp ($10.7B) is powerful validation** but needs AU market proof. The "dead money" narrative resonates emotionally.

> **Biggest risk:** Long-tail revenue model (18-36 months to property purchase). Trust perception issues also surfacing (Sachee mentioned Perth failed attempt, data harvesting concerns).

> **Biggest opportunity:** Bank partnership play. If they can sign 1-2 AU banks, they have real leverage for international expansion. Amy's access is the key.

> **Personal interest:** Genuinely interested both as advisor and investor. Need to see the deck and understand cap table before committing.
