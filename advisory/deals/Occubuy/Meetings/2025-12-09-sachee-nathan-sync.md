## Key Updates from Nathan

### Melbourne Executive Network (NEW)
- Found high-profile Melbourne-based executives wanting to champion Occubuy
- Board positions on large Australian companies
- **Dual-angle strategy:** Partners push from partnership side + executives pressure from board level
- Same group looking to **syndicate $1M** in funding
- Nathan met in Melbourne yesterday to discuss commercial arrangements
- Nathan: *"That's almost the unlock in Australia - just getting access from the board level"*

### Traction Update (MAJOR)
- **ARR: ~$1.2M** (just under $100K/month) - significant increase from prior "revenue positive" disclosure
- This enables ARR multiple valuation methods (not just Berkus)

### US Expansion Progress
- Advisor from **Douglas Elliman** (first investor in Built Rewards, former Chief Investment Officer)
- Has "taken it all on himself" to help set up US operations
- **Achievements in last 6 months:**
  - Open banking access in every state
  - Real estate license obtained
  - Partnership infrastructure set up
- Big opportunity to establish US brand presence in next 6 months

### Investor Conversations
- **Dom Pym meeting:** ~2 weeks ago in Melbourne
  - *"Interesting conversations... he's a character"*
  - Potential money next year, not holding breath
- **Camber Creek** (Built Rewards investor):
  - Open to acquisition discussions if Occubuy attacks foreign markets (UAE, India)
  - Nathan: *"Definitely not in Built's short-term roadmap"*
  - Potential exit strategy alignment

### Amy Sheen Ash Impact
- **Tripled conversion rate** with hyper-personalization (light touch changes)
- Mapped entire customer journey with key moments
- Push notification strategy based on Tabcorp experience
- Managing 5 interns, "killing it"
- **Found via Gemini Deep Research** - ranked #1 for their data needs
- Cold outreach → advisory conversation → she had just left Tabcorp → co-founder offer accepted
- **Press release Thursday** announcing Amy joining

### Strategic Levers Document
- Nathan created strategic levers mapping after Sachee's "what are the triggers/levers" prompt
- Has been valuable for team alignment
- Updated since last version - wants to share with Sachee

## Capital Raise Strategy Discussion

### Nathan's Ask
- Wants to go through capital raise strategy for next 12-24 months
- Get feedback on valuation milestones and triggers
- Key questions:
  - What triggers enable certain valuation milestones?
  - Is it opening new markets or developing current market?
  - How to balance valuation with achievable milestones (avoid overvaluing → forced down rounds)

### Sachee's Experience Shared
- Raised $4M for CorePlan
- 2021-2022 had inflated valuations (Mr. Yum at 22x)
- CorePlan got 5.8x - felt low at time, but avoided down rounds
- Offer to get feedback from VC mates

### Strategic Partner Considerations
- Bank partnerships (NAB, others via Amy)
- Super fund partnerships
- Could significantly change value proposition (especially D2C)
- Need to map how partnerships affect valuation

### Sachee's Offers
1. Help craft capital raise strategy for next 12-24 months
2. Get external VC feedback on Occubuy pitch
3. Connect Nathan with VCs Sachee has pitched to
4. Warm intros + background feedback on why VCs did/didn't invest

## User Feedback Collected by Sachee

**One piece of feedback from this morning:**
> "Seems interesting and especially in this economy. I got the setup page, but was thinking about it as I have to connect my bank and wasn't sure on the safety of data and the account. That's what holds me back."

**Nathan's response:**
- Just updated website and app
- Leaned into "more secure" look rather than "impulse" version
- Impulse version was working better for conversion
- **Biggest pain point:** Getting people connected to open banking, removing uncertainty

## Built Rewards Comparable

Nathan shared Built context:
- $10 billion valuation with 5 million users
- Achieved in 4 years
- Camber Creek (portfolio investor) - Built has "basically carried their portfolio"

## My Observations

> **The acceleration is real.** In 2-3 weeks Nathan has: (1) landed Melbourne exec network willing to syndicate $1M, (2) progressed US setup significantly, (3) had Dom Pym and Camber Creek conversations. The Amy hire continues to pay dividends - tripled conversion is significant.

> **Key insight from Nathan:** *"One of your messages - 'what are the triggers, the big swing levers' - I went through and did a whole mapping on strategic levers. Even just a couple of words gave me a lot of momentum and value."* This is proof of advisory value landing.

> **The bank/open banking trust issue** keeps surfacing. Multiple users independently citing data safety concerns. This is their biggest conversion blocker - worth exploring solutions.

> **Camber Creek acquisition interest** is notable - signals exit optionality if they can crack UAE/India markets. Strategic value beyond just the raise.

> **Nathan's energy:** Still infectious, but more focused. The exec network and Amy seem to have given him confidence and direction. The reluctance to fundraise may be shifting now that leverage is building.

## Quotes Worth Noting

On the Melbourne exec network:
> *"Some really pretty high profile guys sitting on executive boards of large companies in Australia. Definitely helps with positioning as a partner."*

On Amy's impact:
> *"Just in the last month, testing with users... we've tripled our conversion rate into products and services. And that's with very light touch changes."*

On valuation philosophy:
> *"Maintenance for us is not overvaluing ourselves then having to chase milestones. Make them easy to hit though, in the same sense."*

On Sachee's prompt impact:
> *"What are the triggers, the big swing levers - I went through and did a whole mapping. Even just a couple of words gave me a lot of momentum and value."*

On finding Amy:
> *"We did a deep research on Gemini - plugged in what our business does, the data we're gathering, our objective - best people in Australia that can support us. Her name was number one."*
