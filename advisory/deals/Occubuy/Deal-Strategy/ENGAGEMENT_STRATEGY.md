# Occubuy Engagement Strategy

**Created:** 2025-12-09
**Status:** Decision Made - Pending Execution
**Next Action:** Dec 15-16 call with Nathan
**Decision Makers:** Sachee Perera (with input from Claude + Gemini)

---

## Executive Summary

After deep analysis of the Occubuy deal, relationship dynamics, and Sachee's angel investment strategy, the recommended engagement structure is a **"Sweat + Cheque Hybrid"**:

- **$5K cash** investment (learning cheque)
- **$10K services** (3-week Capital Raise Sprint, credited to SAFE)
- **$15K total equity** at $12M cap (~0.125%)

This structure aligns incentives, preserves Nathan's cash flow, and critically - **uses the sprint as due diligence** to validate the business before committing capital.

## Part 2: Relationship Analysis

### Timeline with Nathan

| Date | Interaction | Value Exchange |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Nov 13 | LinkedIn connection | Initial contact via SAF community |
| Nov 19 | 43-min discovery call | Nathan shared full business model, challenges |
| Nov 20-21 | WhatsApp/LinkedIn | **Sachee gave free advice:** reframe bank pitch from "volume" to "risk reduction" |
| Dec 8 | WhatsApp | **Sachee tested app**, shared user feedback on trust concerns |
| Dec 9 | 24-min strategy sync | Major updates: ARR confirmed, Melbourne network, US progress |
| Dec 15-16 | Scheduled | Capital raise strategy discussion |

### Signals Nathan Is Sending

**1. He values strategic input over capital:**
> "What are the triggers, the big swing levers - I went through and did a whole mapping. Even just a couple of words gave me a lot of momentum and value."

Nathan created an internal strategic document based on Sachee's prompt. This is proof of advisory value landing.

**2. He invites Sachee into problems (without asking directly):**
- "would be great to sound a few ideas with you"
- "working together to refine and target"
- "I think it would be cool to layout the opportunities"

He's deferring to Sachee to define the engagement structure.

**3. He hasn't pushed the investment deck:**
Despite Sachee expressing investment interest, Nathan prioritizes strategy discussions. The capital isn't what he needs from Sachee.

**4. He doesn't need small cheques:**
Melbourne exec network is syndicating $1M. A $5-10K cheque is a rounding error for capital purposes - but meaningful as alignment signal.

### The Core Dynamic

Nathan perceives Sachee as a **high-value intellectual asset** but sees his capital as negligible compared to the syndicate. Nathan is "reluctant to raise" and views fundraising as a distraction from building.

**Sachee's leverage:** He can remove the "pain" of the fundraising narrative/strategy while validating the business for himself.

---

## Part 3: The Strategic Dilemma

### Sachee's Concerns

1. **Due diligence needed:** Is the $1.2M ARR real? Is $12M cap defensible? What's the actual cap table?

2. **Angel strategy misalignment:** Sachee's strategy is designed for founders who need capital. Nathan doesn't need a $2.5-10K cheque.

3. **Already giving free value:** Strategic advice is landing (strategic levers document proves it). Continuing this pattern undervalues Sachee's contribution.

4. **Wants relationship-first framing:** Nathan is relationship-oriented. Can't come across as transactional.

### Options Considered

| Option | Structure | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-----------|------|------|
| A: Paid Sprint | $5-8K cash fee for 3-week sprint | Clear value exchange | Mixed signals (vendor + investor) |
| B: Sprint + Equity | Convert $10K fee to SAFE | Aligned incentives, no cash from Nathan | Betting on terms holding |
| C: Investment + Advisory | $5-10K cheque + reduced retainer | Ongoing relationship | Complex, Nathan paying cash |
| D: Small Cheque Only | $2.5-5K learning cheque | Simple, low commitment | Undervalues strategic contribution |

---

## Part 4: The Decision

### Recommended Structure: "Sweat + Cheque Hybrid"

**Do not ask for a cash fee.** Asking for $5K consulting while trying to invest sends mixed signals - "I want to be a partner, but I also need to pay my rent."

Instead: **Capital + Services for Equity**

| Component | Value | Mechanism |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Cash Investment | $5,000 AUD | Learning cheque into SAFE |
| Services (Sprint) | $10,000 AUD | Credited to SAFE (sweat equity) |
| **Total Equity** | **$15,000 AUD** | At $12M cap = ~0.125% |

### Why This Structure Wins

**For Nathan:**
- Gets "sounding board" and GTM help without burning cash
- Gets committed investor who adds strategic value
- Raise closes faster with tighter narrative

**For Sachee:**
- $15K equity for $5K cash + 3 weeks work (3x leverage)
- **The sprint IS the due diligence** - if numbers are fake, discovers it while working on deck
- Can withdraw cash offer before wire if red flags emerge
- Work he enjoys doing anyway
- Fully aligned - wins when Nathan wins

### The Safety Valve

**Critical insight:** The sprint structure lets Sachee validate before committing capital.

- Week 1-2: Deep dive (deck, numbers, narrative) - **validation happens here**
- Week 3: VC targeting, intros

If the $1.2M ARR is smoke and mirrors, Sachee discovers it during deck prep and can gracefully exit before wiring the $5K.

## Part 5: Due Diligence Framework

### Priority Questions (Framed as "Deck Prep")

**1. Revenue Quality (The $1.2M ARR Claim)**

*The Risk:* Is this actual SaaS recurring revenue, or annualized transactional revenue (commissions)?

*The Ask:*
> "Nathan, for the deck, I need to break down the $100k/MRR. How much is 'Occupoints' subscription vs. 'Referral/Commission' fees? Investors will value these differently."

*Red Flag:* If 90%+ is lumpy commissions from property sales, it's not ARR, and $12M cap is expensive.

**2. The Amy Factor**

*The Risk:* Is she a "co-founder" on paper who is actually just an advisor working 2 hours/week?

*The Ask:*
> "With Amy joining, how are you splitting the equity pool? I want to highlight the strength of the founding team in the deck."

*Validation:* If she has significant vested interest and is full-time, $12M cap is defensible on talent density alone.

**3. The Melbourne Exec Syndicate**

*The Risk:* Is this "committed" money or "soft circled" interest?

*The Ask:*
> "Who is leading the terms on the syndicate? I want to make sure my SAFE aligns with theirs."

*Red Flag:* If no lead investor and terms aren't set, the $1M may not materialize.

**4. Cap Table**

*The Ask:*
> "Can you share the current cap table? I need to understand the ownership structure for the deck narrative."

*Red Flag:* If Nathan resists sharing or it's messy from Propco days, potential issues.

### Red Flags to Watch During Sprint

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| Revenue is mostly one-off commissions | $12M cap is way too high |
| Amy is part-time / advisory only | Team strength overstated |
| Melbourne syndicate is "interested" not committed | $1M may not materialize |
| Nathan resists sharing cap table | Something to hide |
| Numbers keep shifting when you dig | Playing loose with truth |
| No clear path to bank partnerships | Amy's value prop unproven |

### Validation Targets

| Metric | Claimed | Need to Validate |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| MRR | ~$100K | Revenue breakdown by type |
| ARR Quality | Recurring | % subscription vs commission |
| Amy Commitment | Co-founder | Full-time? Equity vested? |
| Syndicate | $1M | Lead? Terms set? Committed? |
| User Growth | 50-100/week | Cohort data, retention |
| Conversion | 3x improvement | Before/after metrics |

---

## Part 6: Conversation Script

### For Dec 15-16 Call

> "Nathan, I've been thinking about how to actually be useful here - not just a sounding board on WhatsApp.
>
> I want to back you. Not because you need my money - clearly the Melbourne syndicate has that covered. But because I want skin in the game when I'm helping you.
>
> Here's what I'm thinking:
>
> I'll put in **$5K cash** alongside your other investors. Small cheque, but it's real commitment.
>
> On top of that, I want to run a proper **3-week sprint** with you - deck, narrative, valuation logic, VC targeting. The works. I'd normally charge $10K for that, but instead of cash, I'd credit it into the SAFE as well.
>
> So $15K total into the round - $5K cash, $10K in sweat. We're fully aligned. I win when you win.
>
> To do this properly, I'll need to dig into the numbers - revenue breakdown, cap table, the syndicate terms. But that's all stuff we'd cover in the sprint anyway.
>
> Does that feel like the right way to work together?"

### If Nathan Pushes Back

**On the equity-for-services:**
> "Look, I don't want to be a vendor charging you cash while also trying to invest. That's weird. This way we're fully aligned - I'm betting on the outcome, same as you."

**On the due diligence asks:**
> "These are all things investors will ask anyway. Better we nail the answers now than get caught flat-footed in a meeting."

**If he wants to keep it informal:**
> "I hear you. But here's my concern - I'm already giving you ideas you're running with. I want to make sure I'm giving you my best thinking, not just off-the-cuff stuff. A bit of structure helps me prioritize this properly."

---

## Part 8: Decision Logic

### Why This Fits Sachee's Angel Strategy

From Sachee's Angel Investment Strategy doc:

**Learning Cheques:** $2,500 - $5,000 for first 5-8 investments to calibrate judgment. The $5K cash component fits this.

**Operator-Advisor-Investor Model:** This deal fits the model where "advisory relationship drives deal access" and "investment is alignment mechanism, not capital need."

**Unfair Advantage:** Sachee has direct experience building GTM engines in vertical SaaS. Occubuy needs exactly this for enterprise sales motion.

### Why the Structure Works

| Sachee's Concern | How Structure Addresses It |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Need due diligence | Sprint IS the due diligence |
| Nathan doesn't need money | Money is alignment, not the point |
| Already giving free value | Now formalized with equity compensation |
| Want relationship-first | "I win when you win" framing |
| Angel strategy misalignment | Operator-Advisor-Investor model fits |

---

## Part 9: Risk Assessment

### Risks to Sachee

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| ARR is overstated | Medium | Discover during sprint Week 1; withdraw before wiring |
| $12M cap is too high | Medium | Negotiate or walk if DD reveals issues |
| Sprint work is wasted | Low | Work is enjoyable; learning value regardless |
| Nathan ghosts after sprint | Low | Cash not wired until sprint validates |
| Amy leaves | Low | Part of DD - validate her commitment |

### Exit Ramps

1. **End of Week 1:** If revenue breakdown reveals ARR is fake, exit gracefully
2. **Before wire:** Can withdraw cash commitment at any point before transfer
3. **Terms mismatch:** If syndicate terms differ significantly, renegotiate or exit

## Appendix A: Full Relationship Context

### Discovery Call Highlights (Nov 19, 2025)

**Nathan's Self-Identified Blockers:**
1. "I don't want to do the whole capital raising... I'm enjoying building"
2. "We're being looked at as a great option with no leverage, no negotiating power"
3. "Access to banks... we need to nail down one or two banks here"

**Key Quote:**
> "I can't be bothered with the capital raising component... I'm enjoying building"

This confirms fundraising is a pain point Sachee can solve.

### Strategy Sync Highlights (Dec 9, 2025)

**Major Updates:**
- ARR confirmed: ~$1.2M (~$100K/month)
- Melbourne exec network syndicating $1M
- US expansion progress via Douglas Elliman advisor
- Amy tripled conversion rate in first month
- Camber Creek (Built investor) interested in acquisition if UAE/India expansion
- Dom Pym meeting happened, potential money next year

**Key Quote (on Sachee's value):**
> "One of your messages - 'what are the triggers, the big swing levers' - I went through and did a whole mapping on strategic levers. Even just a couple of words gave me a lot of momentum and value."

This proves advisory value is landing.

### Communication Pattern

Nathan consistently:
- Invites Sachee into problems without directly asking for help
- Values strategic input over capital
- Responds enthusiastically to frameworks and prompts
- Shares openly about challenges and opportunities
