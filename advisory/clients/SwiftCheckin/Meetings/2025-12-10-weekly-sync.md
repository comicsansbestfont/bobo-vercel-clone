## Summary

Weekly sync covering SwiftCheckin's sales progress, product development (Flutter app for geofencing), Ariel trial status, VC conversations, and discussion about the future of Sachee's advisory engagement which is wrapping up at end of December.

## Key Points

### Sales & Lead Generation
- Finished the 150 lead outreach; struggling with lead regeneration
- **Decision made to not continue with Kavita** - Nisha to focus fully on sales
- Created lead list for roofing and HVAC contractors (120 companies)
- Using Apollo and Lusha to clean and verify lead lists
- Got 6 interested companies from Nisha and Kavita's conversations - struggling to convert to demos
- Need to create personalized videos for the 6 prospects this week

### Inbound Marketing
- Spent $35 on Facebook ads, got 1 inbound lead
- Lead is from Gold Coast - telecommunications trade business (CCTV/cable installers in construction)
- May be a senior technician with a small company (~5 employees) or from larger company (Midwe Communications)
- **Facebook performing better than LinkedIn** - considering shifting organic efforts to Facebook

### Ariel Trial Status
- Trial ends December 20th (Ariel finishing for Christmas on 19th)
- Processing 450-600 hours per week through platform
- **Primary value:** Subcontractor verification and labor cost visibility (not overtime)
- Only 4 out of 17-20 crew members are employees needing overtime calculations
- Ariel requesting auto geofence check-in/check-out (not part of original trial agreement)
- **Strategy:** Sign contract now, start billing when they restart in January

### Product Development
- **Releasing live labor cost calculation feature** - 80-90% complete, releasing today
- Built based on Ariel's Excel reference data
- Currently using flat pay rates for subcontractors, double-time multiplier for employees (EBA rules)
- No complex award calculations needed yet (only 4 employees)
- **Building Flutter app** for proper geofencing (released on Play Store yesterday, App Store coming)
- Current PWA has technical block: users have to enable location for entire browser, causing them to disable permissions

### Technical Block - Geofencing
- PWA requires browser-wide location permission (Chrome/Safari)
- Users keep disabling location access
- Native app (Flutter) only requires one-time app-specific permission
- This was identified as a blocker long ago but deprioritized until now

### Customer Testimonials
- Meeting with Damien Morrow (Teams) to discuss:
  - Annual contract (he agreed to pay for one year in December)
  - Testimonial and references (keeps postponing)
- **Sachee's advice:** Write 2 versions of testimonial based on previous conversations, ask Damien to approve/modify

### VC Conversations
- VC is interested in the labor cost calculation problem
- See it as a trending issue in the US market as well
- Happy with traction from Ariel and Damien
- **Requested from Boney:**
  1. 5-minute video demo of the system
  2. Financial modeling (customer acquisition, pricing plans)
- Have Australian partners they need to discuss with internally
- **Ask:** $1M - no objections raised
- Timeline: Boney told them closing round end of February; no pushback
- No indication yet on due diligence/valuation framework

### Lead Generation Process (Sachee explained)
- Scraped multiple directories (Yellow Pages, trade contractor directories)
- Cross-referenced with Firmable for data enrichment
- Fuzzy matched multiple sources together
- AI audit: Used Gemini/ChatGPT to verify websites line-by-line
- Sample audit: 5 per 100 rows
- Shared directories previously on Cliq

### Advisory Engagement Status
- Current informal weekly calls wrapping up end of December
- Sachee's engagements have evolved - working with multiple founders now
- **For any future engagement:** Would need equity involvement and certain milestones first
- Key requirement: Founder needs to be in sales, customer-focused
- **Next steps:** Continue discussion on Cliq; revisit in January
