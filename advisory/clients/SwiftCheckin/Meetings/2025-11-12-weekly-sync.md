**Session Type:** Sounding Board (Alumni)
**Duration:** ~30-35 minutes
**Attendees:** Sachee Perera, Boney Mylady

## Focus
Marketing strategy, fundraising progress, sales pipeline review, Facebook ads optimization

## Key Discussion Points

1. **Marketing Reactivation**
   - Facebook ads reactivated for 10-11 days
   - Boney taking over marketing from Jayadev
   - Working directly with Ganesh on content for LinkedIn and Facebook

2. **Fundraising Update**
   - Contacted Melbourne Angels (both want syndicate, 60-75 day process)
   - US construction-focused VC requested pitch deck
   - Connected with 50+ construction angels across India, US, Australia
   - Initial conversations starting

3. **Sales Pipeline**
   - 4 prospects showing interest but no time for demos
   - Created Loom video (Sachee: make it more personal, less "marketing-y")
   - Nisha improving in outbound, better at discovery questions
   - Kavita struggling with effectiveness

4. **Facebook Ads Audit**
   - Only 5,000 impressions for $250 spend (very expensive)
   - Audience too narrow (320 people) - limited to NSW/Victoria
   - Targeting included "Facebook page admins" filter (removed)
   - Expanded to all of Australia during session
   - 5 leads generated: Matthew, Rahul, Ariel

5. **Video Demo Feedback**
   - Video had American voiceover, felt like an ad
   - Sachee: Personal screen recordings from Boney instead
   - More authentic, founder-to-founder communication needed

## Decisions Made

- Make demo videos personal - Boney/Nisha to record with own voice
- Expand Facebook ad audience to all of Australia
- Remove "Facebook page admins" targeting filter
- Boney to connect with prospects on LinkedIn (CEO-to-CEO)
- Consider discontinuing Kavita if no results in 2-3 weeks

## Notable Quotes

> "At this stage, you as the founder, if you put your face behind the video, it'll be way more powerful... It's not personal. It's got an American accent in it." — Sachee

> "You're not a Fortune 100 company to be sending those videos. You're a startup. Put your energy and enthusiasm in when you're doing the demo." — Sachee
