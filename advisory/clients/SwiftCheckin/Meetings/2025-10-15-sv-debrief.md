## Focus
Post-event debrief (Boney's Silicon Valley trip) and discussion about advisory engagement ending

## Key Discussion Points

1. **Silicon Valley Event Learnings**
   - Boney attended founder event in US (8:30am-10pm schedule)
   - Met OpenAI team, multiple founders with 3-4 exits
   - Discovered competitor LumberFi (raised $15M Series C) doing similar construction time tracking
   - Construction tech becoming a hot space with multiple companies entering

2. **Sales Traction Update**
   - Nisha closed her first demo (very excited)
   - Kavita close to booking a demo
   - New lead from Facebook ads (Pure Electrical company)
   - Facebook ads showing signs of working

3. **Advisory Engagement Impasse**
   - Formal engagement ends October 23, 2025
   - Sachee unable to do fractional work until Jan/Feb 2026
   - Commercial mismatch on options (equity, fractional retainer)
   - Sachee's position: Foundations set, can execute without additional advisory for first 5-10 customers

4. **Board Pressure and Funding Anxiety**
   - Board questioning value of advisory vs tangible results
   - Cash runway: ~2.5 months (through December)
   - Exploring angel round (Melbourne Angels closing mid-November)

5. **Founder-Led Sales Discussion**
   - Boney seeking clarity on what "founder-led sales" means in practice
   - Sachee: Boney must be in every customer interaction for first 10-15 customers
