## Focus
Board presentation preparation and path to 1M ARR planning

## Key Discussion Points

1. **SaaS Growth Education for Board**
   - Sachee created slide framework explaining non-linear tech growth
   - Four key stages: Problem-Solution Fit → Product-Market Fit → Go-to-Market Fit → Scale
   - SwiftCheckin currently at Problem-Solution Fit stage (need ~10 customers)
   - Explained the "trough of sorrow" pattern

2. **Sales Traction Update**
   - Kavita booked 2 demos: Apex Building (Tyson and Lindsay)
   - Nisha booked 1 strong demo
   - 3 inbound leads from Facebook ads (Rahul from StyleCrete - 22 employees, Matthew from Perth)
   - Positioning and messaging starting to work

3. **Ariel Deal Complexity**
   - Ariel (14 employees, $429/month) hesitating due to operational complexity
   - Fear of running two systems simultaneously during trial
   - Sachee: Go all-in, offer to do everything, fly to site if needed

4. **Path to ARR Milestones**
   - Current ARR: $2,700
   - To reach 100K ARR: Need ~49 more customers at $2,000 ACV
   - Revised milestone: **50K ARR with current team**
   - After 50K ARR (~25 customers): Hire AE, raise seed (~$500K)
   - 50K ARR = Product-Market Fit confirmed

5. **Strategy Shift: Find More "Damians"**
   - Target smaller contractors (0-7 employees) similar to Mr. Shingles
   - Higher volume, lower complexity, faster closes

## Decisions Made

- **Milestone Target:** 50K ARR with current team (not 100K)
- **Post-50K Strategy:** Raise seed (~$500K), hire AE, scale to 500K ARR
- **Ariel Strategy:** Go all-in, offer full migration support
- **Board Presentation:** Boney to complete using Sachee's framework

## Notable Quotes

> "Tech growth is not linear, it is unpredictable. And key milestones need to be met to scale." — Sachee

> "50K ARR. Ideally, that's the point where you do a seed round... raise about 500k and get a strong account executive." — Sachee
