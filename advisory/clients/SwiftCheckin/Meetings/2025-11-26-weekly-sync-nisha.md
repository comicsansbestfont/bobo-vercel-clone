## Focus
Ariel onboarding success, sales pipeline deep-dive, problem-solution fit validation, next milestones

## Key Discussion Points

1. **Major Customer Win - Ariel**
   - Boney spent full day in Sydney onboarding Ariel (Atlassian HQ project)
   - Started as "trial" but Ariel stopped using other systems completely
   - 28 site users onboarded (originally estimated 10-12)
   - Using for: labor cost management, contractor verification, payroll automation, timesheets
   - Ariel tried building custom Power BI solution over 2 years, gave up, now using SwiftCheckin
   - Ariel's partners (Aaron, Loriel) also onboarded
   - Message: "completely dependent on SwiftCheckin"

2. **Problem-Solution Fit Emerging**
   - Clear problem: labor cost management + contractor verification
   - Challenge: Prospects think current systems work (SimPro, ProCore, Arrow Flow)
   - Similar pattern with Mr. Shingles and Ariel

3. **Sales Pipeline Review (Nisha)**
   - 16 working days (Nov 1-25): 215 total calls
   - 75 fresh calls, 140 follow-up calls
   - 37 new connections, 55 follow-up conversations
   - 147 high-touch target accounts
   - Key prospects: RC Group (Jan follow-up), Park Defense (Jan), Marveleth, Stylecreet (not interested)

4. **Major Objections**
   - 70% using SimPro with timesheets
   - 10% using custom/ServiceM8
   - 20% using Arrow Flow
   - Real barrier: Directors too busy (tradies on-site, not at desk)

5. **Sachee's Strategic Guidance**
   - Milestone: Get 5-10 early adopters to prove problem-solution fit at scale
   - Map workflows for each customer to find repeatability
   - Relationship-driven industry - can't use "spray and pray" tactics

## Decisions Made

- **Ariel is a closed deal** - Just send contract
- Get referrals from Mr. Shingles and Ariel
- Nisha: Use "acknowledge-ignore-move on" for SimPro objections
- Establish WhatsApp/SMS channel with prospects
- Use Dec 20 - Jan downtime for lead gen expansion

## Notable Quotes

> "Bonnie, I really liked your software. The only thing I'm trying to understand is whether it's going to work as it's promising." — Ariel
