## 2. Client Context

*Carried from Deal Doc. For full research, see [deal folder](../../Deals/SwiftCheckin/).*

### Company Background
SwiftCheckin is a construction technology startup founded by Boney Mylady. The platform offers timesheet tracking, scheduling, project management, compliance, and budgeting features for construction contractors. Pre-revenue at engagement start, with strong technical capability but struggling to find product-market fit.

### Why They Engaged
- Zero revenue despite significant investment in outbound (592 cold calls, 99 DMs, 0 meetings)
- "All-in-one platform" trap - trying to do everything, doing none exceptionally well
- Needed strategic clarity: which problem to solve, for whom, and how to prove it
- Recognized need for experienced GTM guidance before burning through runway

### Success Criteria
- Pick and hyper-focus on one high-pain problem for one customer segment
- Prove willingness to pay by securing first 5+ paying customers
- Problem-centric demos replacing feature dumps
- Build only after evidence of traction

### Key Stakeholders
| Name | Role | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Boney Mylady | Founder/CEO | Primary contact, technical background |
| Nisha | Sales Lead | Outbound, demos, customer onboarding (top performer) |
| Jayadev | Marketing | Website, content, digital |
| Kavitha | SDR | Outbound calling (under review) |
| Ganesh | Content | LinkedIn, Facebook content |

*Note: Sandy (Sales Manager) exited September 2025 due to sales philosophy misalignment.*

## 7. Relationship Health

### Current Health: Yellow (Founder-Market Fit Concerns)

**Health Indicators:**
- [x] Strong relationship built (Melbourne trip, consistent engagement)
- [x] Responsive to communications
- [x] Implemented recommendations (ICP focus, demo changes)
- [ ] Seeing limited progress (1 paying customer, 1 trial pending)
- [x] Positive sentiment in calls
- [ ] Payment deferred to June 2026

### Red Flags
> **Active concerns:**
> - **Severe founder-market fit gap**: Tech founder in India selling to Australian tradies
> - **Both founders in India** with thick accents - barrier for relationship-driven sales
> - **Neither has sales experience** - learning on the job in hardest market
> - **No local presence** - events/associations not generating traction
> - **Runway critical** - December funded only
> - **Only 1 paying customer** after 5 months of engagement
> - **Ariel contract still not signed** - trial, not customer

### Opportunities
> - Strong case study potential once they convert trials to paying
> - Referral potential in construction/ConTech space
> - Re-engagement for Advisory if they raise funding

### Personal Notes
> Strong founder relationship. Boney appreciates directness and strategic thinking. Good chemistry from Melbourne trip. Mutual respect established through honest feedback on strategy.

---

## 8. Alumni Planning

### Exit Strategy
> Engagement wound down naturally - mutual agreement that execution (not more strategy) is what's needed. Offered free sounding board through January 2026 for troubleshooting, fundraising, pitch review.

### Ongoing Nurture Plan
> - Sounding board calls as-needed through Jan 2026
> - Check in Q1 2026 on trial conversion progress
> - Monitor LinkedIn for funding announcements
> - Reconnect mid-2026 if advisory support needed

### Reactivation Triggers
> - Successfully raise funding → need GTM scaling help
> - Convert trials to paying → need growth playbook
> - New challenge/pivot → need strategic refresh
> - Referral from Boney to another founder

## 9. Valuation Snapshot

*Baseline from deal doc, updated during engagement. Full analysis: `Docs/2025-12-03-valuation-analysis.md`*

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-04
**Baseline Date:** 2025-12-03 (first formal valuation)
**Framework Version:** 2.1 (AU Market Calibrated + Reality Check)

### Current Classification
| Field | Baseline | Current |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Phase** | 1a | 1a |
| **ARR** | $0 | ~$2.7K (+ trial pending) |
| **Customers** | 0 | 1 paying (+ 1 trial pending contract) |
| **Founder Engine Score** | 3.03/5.0 | 3.03/5.0 |
| **GTM Readiness** | 27.5/100 | 30/100 (improving) |

### Valuation Trajectory
| Method | Baseline | Current | Change |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| Berkus | $1.99M (raw) | $1.99M | — |
| Scorecard | $2.38M (raw) | $2.38M | — |
| **Range (Reality-Adjusted)** | $600K - $1.0M | $600K - $1.0M | — |

**Note:** Earlier documentation incorrectly stated 2 customers. Corrected Dec 5: 1 paying customer (Mr Shingles), 1 trial pending contract (Ariel).

### Key Factors
- [-] **Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty (-15%):** Tech founder selling to construction (not from industry)
- [-] **Premature Scaling Penalty (-30%):** Reduced - exited Sales Manager, now founder-led with Nisha
- [-] **GTM Readiness (-15%):** 30/100 score (improved from Chaos)
- [+] **Working Product:** Sub-1-minute onboarding, product functions well
- [+] **Two Customers Validated:** Mr Shingles (paying) + Ariel (28 users, fully migrated)
- [+] **Problem-Solution Fit Emerging:** Two distinct customer profiles validated

### Investment/Intro Status
| Decision | At Baseline | Current |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Advisory Fit | Yes (completed) | Alumni |
| Investment Fit | Not Yet | Not Yet |
| VC Intro Ready | Too Early | Too Early |

### Valuation History

| Date | Phase | ARR | Customers | FE Score | GTM | Range | Δ% | Trigger |
|------|-------|-----|-----------|----------|-----|-------|-----|---------|
| 2025-12-05 | 1a | $2.7K | 1 (+1 trial) | 3.03 | 27.5 | $600K-$1.0M | — | Corrected: Ariel is trial, not paying |
| 2025-12-03 | 1a | $2.7K | 1 | 3.03 | 27.5 | $600K-$1.0M | — | Baseline (v2.1 framework) |

**Update Triggers:**
- First 5 paying customers → re-assess
- $25K ARR milestone
- Funding round
- GTM Readiness improves to 40+

### Path to Investable Status
To reach $1.5M+ valuation and investment consideration:
1. **5+ paying customers** with similar ICP (Overtime & Overrun contractors)
2. **Founder Engine Score >= 3.5** (improve Selling Capability, Positioning)
3. **GTM Readiness >= 40** (move from Chaos to Emerging)
4. **Founder closes next 4-5 deals personally** (not through Nisha/Kavitha)
5. **Local presence established** (monthly trips, local advisor, or relocation)
