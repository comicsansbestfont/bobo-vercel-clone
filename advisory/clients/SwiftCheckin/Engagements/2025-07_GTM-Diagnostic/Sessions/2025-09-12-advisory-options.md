# Session Notes: September 12, 2025

**Session Type:** Advisory Strategy Discussion
**Duration:** ~104 minutes
**Attendees:** Sachee Perera, Boney Mylady

---

## Focus
Post-90-day engagement planning and future advisory structure options

## Key Discussion Points

1. **Engagement Review** - Started July 14, action plan began Aug 25. Boney notes it's too early to assess 90-day results but relationship working well personally.

2. **First Customer Closed** - Damien (Mr Shingles) closed on Sept 4-5 (timesheet product, $2,474 AUD ex-GST annually), demonstrating repeatability of sales process.

3. **Future Engagement Options** - Three paths discussed:
   - Option 1: Boney runs independently with playbooks
   - Option 2: Sachee stays as strategic advisor (4-8 hrs/week)
   - Option 3: Fractional exec role (1-2 days/week with hands-on execution)

4. **Financial Reality Check** - Burn rate concerns; 3 months runway remaining (~60K left of 100K Boney invested). Need to reach break-even by Dec 2025 (acknowledged as impossible) or raise funding for 18-month runway.

5. **Revenue Modeling** - Need ~150-300 accounts to reach 1M ARR. Target is 15K MRR as confidence milestone before hiring additional sales team.

## Decisions Made

- Boney prefers **Option 3** (fractional exec + strategic advisor) - wants hands-on support
- Compensation structure: Delayed cash payments until 1M ARR milestone + equity (4.5% proposed)
- Sachee cannot commit full-time immediately; earliest would be Jan-Feb 2026
- Need to build self-sufficient internal sales team
- Agreement to develop detailed engagement plan with clear deliverables

## Notable Quotes

> "By November we might... either we are in a position to cut down everyone, at least in the sales and marketing. I need to go and find someone else to get me another 50k or probably I'm not sure about what at that point of time I need to do." — Boney

> "The impact I can have is by helping people like you to execute. Because you have, you probably haven't seen what I have seen..." — Sachee
