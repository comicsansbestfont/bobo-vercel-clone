Sandy Balakrishnan | 00:16
Has a good day, man, good.
Sachee Perera | 00:17
Good morning. [Laughter] How are you doing?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 00:23
Just had my breakfast, little break and then back in. Yeah, I mean, it's really... It's a very rainy week, actually.
Sachee Perera | 00:27
Very good. How is your weekend?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 00:36
I mean, like, the tropical rain in Kela can be very high.
So I haven't gone out too much because the roads are really wet. It can get really dirty. Then I have to come around and watch the car and all of that. I haven't gone out much at all. A bit of things to do with learning.
Sachee Perera | 00:53
Okay. Little bit.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 00:58
And yeah, it's been slowly. But I actually ended up playing a bit of DA too. I'm on the final chapters of it, so I spent a bit of time.
Sachee Perera | 01:07
Of it. So, I spent a bit of.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:12
Yeah, otherwise I just read some books. So, yeah,
it's been good. I just took a bit of rest. I actually ended up calling some of my friends in Australia and some back in Singapore, so that kept me busy. So, yeah, that's the thing.
I've been talking to a bit of them. There's a lot of things going around. Trying to catch up with some of my old school friends down here because I've been away for a very long long.
Sachee Perera | 01:42
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:42
I'm just trying to find their whereabouts. Those who are in the town, some of them came from abroad for a bit, so I'm just trying to get a bit of that. That's it, man.
It's a slow one. It's been a bit slow after I left Australia anyway, so how about you? Did you have some fun?
Sachee Perera | 02:02
I did I do? I didn't do much. I wanted to go for a walk, but because I had surgery recently, my knee tore, so I can't. Or sorry, my knee is torn, so I can't. Every weekend I'm trying to go for a little walk outside to.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 02:15
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 02:19
To, you know, it back up again.
But, the weather was't that great, [Laughter] so I didn't end up going.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 02:25
No, that's... I know it can be a bit of a heartbreaker. I used to... I actually recover from a little bit of an injury. I almost... I had a bit of an injury on my leg and carried out from Australia, which stopped my gym flow for a bit.
Sachee Perera | 02:38
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 02:44
So I'm just picking back up so I can feel that it's been nasty. But I came down here, I got easy access to the treatment. It was a Speedy recovery. But yet I don't want to put a... Anyway, I'm heavy, so I don't want to put a lot of strain on my leg and make it worse, so I just strain my upper body.
It's not an easy thing.
Sachee Perera | 03:07
Enough.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 03:08
Yeah, with that.
Sachee Perera | 03:08
The physio, man, you need to go and see a physio. Ever since I've started seeing my physio, I can walk properly. I couldn't walk properly before, so... Yeah, I know you're busy, so I quickly wanted to spend about 20-30 minutes today. Today I'm trying to just go through your workflow on how you like when you're reaching out to clients from when they're a cold lead or fresh lead to how you run the workflow through the CRM or whatever systems you use currently.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 03:52
Like so very exactly looking the which have the systems from where to where or how we run the day.
Sachee Perera | 04:02
The yeah, the sales process, let's say, you know, your goal, you're trying to get demos right. Let's say by the end of this week we want to get five demos or five trials happening.
What's the workflow that you follow?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 04:22
Great. So before I jump into that, I just wanna quick chat with you. How did Bonnie introduce me? As to you? As in what role has he introduc to you?
Sachee Perera | 04:36
A a sales manager?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 04:38
M cool. So that gives me a bit of perspective.
So here's the thing. When I started off, I came in. Look, I came in to actually build this. What you said, the sales first, build out the sales process, get their agents up to speed and help them run and start taking around those calls. cont.
Sachee Perera | 04:54
Okay.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 05:02
Take out the... Help with the demo and help with the calling and help with the end-to-end sales process, as you say, in startups, wear many hats and all of those. This month I actually started stepping into being almost like a founding... I connect security, right?
So when you ask about the process, the reason I actually told you is that I've been running that from the very beginning of the month. I started. I'm pretty much helping Kavida to set that process in the first place because there was no process, it was ground zero.
So I'm just giving context.
Sachee Perera | 05:41
Yp.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 05:41
So what I'm doing, where I'm going with it, for various reasons, I was coming in to a place just like you to see what is working, what they have been doing, and then run it with the narrative and figure out what's the process they need. They weren't ready. They weren't ready to get all the processes in place. What they were only ready for was a call demo. In two weeks, to the trial,
yeah, and jump into payment. That's the thing. So here's the thing, what I do and what I'm doing right now, I started off when I'm coming in, we had marketing. Marketing used to use the Apollo, and I can probably show you they used to run a four-week sequence, a generic sequence to a lead that has been taken out that has been run from a second-rate domain.
It's in the name of Inick. We used to shoot the emails. Keep going through the cycle in the first four weeks. I was able to kick-launch in April. The start of April in the first four weeks when I came in, mainly two things I had to set down over there. I need to get in the tools to get running.
So we didn't have an active dialer until five weeks in. So that is the end of May. So we were jumping around dialers, we don't have a paid dialer, and there was a lot of mess up. So troubleshooting all of those is what I've been doing to set the processes.
I know the processes to have to be set. So first things, the dial had been set and nearer to dial set that has been set simultaneously. I kept spending two to two hours with Kavita to set her to train her because she had no... Very frankly speaking, today, this is something she's not yet there. I know it was ground zero when she came in there.
Sachee Perera | 07:23
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 07:24
And there was a lot of cultural training, a lot of industry training.
Sachee Perera | 07:29
Are you seeing her face to face or are you seeing her face to face or in teens?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 07:29
Everything has to be. She is in Chennai. So it is through teams.
It's a video call. Yeah, I li yeah, it's a video called. She's in Chennai. She's not in the state either. Which is like the neighboring state.
Sachee Perera | 07:46
Okay. Yp.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 07:49
So, it took her four to five weeks running her basic things. Running through all the basics. Then we ran a couple of... Not a couple of every day. Pretty wanted to. We used to do more calls, and trial calls setting it up.
I came in and I wrote a basic script because they had a script. Probably they already shared it with you. When I came in, I did a generic script at the point in time, the product was... No, it was like I said, it was the idea was for three mentions, May and June online, one software. We don't know where the product market fits. Even now, it is getting on the journey.
So, I created a generic script where you can do the called open nose.
Sachee Perera | 08:36
He.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 08:36
Then I created a digger dip each for each LA for finances. This probably I'll just have a quick show with you that gives you the idea where I'm at. Just give me a second.
Yeah. It's already open here.
Do you see any screens that are being shared?
Sachee Perera | 09:15
I see you. I see your face without the beard [Laughter] and in a suit.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 09:23
Alright, this thing is.
Sachee Perera | 09:31
So back to Kaitta. Sorry. So she works fully remotely. She has no access to Nisha or any of the team members or anything face-to-face at the moment.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 09:44
No, if she has to do that, she will have to relocate.
Sachee Perera | 09:44
Okay, y.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 09:50
I don't know if it is even viable to that because she is in the other state and she's been particular. When she joined, she was looking for remote as well.
We offer remote to get that in selling and reducer.
Sachee Perera | 10:02
Understood. Yeah, I haven't spoken to her yet.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 10:07
So this, just give me a EAs easy.
Sachee Perera | 10:10
I haven't spoken to her yet. She sounds really young.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 10:14
She is. She's pretty young. It's like one to two, and just getting to it. She's getting her way with things, so I don't know if it's any better?
Sachee Perera | 10:25
Yeah, no.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 10:28
Can you see the screens with it? This is okay.
It's much easier to share with the other one.
Sachee Perera | 10:37
It steams.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 10:38
It shows the diff, yeah. Just give me a second. I'll do one more thing and probably pull that once monitoring screen.
Still, it's the same. You can only see me.
Sachee Perera | 11:02
Yeah. Do you want to try Team? Do you want?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 11:05
Yeah, we'll jump in. Just. Yeah, just give me our out Hotmail D. Have they given you an email ID from the Outlook or?
Sachee Perera | 11:13
No. How about, you send me the link, [Laughter] to.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 11:17
Yeah, I'll do that.
Sachee Perera | 11:18
Alright, cool.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 11:19
Sure.
Sachee Perera | 11:37
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 11:38
Hey, yeah, you're right.
Sachee Perera | 11:39
I can see. Now, hey, Heyr.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 11:42
Cool, yeah, good.
Sachee Perera | 11:42
Cool.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 11:45
So in the first two weeks, I came in and got the scripts from these guys over here. I just created a base one for Kawai to get us a guideline. We're not fixing exactly.
Okay, this is exactly the script. You go like an open framework because things were everything was pretty much fluid. So, what are the openers to get around and for her task Burton was to set an appointment to set.
So basically at that point in time, it was like Dad going to the demo. We were not doing any qualification. Rather, we didn't have the time, the space, or the thing to do any qualification there. They were in a hurry to just get a demo and get a trial because from my understanding till date, we don't have people who are actually external people who actually tried our software.
Maybe Bonnie has some indents they started somewhere in CHN actually. Neither have they been a much dog-forwarding or like the internal team working on it, neither the externals who have worked trials.
So, the critical Russ over there was to get the demo in and understand two things: product-market fit and actually shoot the trial in and actually try and see if the software is working to the needs. So, I kept it pretty simple to get the demos in. The qualifications were kept at a minimum, and at the same time, it was hard to get the qualifiers that the calls were much worse off to start with.
So, we started working a bit down over there. We set it in. Then, I went on to build a questionnaire for each section in order to get to the leads and create all of those. So just a precursor to creating the process like getting the qualification in if it's an operational side, if it's a financial side, if it's an infrastructure side. How to go on with this in the first month or so? Did the list that we worked with?
It's pretty much businesses at 25 and a 40. It was a list we pulled directly from Apollo SaaS. We just started calling into it. It was very primitive. We didn't have this, we didn't have HubSpot licenses, anything that we were still talking around with them, and Bonnie wanted to keep it in Zoho.
Then we had HubSpot that was working for the marketing in terms of inbound and all of those. So we were pretty much just spending a good amount of time with the CRMs and trying to figure out which one was
the one. The pricing was too expensive for him to start with, so we had to push it to the side. What we did is since the marketing has already started, outreach has picked up that calling list, and we showed out by calling into it.
That is my first idea to understand what's going on here. What's the demand generation? Because there was no demand generation whatsoever, and we came to very soon realize you're not even to reach a... You can't even reach half of the list. The contact, anything you're getting from there is basically the company contact. Either it's a VRs, or you're just getting blocked by the gatekeeper, typical call list which monitor customers. When you got into it, that list was there.
It's very... We haven't connected too much data then. We were just fixing and figuring out what all we need. A lot of things are going in the background, from splitting the features, the products and everything. We got an idea. We're reaching out to those, they're not working. The clients we have spoken to, they already have something in place because that's a category you're looking at, and we haven't defined this.
So what we've done from there is in that first list, we got one customer in. So that's the current group, and he is a project admin, and the majority of the contacts we are going to CCT over there. So we picked him, and I said, "Okay, this is working."
At that point in time, it was June, early May, and you were focusing to sell it all. The software. The highlight, according to Bonny, at that point in time, is project management and scheduling and all other things can be done.
Okay. If you're doing that, then your target most likely will be project managers. Project officers, the person who is actually going to use the suit, right? We talk to them, we work up to there and see what's in place.
So I went around to pull another list, which wasn't that great of a list because there were a lot of repetitions. But in the segment, pretty much what I did is to have an idea. Each market I split it across three states: Melbourne, Sydney, ACT. We didn't go further than that to see how each market is there primarily. We know where this market very closely. Bonny was in Melbourne.
If you get a demo because of the first demos, one or two, we can actually send him on the site and get it done, just to help him get a process. So we started with that, and when we had a major list again, the culture leads were more than half. We couldn't reach them. A lot of them went with the IVS, and it came with a lot of pushback we got at that time. We were refining our skills and we put it to the side. We got an MQ coming in that one. We nurtured it. We had, in fact, two or three MQ coming in when you got back. They have no clue of reaching us, talking to us, and there's not contacting any of those. This happened.
So that list ran for early last month. This is June, and I put a stop saying, "Look, we want to scroll at mass and go around mass. We had done that running around a huge list. Now we need to target. Because I need to start setting the processes at that time, he hasn't put a set value this much. You want to close the idea? The idea was vaguely the idea is you get ten customers in and then Bonni one to move to India.
That's the kind of setting there. What he needed to do with that. So he said, "Look, we need to target." We had that point last month, early last month, we came up with splitting the features and slowly moving the narrative to just two modules within the software, which is timesheet and scheduling.
What led to that? The moves. The two other customers we are talking with, one needed pretty much secure check-in, the other was around time sheets. None of the customers were showing any kind of update for the project management asset. They couldn't connect with it. There wasn't relevance.
In order to support that, the first list I gave you, the Melbourne timesheets and scheduling one, so that was a targeted one. Again, we pulled from Apollo. We targeted just into Melbourne and we just targeted project officers and project admins.
In the segment that is, let's just say, between five and ten million in that business range, we reached out to them. We had a bit more insight coming from that list. If you probably had a look at that ML list, we got some of the competitors down there who specifically told us they're not interested. They already have a solution in place.
So we got some insights. We didn't get demos directly at that point in time, but some of them showed interest. But over the last two, like three or four weeks, we were still working with some of the leads that were positive, and we got one booked in for tomorrow.
Sachee Perera | 18:58
And we got one book booked in for tomorrow.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 19:01
It's a.
Sachee Perera | 19:01
It's a tentatively has book.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 19:01
Tentatively he has booked it because the main person we are talking to, he planned a move, didn't turn up. We chased him for three to four weeks again, it was dead silence. So I went into Apollo and checked on a few other contacts and shared their contacts for him and Ted. Ask...
Okay, go around and ask the business. There might be a way we can go around with it. So you ask to another project engineer within the business. You come to learn that the person who has taken a medical leave and the next person is okay to take a court booking, but it's not like they're well-qualified.
It's like, "Okay, they're open to take a booking and explore with us." What they need over there. So that is what I send an email in. We'll be confirming and sending the demo invite today afternoon because he asked to call up in the afternoon.
So that's what happened there. That is a quick list. Around 153 contacts were there, but around 53 companies. We got some good insights. What's working? When we were very targeted, we were getting the results and I could see some patterns. What's invalid?
So from there I started to move into a process where I can set those stages. So first things for Kavia, we gave her a MAS list, and this time we were scrubbing the list.
Sachee Perera | 20:14
This list. And this time we were scrubbing the list.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 20:16
Like I said from Yellow Pages, the idea is she more or less represented the role of an STR going with the volumes ideally like a 50 to 60 calls then usually what you see reach out to them and try to bring down to see who is the interest and move around gradually.
Sachee Perera | 20:16
Like I said from Yellow Pages. The idea is she, according with the volumes in 60 then usually what you see: write out to them and try to break them into say to and more.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 20:33
In a couple of weeks' time, I want to introduce qualifications for her. Either band or medi pick, depending on what the need of.
Sachee Perera | 20:38
Bit depending on what you like questioning on the time.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 20:40
Like, what's the need of the TE?
Sachee Perera | 20:41
What's easier for us to if you from the beginning.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 20:41
What's easier for us to manage over here? She was taken off the CR from the beginning. One, we don't have the proper licenses to the CRM to actually run it.
Sachee Perera | 20:46
One really doesn't have the portal licenses to the CR to actually avoid it like with all the dashboards. We have to go to the next year to support this decision and it's going to take it has to be really to take.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 20:50
Like with all the dashboards, which is we'll have to go to the next year, which again is a bonus decision if it's going to take. It has to be an early one to take.
And all of those.
Sachee Perera | 20:59
So I puly disting and from the latest list that you've seen in the PS today is going from pretty much what you have seen.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 20:59
So at this stage she's running purely an SDR thing. And from the latest list that you have seen, the Melbourne Yellow Pages. She's going from that. Pretty much whatever you can see in a normal Cerum has been set with the number of turns, monocles, the nods, the highlights have given columns for a band, but since you're still playing around a lot of them with the gatekeepers, we can't do much of a ban there until you reach a PCS.
Sachee Perera | 21:09
And as we said with small cos, the notes have calls for band, but since you're still playing the role, the gatekeepers become and they are particularly the CSP as can and so that is one side.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 21:23
PCS is less than 10 or 15%.
So that's one side. And this came because we started to look beyond Apollo for leads marketing.
Sachee Perera | 21:27
And because we started to look beyond the MO fun, these markets can start soon, it would be reasonable.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 21:32
Kind of said it's literally almost impossible to get.
Sachee Perera | 21:35
So to get at the time, setting it's hard to get any CS market, how that is working.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 21:37
At the current setting, it's hard to get any MQLs, but I'll leave that to marketing how that is working.
So, it's predominantly an outbound.
Sachee Perera | 21:43
So it's for the report, so what? High existing as, so one, it focuses on high quality and account-based ONS.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 21:45
So what I thought over here is, okay, I need to come up with a hybrid role. We don't have existing accounts, so what I can focus on is high-quality intent-based like our account-based marketing one.
So, that's what I need to do. I'm putting together a process for the buyer in it.
Sachee Perera | 21:57
Further for the pilot, and like I said, who has been sitting on the website researching on the topic, which is normally for intent signals at the moment, HubSpot has been using it for two categories: time scheduling.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 22:03
Like I said, who is visiting on the website, who is researching on the topic, which is normally equal intent signals. At the moment, HubSpot has one. We are using it for two categories of time scheduling, and we are pulling it into the CRM, and I'm working from here.
Sachee Perera | 22:16
And so, we're pulling it again into the same room and working from here. But it is not set as you want to see your books space and all over, you probably might as well see access.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 22:20
But it is not set as such. Normally, as you're on an account, you need your own workspace and dashboards and everything. You probably might have seen here. You need access to sales workforce to see.
Sachee Perera | 22:30
Sorry I lost access to your screen.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 22:31
These are the... I don't have access yet.
Sachee Perera | 22:33
I just see a black screen at the moment. So it was only black, sorry. Are you yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 22:42
Okay, right, that's yeah.
Sachee Perera | 22:45
So where you have sales for two sizes, this is what the normal data looks like.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 22:45
So here, this is the next thing you get with sales workforce. This is where the normal dashboards and account executive will look like.
These are the accounts. This is what I'm working on. These are the callbacks.
Sachee Perera | 22:57
All you can do is see a whole list of companies.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 22:57
All of this will be here, and the moment is generic.
What we do is I have... You can see a whole list of companies over here.
Sachee Perera | 23:05
So over here, you can see a whole list of contracts if you go to it.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 23:06
You can see a whole list of contacts over here if you go to it.
Sachee Perera | 23:09
So I just have a little list.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 23:09
So I just created a list. There are some limitations on what you can do over here.
Sachee Perera | 23:12
There are some limitations. Would you like to know? So limiting age, so is the what they are coming from the top.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 23:15
So I created a list segregating each. The idea is the one that is coming from the topics that are being researched are putting it under the list, a certain set of companies, the one who are probably on the website into another one.
Sachee Perera | 23:30
And this code against strong behavior that I will put the 153 levels back into here that at the moment that like... at CC.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 23:30
And the this was like a pilot I was doing what Kavia has just finished. We agreed that... Okay, I will put the 01:53 condx here. Let an call from XEL if we are making meaningful progress, we'll bring it over here out of that. At the moment, we have 3 that is working. I used it and I said those were invalid, I'll remove it from here. That was like putting the stepping stones to bring her on.
Because right now, if you jump her on, you need to learn and you need to train her in your set process and her volume at speeds and everything is slow. I want to get the speeds in. She's better fast with there.
So I jumped in myself in the last two weeks to start setting the process myself, and I kind of took on the role of a working ad hoc with both the things.
Sachee Perera | 24:07
To start setting the process myself.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 24:13
That's not what I initially set out to do completely, but that's what I started doing, started putting the accounts around here.
Sachee Perera | 24:17
So can you define what you... You just mentioned that's not what you initially set out to do, and you made a comment about... How did Bonnie introduce you? What were you originally set out to do?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 24:35
So I was actually bought in to do the ad hoc head of sales thing. You'll get the team in, we get the reps in and you set the whole process and you start running and I will do this calling and everything. I'm happy to do work and row. Not like full time in it, but in his mind it is...
It's like you are getting an ad hoc salesperson, and if you want to run him full time as an STR, that's probably not what I'm signed up for it.
Sachee Perera | 24:56
Salesp.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 25:04
So I'll do like a founding account executive, I'll do the high-end ones and I'll set all of the other processes in.
But that's it. It has gone a little probably that is fine. We need to get the things inserted in the longer run out to figure out the one at. So we wanted we wanted Kawa to set in kind of the bookings in. Me and Bonnie will help with all the meetings and end-to-end sales. We bring in... We'll put together the materials, we'll put together the pitch tags, what is required for the clients, all of those will come in.
But the volumes and everything has been slow and the demand generation side was very weak. We need to first set it up. So I was setting all those up and were coming in, and in order to get this process calling into the ACS meeting bookings all of that to be set in, I had jumped in hands-on as an account executive over here until this process is set.
Sachee Perera | 25:46
To get this process of setting se.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 25:58
So eventually I'll be training Kawa into it and probably we might need an... Eventually, when you have the kind of resources to get the properly in, probably that won't be as sales, but until then get the process of refinement and get the bookings in all of those.
That's why I asked you how you look. Because one if one doesn't know the whole process of sales and the hierarchies in it, they can easily mistake what is what role, what they intended to do, what they had not intended to do.
Sachee Perera | 26:18
This one is the processted to do or not in the se.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 26:30
It's not like what not. And I kind of understand in the settings of a startup, it will be... What's the thing? Okay, so while I'm at it, I need to because she hasn't seen much. She needs to know how it is run. I took her actively to do that, and this is how I set it.
It's a basic setting. Like I said, we got your accounts over here. Let's just say sorted electrical which was working last week. I put all the details, I put it on here from the systems. There won't be any context. I populate the context for that.
That's what I'm using. Apollo or Lucia, where I use a bit of link, the sales navigator website to get around standard things. We create all the nodes. We do create all the logs of the calls.
You can see the calls I made. You'll find the details. Emails I have been initially sending through Outlook. Within a week or so, I started figuring and sending through the system and I integrated it myself over here so that it is easy to track and see what's going on.
Sachee Perera | 27:23
So trying to figure out a second COR system. I think myself over here so that it is easy to see what's going on.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 27:31
And then I had a couple of calls with that. These people have responded. I just got it on Friday saying he doesn't need the service, he has to respond back with an email.
Sachee Perera | 27:41
[Laughter] How if I want to listen to some of those calls that you logged here.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 27:43
So that's how the process going all the task now when.
Sachee Perera | 27:50
Are those calls in the dial pad?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 27:53
Ta. Cosson dial pad. And then I have brought it. Like, the coalst I'm actually getting. I'm putting it into the, you know, the cloud one I shared for you.
Sachee Perera | 28:03
Yeah. Okay, so I wanted to listen to the call from... Because I want to hear what they say when you first reach out to them.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 28:04
So, yeah, if you want this one, I can put it. It's in the one drive that I already shared with you.
Sachee Perera | 28:24
Right? Like, so was it the call Panther Protective? Did you speak to them? Or did Kawita speak to them? Or was it both? You did.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 28:34
I spoke to them. I spoke to them, yeah, and I already put it over here. Let me just... Yeah, it's there on Friday. We're in there, so if you have gone there, I have added more to it.
Sachee Perera | 28:49
I? Seeing of the laps.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 28:50
Yeah, it's just loading up. So mostly mine. Once I'm putting it there, you'll find the name of the company itself that you're going with it. Because in Dialpad, that full integration has not been completed yet. The reason is again with the licensing of the HubSpot. Ideally, if that is sorted, it might map to the HubSpot, but that's not a huge problem.
Sachee Perera | 29:07
I believe that it's already mi. Back to the code. S.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 29:11
You can just download.
But if you come to this... It's just playing around a bit, right? If you go for this one, I kept adding more holes in. So this is the one we lost the other day. That's the Kawita one. I already said in the sales meeting over there, and I added a few more. I can see earlier listening to a few...
So probably if you go through it, you'll get more. These ones with the names that we're mostly seeing in Michaels. There is Panther over here, there is Precision Horns, then there is as building, Panther is actually Tristan's...
Yeah, actually, the point of contact I've been talking to, right? It's like the first call to him. The ones that are not pulled over here are if it is getting to an automated I VR and IP 1, it doesn't add much value. What you're looking for is Michaels.
But Michaels, like I said, it's very few because this thing what I actively jump into has just started two weeks on putting it together, right? And I've been pretty... You'll find there that's what I'm putting together. Like this, you'll get a couple of ones. In terms of process, my way is I go into the account, I work my way up rather than immediately jumping into the high-level person and getting probably a no. One coming down, which I'm okay with going both ways, but I feel I like collecting more data and going up the level.
When you get to those people, you want to talk to, you have pretty decent information on who is the who in the business if you're not even finding it on the websites and LinkedIn. I go with the data. I research that, I go in and out a bit, how much I know. Then I do an ORT over there. I'm more of a... I've been trained in a Challenger sales model.
That's been what I practiced. Then I had done a bit of Medipac for this kind of setting and product. Eventually, I want to move into a Medipac way, and I'll be setting those processes in here when I get it.
But this is a kind of workflow. What do you see me like if you ask me how my day is? Front. I usually have a singer with Kavia. Sometimes it can go up to... In our initial days, it used to go a lot because she needed a lot more help with many things. Now, these days it's shorter, I can keep it to 15 minutes or 20, but normally I serve for half an hour. Pick up certain accounts if you need to work with each of them. Generally, that's...
So I used to have one catch-up with her in the morning. Usually 30 minutes or so. Then I usually had a catch-up with Bonnie. I usually go up to 45 minutes and sometimes up to an hour. We usually settle for 15 minutes. These days they are shorter. Then we have a leadership meeting that usually is half an hour. Initial days, it used to go 45 minutes.
All these days it was kept shorter, half an hour. Then in the ad hoc, in between, I have maybe one or two catch-ups with Kavia. At that point, I was listening to the calls. So, jumping in there, there are a lot of issues in the beginning. I had to jump in after each call to correct and stop and reject. Now, these days she's getting much better with it.
Sachee Perera | 32:14
Much gettinged.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 32:15
After all the correctional thing, that's what.
Sachee Perera | 32:15
After the control thing. That's so mo.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 32:18
So right now, I have a single hand in the morning. Then Bonnie has me just first because he's moved to India. We have leadership in between. What are the ad hoc administrative tasks that I need to do? Her with her leaves and everything, I just put it short. Then I come over here and work through these ones. If the management leads management things, papers, or whatever we need, it's ad hoc.
Sachee Perera | 32:38
Soty five minutes when my race is here with.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 32:40
Some days it's integration today with Kite's getting her. For her, it's the first day she's trying to work with us. I was trying to get all the Outlook and everything linked, but she has some IT issues, so I already sent it down to IT to fix it.
I showed her how her account has been brought over here, how to log tickets and everything. So, it's been a bit of ad hoc, but my idea over here is within four or five weeks when my process is here. When they look, they can see what to manage ANCONE as an account executive or a BBM who does this like enwent and set the dashboards for that.
Sachee Perera | 33:07
Then they can say what is s.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 33:17
When I get the license in time so I can have what an account executive views, what accounts, how many, which are the priorities, and which tasks are coming up.
Sachee Perera | 33:19
In place so they can with what the bones, how many WNs, how many WISS with things that are coming, which has been that.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 33:26
I can set that align actually two of those because eventually Kavia has to be working in here. We'll set that for her as well.
Sachee Perera | 33:34
So have you used what was the CRM that you're used to?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 33:40
Like in my past, or do you mean I have used a couple of them? I have spent a good amount of time in Salesforce. I have used Dynamics then.
Sachee Perera | 33:50
Okay.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 33:51
Yeah. Then Hubspot I have used for a small brief amount of time, but pretty much I've been here. I figured out how it is going to run because they have their own set of things going here.
Sachee Perera | 33:52
Is Hubs okay? Sure.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 34:06
Zoho is new. When I came here, I figured out running their CRM.
But their CRM may be cheaper for them, but it is too much. There is a lot of unnecessary things, and it doesn't feel very... That itself becomes a mini project. I think Hubspot is very simple and easy to use.
Sachee Perera | 34:28
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 34:29
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 34:29
The sales workspace is pretty new, and we don't actually need to upgrade to that. That functionality is probably not going to be of any use to us because, yeah, I'm a HubSpot admin, and I don't think we do. Can you just quickly go into the user permissions into your own? Yup, and then scroll down and go to objects. Yep.
Then click sorry, actually, can you go to the users? Yep, and can you find me on there? Yep, and edit permissions. Okay, so view all contacts. That's good. Keep scrolling down. Scroll down.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 35:44
That's it.
Sachee Perera | 35:44
That's okay then go to sales.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 35:45
For the CRM objects. Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 35:55
Yeah scroll down. Yeah, can you turn on sales access?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 36:03
Six.
Sachee Perera | 36:03
Yep. Scroll down. Yes, and meeting scheduling pages as well.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 36:13
Yeah, the deal stages were where we had tried a trial on sales workspace. The deal stages, the percentage, the changes were all behind the sales workspace at that point in time. Actually, I wanted to... I think I'll generally set that up.
That's when I spoke with the rep. We realized that the deal stages, how the deals move.
Sachee Perera | 36:34
The that how you want to do the sure.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 36:36
How do you want to do the progress between the different percentages of deal qualification forecasting all seats over here? They have moved it into the workspace licensing. Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 36:46
Can you turn on the meeting scheduling pages? Yup, and then you scroll back up and then go to automation. I don't need that.
That's okay. Marketing. Can you turn on forms and down?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 37:10
2222.
Sachee Perera | 37:14
Yup. Keep scrolling down. No, we don't need any of that. We can scroll up and then keep scrolling all the way back up, and then, can you go into automation?
Okay, cool, that's yep, that's fine. And then I think that's it. Hit save.
Cool. Yeah. I just needed the sales access because I didn't have that sales component. Alright, just really quickly. I know we've gone over time. So you said you there were some accounts that have high intent. How do you see that workflow from the high intent to getting the demo?
What's the workflow? Do you have a framework in your head, what does that look like?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 38:29
So currently we are building it out. So what it looks like in my mind, roughly what it is, because there's two weeks in putting together. So this is how it looks.
First of all, we move the buyer to what we have seen over here to an account list specifically of those and consider it's like an account manager's account patch where he's outreaching for Newbies, right? Start engaging them in multiple points.
Sachee Perera | 38:53
Multiple point.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 38:54
At the moment, I'm not doing the LinkedIn over here except for the LinkedIn. What we're doing is we're doing emails. We are calling into the icons, those icons that doesn't have the provisions of an email or call. We are even dropping in a message from their website.
Sachee Perera | 39:07
Dropping in a basic from different sites so necessarily the same thing it person if you feel it in the contact of the person you can go to my contact and thermal process.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 39:09
So has put a message and try to unlock two to three different people. Most of the times' admin. After one or two emails is send, we see if the emails has been picked and read and if not we call in and try to see okay, who is the admin, who's the person down there? Figure out from here who's an experts person.
If you have the data contact of that person you can call to. We called them in order to find contacts and everything. This doesn't give context. We use the HubSpot and I use Apollo and I use LuSay. Then I go to the website if I can get it, that's where I get the contacts. A lot of oftentimes you work it up.
So that's where the normal process goes from there.
Sachee Perera | 39:46
Goesing is when I get a con they start codifying trying to find segments within the business if they get an opportunity to see have service of right and my.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 39:48
My thing is when I get into the when I get in the calls over there, I start qualifying the leads, trying to find where's the gaps within the business if I get an opportunity. Introducing ourselves as a product.
And from there, I'm actually inviting them to check around that demo. Not going very hard. Pusher on qualification, we have very few to work with, so that's one step from there and taking them from there into a demo. Our demos, if you have seen in the past, has been a mix of discovery and then a demo. We are not very much specialized in anything at that point.
Sachee Perera | 40:21
In time.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 40:22
And those times when you're happening, we are pretty much open as well.
Sachee Perera | 40:23
And I think from the nice book what exactly they're looking at.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 40:26
So once we get into the demo, probably got a second call to them when it's booked in, maybe a day or before. What's exactly they're looking at if they're a color and if they're coming up, it's not a no-show.
And take that insights then and they'll be coming back to Bonnie and setting up.
Sachee Perera | 40:38
And we're coming back to Bali.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 40:41
Okay? These are the areas they're looking at. This is the form of business. This is who is the who. This is probably what he's looking at.
And then we go into the demo and demo, like I said, because the early stages, we haven't put together a deck and all of those yet. A lot of things were fed. Now we can earlier we couldn't because it's just like open, it's product market fit.
Sachee Perera | 40:58
I can. Because it's just like.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 41:03
Even Bonnie is figuring what's a product market fit, to be very honest, right? We're only getting close to there, so we're going a bit open-ended there. I'm pretty good at challenging and bringing things out of people when I get it over there. Partially I rely on my subject a bit. I'm a little bit of a subject metric because I've done it.
If it's a concession guy, I can just handle around there. And here I get a bit no better of the local markets. Can swing a bit of rapper building from there as well and just open up and, from the call we get.
Okay, what's the sense? At the moment, Bonnie is the only person who can demo the whole product. Who knows the whole product in and out. But Bonnie isn't great at demoing. His communication skills are a bit down.
So I have gone through a few rounds with him to set how the demos are done. The first ones weren't that great. I didn't record them. So I helped him to combat the mealize and focus and do it better in the areas where I had to step in.
If you listen to Ksenia's call, it.
Sachee Perera | 42:02
If you listen to.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 42:05
I know Ksenia wasn't as qualified as Elte. Kavia booked in was an early late that came in. But we are losing the interest of the customer then and there result.
Sachee Perera | 42:14
As step and [Laughter] you can went faster.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 42:14
So I stepped in and took it a little bit faster, like knowing the pace of the customer.
So eventually cracking the demos in. How the demos are going. Right now the demos are really going along. I some of the demos have been an hour and all. It wasn't prelanned.
I was understanding how you demo the product from a Bonnie standpoint. How is that? And then I said you can cut it down surely, what is required? Show them how you navigate, come down over here.
So I really that first demo call is a mixmash, understand a little bit, connect the areas where they can ring a bell or they might not have. Showcase them maybe two or three main features. And from there we had to take a next step action for the next one.
Sachee Perera | 42:59
The next for the next one.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 43:02
Okay, which are the areas if they need to bring more people in? Yes, more people in. How can we help you with a demo? Ideally, internally, we said, "Okay, it's two weeks. Do the roadmap to what is required to do the demo." What is required for the demo?
It's again an ongoing process. Bonnie is putting together a checklist if it's time sheets, XYZ that these many things you need. We went on building that with our first customer. So that's the process over there from Bonnie's side, if that's the pricing, then he needs to work on the closing, the pricing, the final deals. I have mentioned him from day one and two, you need to work through the SLAs, you need to work through the agreements. Agreements are not yet there, so he needs to work through those aspects.
Sachee Perera | 43:49
Not so. It needs to suspect what they see as you versus what looks like for the open like.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 43:52
What the SLAs look like? What's the support look like? How do they learn the contract? How are the payments made?
I mean, it's a yearly break down. What's the parts? What kind of agreement? For that? Bonnie said you can mix match a combination of a dial pad and what they have over here. So those are the things. I will leave that sales operations side a little down to Bonnie's side to figure that out because my point is to get up to the demo, qualify in and get into the trial at this stage.
So that's what the process looks like at the moment when it is refined. I would like to see it as you look like in a sales engine, like stages of how many qualifications...
It's a call. Lead. You qualify. A lead, you get your opportunity, you have your demos booked in.
Sachee Perera | 44:36
We call it GA visibility. You the most per Canva.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 44:39
There'll be probably around 60% in the sales process when you have your pricing and proposal.
Sachee Perera | 44:40
It will be probably around 60% in the sales process going you your pricing and proposal making your trial to 90%.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 44:45
When you have your trials in, you'll get to your own 80% and probably 90% when you have that purchase order in and hand off.
I've been told that, Nisha, will be probably looking around the customer's success and all of those.
Sachee Perera | 44:58
If I be the problem with the customer's success among those.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 45:01
I'm not sure how that shapes up, but that again, there are a lot of moving elements at this stage. There's only so much you can do in 90 to 90 days or so from one point to one.
Sachee Perera | 45:09
Can do it. One point to one feels like just the stri you know kind of thing so I can replicate the kind of process for coming and picking a scape.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 45:15
And feel I'm just laying this on so the account executive slash BDM kind of thing can replicate the process for Kavia and do it at a scale without knowing right now she has some veloc.
Sachee Perera | 45:24
And has that on [Laughter]... Say what can we do differently if I can contact with the different things for it of those and those that she can work or slightly more than she can bring it over here.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 45:26
It took time. Now she has a velocity week to week. She gets her leads on every Tuesday. She calls that up, plus she goes back to the old ones and I go back to a list and see what we can do differently.
If I can come back with a different pitch for each of those, and Englishly, I'm seeing those that she can book or slightly qualified, she can bring it over here. That's the idea.
Then I can jump in and probablyly, I can engage and work with it.
So that's the kind of thing shaping up areas where I can think improve. SAS is pulling in Apollo we are using. I'm integrated there. This later I'll probably pull together a dashboard they can see and plug in directly to the power BI ideally when this is on the next year of licensing dialpad call should come up automatically over here and recognized with the account which it doesn't happen right now.
Sachee Perera | 46:11
This is something from the next day. FL.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 46:20
I try it there.
It's a limitation of Hasport.
Sachee Perera | 46:23
What they can exchange is not just a space.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 46:23
They have kept it in the next year. The icon-based marketing is kept for the next year. It's not just the workspace. If you go to the icons that I've worked on over here.
Sachee Perera | 46:30
If people see the eight points, we can say that it's happening, and it's a small thing. If you know this, but there is permission to know that if the person has come to the resources and admitted that the use is so they would feed themselves. They were looking to function and control this kind of sly.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 46:35
Look, it's not a one-sided thing. It's not a huge thing that is happening, but then it's a smaller thing. So we are limiting. You can know your open and all of this, but there is a provision to know that if the person has come to the website, where they have gone to, which pages they have explored, when they have looked after ours, any resources.
I've seen this when I've been with the demos with the hubs for the A account, EXCU D teams, how they are looking into our accounts. All this is slightly gatekeeper in their workspace over there, but if we have it, it'll be much easier to run it otherwise.
Probably you're running like an opal list.
Sachee Perera | 47:12
Like that. It's like the next. You get on the next.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 47:15
You can get it in a very organized way and run it, and it'll have better clarity as well. The stages.
Because eventually we need to forecast, I need to forecast, right? So we need to do the forecast. I need to know the deal stages how much wetage you are going to give to each of the deal stages.
Sachee Perera | 47:30
Is always right that you're going to do each of these types of stages, person 20, maybe six weeks to close the step.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 47:34
It's 10% 20. If it is six weeks to close, it's 10% qualifies for the next lead toward Sen.
Sachee Perera | 47:37
Person.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 47:40
So those things have to come in, but I think we'll get there. But there's a lot of moving parts. Just standard startup things.
Sachee Perera | 47:50
Cool. Awesome, man. That's exactly what I wanted to get an idea of. So you're putting those accounts into lists and then you're managing where those accounts are up until the real deal, and then you create a deal, is that right?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 48:08
Yup yeah, create a deal. So recently, I have redone that with the current group, so we didn't have this going through.
Okay, it's been... another... yeah, there, current group, so current group we do have created that deal.
Sachee Perera | 48:23
The time the continued m know we can the cs and everything the systema by data front ta check so data and from point that s.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 48:28
Okay, I know we can put the SKUs and everything in the system and manage it from there. First Frontier...
So create a simple deal. We'll find the details, and it's tagged back to the account. All of this is there, but again, I feel that it'll... I'll dig in a little deeper. But the deal movements and all of those... If you want to... The deal stage is that you can normally see in Salesforce, and then you can see it go through Chevron's one, two, three words moving around.
Sachee Perera | 48:50
Those if you want to read on the statement and you can see it same four seven you can see it in gors 123 parts more like that.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 48:58
We pull it.
So that's probably there. So this is how it's kept simple, we keep adding the notes here.
Sachee Perera | 49:00
So this is not skeptical. It's audio and the say so we can look some someone yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 49:05
Bonni has access, I have access to it. Everything is maintained here. Bonnie has the sales navigator from a SAC.
That's the marketing use to send it to everywhere. Anyway, traditionally we haven't seen any of this marketing. I haven't seen it, not main met response anyway. From there, what I stopped in the last three or four weeks is sending out the mass emails sequencing. There was no response from there on the first.
And I said, "Okay, stop whenever you're sending all of those down there when you hit this list. Where I'm going with this is in the next two weeks I should have around 300 accounts, which KA is working with Yellow Pages, they should have around 50 accounts that I'm highly working with.
Sachee Perera | 49:33
You know I want to step there I that's explain why that's and you switch that's working with you.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 49:49
And I can probably give that one two options so I can get to the marketing and see if what they can do from the marketing side to come in front of them in terms of advertising anything what you're doing from my end, I can do the behind the scenes, I can do the sequencing and all those.
Just creating that momentum on top of what we are doing over here. Or they can try with a look-alike audience.
Sachee Perera | 50:10
Nine.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 50:12
But there's a lot of information in that Melbourne Yellow pages. We didn't have any of those. I have zero. When I came in, all I know is that there are a list of peoples which the agencies run in. So I needed to know what's going on, what is working, what's not working.
Sachee Perera | 50:26
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 50:27
At least for now.
I know if you stick to the ICP for these two modules, they are responding the kind of conversions. Everything is totally off the chart when we look for the industry thing. But as we build the momentum, the more we get in, the more we can start bringing...
Why I feel that reasoning is it took around two months probably to get another meeting booked with Land Engineering when we lost one of them.
So that is coming from an older list. I already told Bonnie that the list is gone, it means it's not gone. We have done something that's not worked. We put it up after the site we work, we come back.
We learned something from here. New scripts, new ways to hook the customer in. We have new materials in. Then you can go back and work with him and talk to him.
But don't blindly send emails and everything and not getting any response and they just blocking you out. So that's what is going on. You might have seen sales... like the marketing materials that probably need a bit of a little bit of work through one pages to all of this that means we may need a little bit of a revamp.
But yeah, this is where I'm at. If you need more, definitely happy to help you with it. But roses, like you said, they're coming in place.
Sachee Perera | 51:46
Yeah, understood.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 51:48
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 51:48
No, Sandy, that's really good. Thank you. That's great context and exactly what I needed. Look, I'll come back to you if I have any more questions.
But it's good to know that you put those calls in the sales fold. I did think... and I only listened to a whole bunch of Covey calls, which were in the good calls list. Yeah, thanks. I'll go through them again.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 52:12
Don't go by the tag. It is something like, just before you are joining, Nisha said she wants to classify. I wouldn't say that like great calls or anything. I just put her at that point in time that looked a little better.
But you just have a visit over here. When I get meaningful calls, I'm putting it. I wanted everyone to listen to this. This is something we lost. I feel Ka could have done slightly better, but she did a good fight for it. This is like me seeing her from day one. She was literally getting like stamped over to getting aware where she's pushing through. I can see her. She'll be able to get to qualify, not just "Can I have a demo?" We're just showing this. You only had to come now she can quantify things.
Okay? You guys don't have... You guys are close. Maybe I have a solution. Why don't you come to a demo? This can change you. So I can see she's coming here, but she's just ramping in another three months, and she'll be probably at a good velocity going with this.
I'll have a listen to this. I just... Calling? Very recently. But you can call probably mine too. I think all these ones you see over here are mine. The ones you see are mine. You'll be able to see that. Yeah.
