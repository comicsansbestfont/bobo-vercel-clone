# Session Notes: September 29, 2025

**Session Type:** Strategic Discussion
**Duration:** ~57 minutes
**Attendees:** Sachee Perera, Boney Mylady

---

## Focus
Board concerns about engagement continuation, pricing strategy, funding/equity structure

## Key Discussion Points

1. **Positive Sales Traction** - Megan (MJJ) said yes to trial with clear implementation plan agreed

2. **Board Concerns** - Board losing confidence after agency (8 demos, no conversions) and Sandy underperformance; viewing GTM90 as not delivering expected results

3. **Engagement Structure Discussion** - Boney presented board feedback requesting clear operations plan, performance-based remuneration, and accountability framework before Option 3 can proceed

4. **Funding Complexity** - Previous investors invested at 3M and 8M valuations (priced rounds), current situation estimates 5.2M using scorecard/future money methods, creating potential dilution issues

5. **Alternative SDR Resource** - Exploring re-engaging Harry Constant (agency cold caller from earlier engagement) now that positioning/messaging is clearer

- Continue running Facebook ads for another $200 (~20 days at $10/day)
