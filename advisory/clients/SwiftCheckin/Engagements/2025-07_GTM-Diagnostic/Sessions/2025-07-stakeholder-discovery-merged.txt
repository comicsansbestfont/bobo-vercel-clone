===== Start of Boney (swift checkin) Meeting 7 - Kickoff Meeting (11th July 2025).txt =====

Sachee Perera | 00:35
Hello, good afternoon, how are you guys?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 00:38
Good afternoon.
Sachee Perera | 00:46
Are you all ready? Are you all packed and ready to go, bunny?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 00:51
No, I usually take only my laptop and just one pair of strass, that's it.
[Laughter] I traveled, yeah, I'm a fan of traveling like that, so yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:09
Okay, very good. How are you? [Laughter] Yeah, I'm terrible.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 01:13
I'm good actually. Yeah, and backing Bo, this conversation. Traveling light is really hard for me, to be honest. Yes.
Sachee Perera | 01:25
Sometimes I travel really light and I don't pack enough and I take a very small bag. Sometimes I don't know if I'm coming to Sydney or somewhere cold. I pack all my jumpers because in my head, it's like freezing,
but when I go somewhere warm, I take maybe two pairs of shorts and a couple of shirts. That's it, [Laughter].
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:49
Yeah, as we always have, there's an argument regarding that you should travel light. I used to say you should love light, and Nai said, "Nah, you should be enough to cover everything.
Sachee Perera | 02:04
Yeah, very good.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 02:05
[Laughter].
Sachee Perera | 02:09
Awesome. Guys, I'm excited to kick off today and get started. I'm still yet to send you the mutual NDA. I have a one-way NDA, but I know I have a mutual two-way NDA, which I'll try to find and send through today, if that's Y.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 02:31
Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, I'll wait for it. Alright. So what I'm going to do is this session. What I'm planning to do is I'll give you an idea of how the product has evolved so far.
So that you'll get an understanding of what happened then, how the sales and marketing team came into place. And then finally, I will go through the results. So how many customers were given the demo to, and whether they have gone forward with us or not, all those things will be discussed during this meeting.
I think that's pretty much going to consume the whole one hour for today. So the reason why I thought I would start with the product evolution is so that you'll get a better understanding of when we pivoted and why we pivoted.
We did do pivots so far and why we did it. Maybe then you will get an understanding of whether it might be a quick one or whether it might be a reasonable one. All those things you can read through when I tell the story.
If you've got any questions, meanwhile, just feel free to raise them at that point of time. Okay, so we started this in 2023. At that time, I had a co-founder. He came up with a problem in your Southwar, managing their contractors' movements across multiple TAFEs.
So that's where St. Chicken has been started.
Sachee Perera | 04:30
H.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 04:30
All right. So they had five campuses. And the contractors worked throughout the day and night in these campuses. And they have no idea what time they started or what time they went off. They used the old good old pen and paper, write it down.
That's how they were managing this. Then, in one of their cleaning contracts, they found out, with the help of eight facility coordinators, there was a mismatch between the number of hours and the number of people they had contacted versus the actual ones.
So they did an audit for three months, and they found out a huge discrepancy. That's why that company had to refer 1.3 million back to TAFE. So that's when Sen was bored. Okay, then as the first round, we... We sold our house and opened an office in India. I started calling by myself initially as my project, and then gradually I started giving these things to the team in India.
Now, by November 2023, what they've told us was to give us a proof of concept. So they're going to pay us for that, and we have provided the quotation. Then they'll get into the mental list, and then from there, they can expand that to multiple cameras across New South Wales.
After five to six months, we have catered for three to four months of development to do this project. During this time, we will keep on updating these things. But we didn't get a purchase order because it was taking a bit long to get into the mental list.
So we kept on doing the paperwork and discussions. We're going on all those things. Meanwhile, I took my trust part and then went forward with the development. That's when we started developing this.
After developing a significant amount, maybe three to four months of development with a small team, when we started contacting them back, there were two: there was a regional head and another person, the facility head of these three or four campuses. They got transferred. The position has been transferred.
We couldn't go further with that conversation. Then we had the first pivot. We thought, okay, where is the next best place we can put this software? That's when we started the auto integration.
Our software was much stronger. Our software is much stronger. Radio was the time sheets. So we thought, okay, we will go integrate with Autodesk. Then the time sheet spot can be done with a small team. We started integrating that. We thought we had a person in internal contact with others at USK. He referred us to a couple of people in US, and then we got into that integration partnership program and started integrating that. That's what happened. It took us probably... We thought that it's going to finish in three months, but it took us more than that.
Then finally we completed the Auto skin integration. By that time, Koor had left the company as he couldn't see the result and it was taking too much time for all the things. So he was like a part-time after that commitment.
Then we tried to raise friends and family around and keep trying for some more time at the Auto client. Then we did our first event conducted along with one of the Auto resellers, and we got only one lead that got up to the most stage. That was not a... It was a very niche event.
But again, looking back, that was a failure as well. Okay, then we started those... One successfully went with that for a couple of months. The sales cycle of Auto clients was too high, which I don't think the startup can wait for that long.
That's when we hired a person in for marketing and tried to raise funds. Continued raising funds through friends and families so that we can hire a person in sales. At the same time, I have gotten and interviewed more contractors and owners in the construction industry to understand the process and start expanding the product with friends and family around then.
Sachee Perera | 10:20
At the same time, we closed contracts in the construction and infrastructure and understand across.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 10:32
Now by 2024, we hired an external sales agency
to run the calling and emailing while we are doing these developments in scheduling and expanding the time sheets. All those things that you have seen so far.
Sachee Perera | 10:47
See. Seems to decide to other day to go.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 10:50
We started doing all those things. Hired a consultant, which is what I shared with you the other day regarding the consultant thing.
So to go after bigger companies. So to high-value tickets where he can go into... And then a Coman group that was an informed lead that came in. I will speak more about all the clients during the end of this session and on February five.
Sachee Perera | 11:20
25.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 11:20
You've probably failed MR with sales agency and consultancy experiment started looking for sales calls for.
Sachee Perera | 11:25
Start looking for sales. I think that's.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 11:27
I think that's when we started meeting Yochi. Then April. Yeah, April, Sandy and discover the Appointment Cetera joined, and then the condom writer joined us. Well, initially we didn't have any system for sales.
So we started putting the CRM dial pad and all those things in place, and then we started making those scores and core emails and all the marketing campaigns. St at Kickov and June 2025. Full operations for full operation solutions for say trades have been changed to concentrate only on construction time sheet and scheduling.
Sachee Perera | 12:21
Scheduling because we saing is not very conc.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 12:21
Because we understood that somewhere that messaging is not going really well. And now we are doing the core courses and then this landing page experiments, that's what we are doing right now. So bit of what we do for sales.
So before that, did you get any cost sales? So you can see that we have pre-bugged two times. And why are you happy with that?
Sachee Perera | 12:53
Yeah, no, that's a good, concise overview.
I will have some questions, but let's finish this first. And I'll come back to.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 13:07
Okay. Right now, regarding the sales effort that we are doing right now is we got an appointment set up who is doing the landing pages calls and Apollo lead calls. Okay. So that's what the appointment center is doing, sales manager is doing. He's much more doing the account-based marketing.
So he's finding out the buyer, who is researching, scheduling, and time sheets in the construction industry within the construction industry and visitors.
Sachee Perera | 13:49
In the industry. In the construction industries. And the visitors really is coming to.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 13:53
Who is coming to our website? Who belongs to the construction or wider construction? UMBLA marketing?
Sachee Perera | 14:02
Marketing.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 14:02
We are doing this landing page experiments.
Sachee Perera | 14:03
We are doing this expely in the future videos.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 14:06
And then they started creating the feature-related videos blocks that we are doing three per week LinkedIn posts and daily for Bony and SSE and.
Sachee Perera | 14:12
Things I've been doing to design.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 14:23
And then I think we started with the Google ads as well.
Sachee Perera | 14:30
Okay, alright, so that's all pretty new.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 14:30
And Ready Tats.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 14:32
Yeah. Google Ads and Ready Tats are the play ads that we are doing.
Sachee Perera | 14:44
If I can go back to your. So you started off as a contractor management solution for TAFE specifically. And was that specifically geared towards cleaners or any like when you did that trial or that when you find that 1.3 million dollar discrepancy was that specifically from a cleaning company or did was it kind of you PO contract.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 14:55
Yes.
It was for the full TA of all the contractors. But this 1.3 million thing was specifically for the cleaners. So the proposal there would... Okay. The discussion that we had was the proof of concept is going to be deployed across all the cleaners in five canvases in SNY.
Sachee Perera | 15:31
The discussion as to consent is going to be redeployed because all the CS in Right could you have...
So I'm. I'm just testing here. So you tried Tafe? Were there other similar businesses you could approach with that same story? "Hey, we found a 1.3 in the schooling or other TAFs or other universities and things. Or was that too hard?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 16:08
No, look, we one looking back, we should have done that, but we haven't done any of those things.
One reason that I can think of is we thought that would be a very smooth process because the problem was very clear there. It took them three months of eight employees consecutively tracking their time.
So they write it down separately on each shift and track down this. I believe sixty cleaning staff across these campuses consolidated everything.
Sachee Perera | 16:53
Yeah, th this is exactly what core plan did for drilling contractors.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 16:54
That's how they got this money Back.
Sachee Perera | 17:03
It was the invoiced versus actual, so that's a very big problem, right?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 17:08
No.
Sachee Perera | 17:11
For the client.
So the tafe and the contractor. So. So which is interesting. And now you've, you pivoted to construction, the construction industry. And now what made you prefer to the construction industry specifically like in November.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 17:34
Okay, alright, so at that point... Okay, I'll tell you two sides of the story. At that point, we were desperate to have some client.
The co-founder we had at that time, he had... So he'd been presenting this to you, and you've been talking to different people about this.
Sachee Perera | 18:04
You can like more presents then and I was wondering I wanted us to of how is common for off and.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 18:10
And there was one guy in Auto who is a friend of a common friend of ours.
Then he told me that, "Okay, we are looking for... I've been getting a lot of requests from companies, which is similar to your platform, which AutoDesk didn't have. So do you want to solve that part? Then it's going to be a good idea that you can do that.
Sachee Perera | 18:37
Understood okay that makes sense alright cool. And so since Novemb so that's from November twenty twenty three and you were focusing on trades since then. Time sheets and yep, I like.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 18:50
Look, yes, we are specifically looking for time sheets and integrating those time sheets to our platform.
Sachee Perera | 19:01
Okay, yeah.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 19:01
And our Water didn't have the time sheet, and then we put that time sheet part and integrated their main part,
the cost management side and the project management side. They have been integrated.
Sachee Perera | 19:12
The management side to.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 19:16
And we have to do a bit of tweaking to change the product in a way so that it's going to align with the Autodesk management side our Water didn't have the time sheet, and then we put that time sheet part and integrated their main part, the cost management side and the project management side. They have been management side we have to do a bit of tweaking to change the product in a way so that it's going to align with the Autodesk CAS.
Sorry, we put forward this cost management, the budgeting side and the project scheduling side, and then integrated those parts and gave back the time sheet data to Autodesk as part of the performance tracking or in their BFOR.
Sachee Perera | 19:57
Cool. So a lot of those workflows that you have came from the Autodesk integration work and the requirements from... Is that right? Then what about.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 20:10
It's a bit of both. So, yeah, for some of them, the compliance-related things, all those things came from TAF because all those things were their requirement.
Sachee Perera | 20:12
Okay. That its claims it some more than 16. Which is to jos all thes.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 20:25
We already had jobs and job related things which are related to Auto Desk sorry, which is related to TA as well, because the plan was to sing all the jobs from their platform to us and then from here to manage the contractor movements.
And that's what the plans with the tape was. The cost management side came from specifically the budget side, and it came from the Autodesk integration.
Sachee Perera | 20:55
Okay, cool, good. That I was wondering how. Yeah, because your software had, like, lots of different things, parts of the webflow, so I was curious to see how did you come across building those?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 21:06
Y.
Sachee Perera | 21:14
That gives me more Clarity.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 21:17
Yeah, because I just want to give this clarity to you so that you will get when we go to that GTM or when we do the when we do the audit of the GDM that we are doing right now.
Sachee Perera | 21:18
Yeah.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 21:33
So you will have a better understanding of it. Okay, whether this aligns more with this group or the other group or whatever the way that we should go forward with then, yeah, sorry, keep going and asking a question, yes.
Sachee Perera | 21:43
Yes.
No. I think those were the key questions. I have some based on the very last things that you covered around the most recent experiments and stuff.
But if you have other things to mention, that would be good.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 22:17
Yeah, then the okay, that's so well spoken a little bit about that pivot. So pivot two was more in July. We went for a combined event. It was more for airport and airport-related contractors.
Okay. So how we ended up there was we got a connection through LinkedIn who was an Autodesk reseller, and that reseller told us, "We are going into an event as you start, and we can go for a very discounted price for these events."
Then we joined. It was our first event as well. We were not sure how the event was going to go, and we conducted it together as part of this, but unfortunately, there was only one lead that came that.
Sachee Perera | 23:17
Trans lead.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 23:27
So there were two leads, one, but only one that even went into a demo change and all those things.
Sachee Perera | 23:39
So why are you calling this pivot? Why would.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 23:42
No, this is not a payer. I'm giving a background of how we did that in September. We when we were.
Sachee Perera | 23:50
I'm the.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 23:52
So when we gone into that, the more understood what their things are.
Sachee Perera | 23:52
So. I need to. That the more.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 23:58
And then we realized that the sales cycle of Autodesk is too long. So it's typically six months to two years. That's what the sales cycle is from the initial discussion. Then I'll just go in and interview more contractors and owners in the construction industry to understand the process and start expanding the product with friends and family around.
So then we decided that, okay, we will better go with small to medium businesses within the construction industry where we can make use of these.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 24:35
I'm sorry to interrupt. I'm sorry, but I'm... For example, just during the airport, we came to know that if only this Auto... So it was an India-based company, and they were actually trying to integrate with Auto, trying to buy Auto, and they were actually having multiple discussions.
Then we understood that it's going to take nearly six months to one year to convert the Interter company to accept the Auto. So our chance is very less. For example, then we understood that if we are going with just... If we're just only focusing on Auto clients, then the Auto platform has to be accepted first.
Then we have to... But we were thinking the other way because what we were told was there were many subcontractors who are currently using Autodesk wanted timesheets. And so that was... And then they're really desperate in doing that.
So that's what the information we got from the Auto and Auto representative. And that's why the integration happened so quickly because they said the timesheet part is so important. And we are considered, as you know, a valuable decoration by Auto as well, because they don't have a Timesheet part.
But later we understood that even though we got a Timesheet, Auto clients are using the Auto platform in a different way. Each client has got different Timesheet requirements as well.
So if we have got one, it doesn't fit into all of them as well.
We had a few companies that came.
So they wanted... Some wanted just the very basic Timesheet, while a few wanted the extra deputies and things like that.
So we were like, "Okay, this is not a standard Timesheet for Auto." Then we understood the fact that it's not going to work. Then we had to be independent. We have to do an independent solution.
When we talk to the INT to fit out company as part of the Auto discussion, we came to know that clients are actually facing issues by using multiple platforms. So even if they are buying Auto, they have to pay for apps on top of it, they have to pay for pros on top of it, and they have to pay for us ORS on top of it.
Sachee Perera | 26:51
Yes.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 26:51
So we thought there was a value there, and that's why we have right now what we have. We'll try to give it as a complete solution. That's what we thought. So that we will enter the market as an independent solution so that people don't have to use multiple solutions, but just one solution on a platform.
So that's why we called it a second pivot. Even though we have got pillars of many modules. For example, we've got Timesheets and scheduling, which is actually complete for us, but other things are actually the pillars, the budget and things like that. We are actually building small by small.
And then yeah, that's all it is up to. Thank you, Bonnie, thanks for letting me speak.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 27:36
Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, I think you explained it, but he was very good. Yeah, so that's why we called it the second payor.
Sachee Perera | 27:42
Yeah, okay, that makes sense. Understood.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 27:47
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 27:48
Okay, pivot one was, okay, let's focus on the construction industry using AutoDesk as a go-to-market partner for distribution.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 27:48
So? Yeah, that makes sense. The second period.
Sachee Perera | 28:01
We get Autodesk, and they help distribute us.
Then pivot two was no, okay, the Autodesk clients are not a fit because they're all... Yeah, okay. Then you decided to go fully so SMB and SME, so is the Autodesk integration still live and working.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 28:20
It is, yes.
Sachee Perera | 28:20
And that partnership is still active. Okay. Is There.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 28:24
And we got this. It's a good thing to bring it up last week or the week before. A big company from the US, I think they got 8,500 employees across the world worldwide. They came through what USI, but since then we've been trying to get in touch with that person. She's based in Texas, I believe, but it didn't go any further.
Sachee Perera | 28:55
Sure.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 28:56
They are not even responding.
So we just want to know what the requirement is.
Sachee Perera | 29:04
Yes.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 29:04
We couldn't even... So Jeremy is our AutoDesk contact, and he forwarded that to us. Okay, this is what it is, and then it didn't go.
Sachee Perera | 29:20
Okay.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 29:20
So we've got apps too. Has got the marketplace and they have got an app store as well. And our app is actually highlighted there. We came to know that the lead actually has seen the app and then conducted the partnership. The auditors partnership member contacted us like that's how it happened.
But there was no further step proceeded based on that.
Sachee Perera | 29:43
Cool, okay, very good. It's good to know that the relationship is still active, so should that be something that we can reactivate or focus on? All right, so September 24th. We interviewed a whole bunch of customers. We decided to go with S&B and SME. What's the pipeline looking like right now in terms of total commerce? Your ha.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 30:15
Okay, alright. Due to this effort, the sales agency effort, we got a few in. Of course, it was a December time as well, but we got one client out of it which I went and met in person to understand what he is doing, how much, what are the things that we can migrate fully to this full business solution as we proposed. He's currently using one software for timesheet, the other one for cost management, some Excel sheets for project management, and then the calendar. The calendar?
Sachee Perera | 31:04
So who did that? The Customer.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 31:07
It is from a landscape landscaping company.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 31:14
Zealand Zealand Engineering as landscaping, I believe, yeah, as New Zealand landscaping, and they are doing the landscaping for councils.
Sachee Perera | 31:16
Ostland.
Yeah. And sorry, I may have forgotten this, but is that one of the two trials or is this just before.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 31:35
Before that, this is the one that has got that progress claim.
Sachee Perera | 31:36
Okay. So this is.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 31:40
So he finally told us that. Okay, we later. So we I liked your product, but if they can't do the progress claim, we're not going to migrate, okay?
It's more like a migration. Okay.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 32:01
So yeah, so with the sales activity external agency calling, so this client actually reached out to us, not reached out to us. The demo was supposed to be given around December timeframe, but during the holidays it was actually shifted across to nearly five months.
Then Bonnie had a series of talks. Then we came to know that he's using Deputy, he's using Workbench, he's using Excel, Shapes, and he's using two other things. Then we said, "Okay, we can actually manage a few of it, but with the pro because we are lacking progress claims and it is actually itself a big entity." We thought, "No, we are not going to develop any further." We'll concentrate on sales and marketing with what we have currently.
So it is actually in whole... We can still proceed if you get a progress claim with us, but it's just still on hold. So that's the first one based on the delete that is based on it. This is apart from what we have like the two talking clients that we have got right now.
Sachee Perera | 33:00
Okay. And so the sales agency that you engaged. When you said an agency and a consultant, are these two different?
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 33:12
Yes, they are two different actually. So, because we were pretty... Not sure. Like if you're hiring someone like how it is... And then we thought we need someone experienced but not to fit in within our budget.
We thought to experiment to do experiments at a time. So we have hired a sales consultant, just to help with the enterprise clients because we need to know the product market fit at that time.
So where our solutions fit in, whether the enterprise solutions are actually enterprise companies are actually happy to accept us or whether small and medium builders are actually going to get more worthy of a solution.
So we just need to see which one is actually doing better. So that's the reason why we have hired both of them. And then the sales consultant were initially actually talking to like many enterprise clients.
But he didn't that that's what the conversation we had the other day. He didn't do his part. He said he seemed like he's doing many things, but, I don't know, we trusted that it didn't go as it was supposed to be.
And on the other hand, with the agencies, they TED to do call calling only based on the time sheets. We had few demos. We had few demos, but. Sorry. We have few, bookings, but most of them were actually no shows.
And then we found, like the collaboration with the external agencies, like, really ineffective, just based on the fact that, the appointments are not, like, not currently set. The meeting links were not, you know, sent. We were not informed even though they said like they have booked. It was not actually seen in our calendar.
So it was like it wasn't actually really going well. So we thought like we would definitely need an internal person to consolidate and to move it forward. Yes. And but the other fact is that the external agency told that the time sheet party is actually gaining momentum even though it was like a December no, but December time with so many absentee or leaves and so those things like those things but so that gave us the conference like.
Okay. If you're having, you know, the if you're having the internal team, then we will be able to have, you know, more demos or more, conversions if we build our own teams. So that's the reason why we put a stop to both of them on FB in Feb.
So it was only that experiments went only like nearly three months like three to four months. I would say, yeah, so that yeah, that is up to effect.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 35:50
2020 5-3 months. I would say, and just to add what Nisha said, the consultant was given the task of seeing whether the contractor management is going to be helpful for similar to the question that you have asked if it's a big, medium, or big enterprise, if this contractor management thing is going to work for them or not.
So that's why the assignment was given to the consultant, and for the salesperson. So the sales agency was more for the construction time sheet. We were in a position where we had to decide: which one should we go forward with, this one or the other one?
That's when we hired two different people, and it was only very limited hours, I would say, but we just wanted to try and see how that was going to go.
Sachee Perera | 36:53
Okay, and now you have Sandy and Kabita, they're both your internal staff members. They're not from an agency, right?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 37:04
Yes, they both are currently in India.
Sachee Perera | 37:05
Okay. And Kabita is in India. Or.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 37:11
But Sandy was in Australia from 2015 onwards for the last ten years. For the last two or three months, he is in India. And I was calling to... She was working for Water for New Zealand, calling to New Zealand customers.
Sachee Perera | 37:36
And a content writer as well.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 37:40
Yeah, he's... So there is currently only me, Nisha, and Sandy, who is from the Australian background. Most of the people are from India.
Sachee Perera | 37:56
2.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 37:56
Yeah, can I take over, Bonnie? Is that alright? Hello, is that okay? Yeah, I got it. I jotted a few things in here so I thought it'd be easy if I explained. So regarding the team, I would say we got CEOs, Bonnie and no co-founders as such, as we said the co-founder who has slept.
Then we got a CFO, his name is Jubish, and he's actually in Australia. He's currently in Australia. He's a part of the team and works part-time, not full, but just advisory and part-time.
We got a sales manager. We got Sandy, as Bonnie said, he's from... He was in Australia and then currently he's in India. We got a marketing manager as well. He's based in Bangalore. I'm not sure whether he's from Bangalore and he's based in India as well. He's actually working on all the things from India.
With the office, we've got two offices. One is in Australia, that's in Sydney, and then India. So that is in Kerala. I'm not sure whether you are aware of Kerala. So that is in the southern state of India. That's where we hail from.
So we got a physical office in India as well. Then we got the product engineering team. All the product engineering teams are actually under Bonnie. And then consulted by Bonnie, not a consultant. Bonnie is actually taking care of all the product engineering teams and everything.
So they're actually in the Indian office. I'm right now along with them. Then we got the front and we got the backend. We got the content writer, he's actually working from home in India itself.
We got the support staff as well, and then productive. So that's what regarding the team. With the tools that we use right now for the collaboration, we use Zoho for the Indian team and for the Australian team, who works? We use MS Office, and then we got the other collaboration tools, Jira for the product development.
So just the product development team uses Jira, and then all other products are as we know, the CRMs. We got HubSpot, we got the dialer, and then we use this other software like fewer software to coordinate everything.
Sachee Perera | 40:19
Okay, very good. So there is... And how big is your product and engineering team?
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 40:27
So we got four frontend and developers, including the team lead as well. We got four backend developers, including the team lead as well. We got one content writer.
And we got one support. Yeah, we got one content writer and this front-end team, they are good in like, you know, designing as well. So they do the designing part as well.
Sachee Perera | 40:46
Okay, and some of the work so going back, thanks for that Intel.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 40:47
So do they do all the marketing material?
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 40:50
Yes. No, it's like they so whenever we require, they come to the marketing team. Sorry, marketing sprints. And then yeah, that's how we work.
Sachee Perera | 41:06
It's good to get a lay of the land. So there's... So since you did since April, you've had internal sales activity happening.
And then prior to that, you had the external agency as well. Was the external agency using HubSpot and your dial pad and all those systems or a black hole?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 41:29
No, yeah, it's a big black hole. That's where the temp mistake that we have done because that's when we... It's not because we didn't even though we got really very little demos.
Sachee Perera | 41:37
Okay.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 41:47
The other reason was we are not getting clarified on what are the rejection messages that we are getting. They are getting whether they need it or they don't need it, whether they're using a competitor or not a competitor.
Sachee Perera | 41:57
Okay.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 42:05
All those messages were not communicated back to us.
Sachee Perera | 42:10
No.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 42:11
All we usually get as a report is this is, we have conducted X number of companies through email and X number of through phone. This is the conversion rate. This is what.
Sachee Perera | 42:27
Yeah, it's a bit useless because you don't know if they're actually calling or not.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 42:35
Absolutely that. But we see it as a good thing because that's where we've gone and found HubSpot, a dial pad, all those things that we put in place so that the team.
Sachee Perera | 42:42
Yeah.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 42:51
That's the first thing that Sandy did when he came in. When I talked to him about all these problems, he went and did this CRM thing, had a dial pad thing, and we got all the calls being recorded through our system.
Sachee Perera | 43:09
Okay, so I have two questions.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 43:09
So.
Sachee Perera | 43:13
The first question is: you've gone through the full journey, right? You've spent your last night writing this out. Both of you have probably been talking about this while going through this whole journey so far.
What are the things that you can see right now? What bubbled up into your head? Any new findings or new revelations that popped up that you're excited about, or concerns or questions?
What has come to your mind since writing this down, and even at this very point in our conversation today? What's the most obvious thing that you Fe.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 43:55
You go.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 43:56
Fa [Laughter] Okay, so to answer that question, we always review ourselves. We always see where we are up to. So, I'm really open to say that we really understood what our limitations are, but we want to go forward, and we really pushed all the time.
So, going back, we criticize a lot ourselves, each other, and as a business as well most of the time. We thought we would have actually gone as an independent simple check-in and check-out solution immediately after tape. That was the first thing that we could have done.
But we were not sure that itself had actually the potential to itself had to actually gone. So that's a thing that we're thinking about it. It would have done that. But we never regret it on that because we believe in our vision, and we want to expand as a company. We learn from our mistakes.
The main thing that keeps us motivated is that we never gave up. We just pushed ourselves. We try to find the right people all the time. We try to seek things, and we wish we wanted to get there.
So that's the main thing. That's it. Then, thank God we are getting. We believe that we are getting the right people, all right? People when the time is required. Then this many, so going through all this, sometimes I think, "My God, should we have gone this way?"
But it's okay, that's how we learn.
Sachee Perera | 45:49
H yeah.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 45:50
And yeah, that's how we go. That's how we go. Yeah, I think that that's it. I don't know whether I... So the question is, whether you meant to get an answer like that or not, I'm not sure what you mean, but yeah, this is what the ultimate feeling after writing or after going through this journey.
Sachee Perera | 46:07
Cool. Thank you, Nisha. That's helpful and Bo.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 46:08
Yeah.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 46:14
So regarding the.
Sachee Perera | 46:24
A cliffhanger. [Laughter] I think he dropped out.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 46:33
Get 20, [Laughter] sorry, I'm missing you all in between, so I was asking such a question, I will ask a question back.
Sachee Perera | 46:36
The suspense is killing me. [Laughter].
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 46:47
So what do you want to hear? Okay, looking back, what are the stupid things that we had done?
Sachee Perera | 46:55
But not so much the stupid things. I find going through and explaining, being on the other side, during those conversations, I would have had these really good ideas or not ideas.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 46:56
He said.
Sachee Perera | 47:10
Key epiphanies that pop into my head.
Like. This is what I should tell the other person. But sometimes because I don't want to.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 47:20
[Laughter] No, we don't do that. Said I will be... I will be very open with you in terms of things that we have done. So first thing I would say is let me do with the knowledge that I have right now if I reset everything and start today, I would have gone with the very first thing that we have done, which is with the TAF and the question that you have asked.
Sachee Perera | 47:42
Yp.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 47:55
Okay. Did you go and find out another TAF? TAF who and all of them said no to you? Is that... Did you try in that way? But somewhere on those two pivots, I still feel that we pivoted too early or we gave up too early.
That's what I think. Maybe it's our own limiting belief that has contributed to that. Okay, just for check-in and check-out. There won't be any use case at all. But then later we realized that Honeywell is doing only with that check-in and check-out. Honeywell is doing very good. There's a signsign.com product that Honeywell has acquired from a small startup.
So that's one thing that I would say. The other good part that we're seeing is somewhere we are getting the right people at the right time. God, Universe, whatever that you call it, is giving us the right people at the right times to take us to where our ultimate goal that we have set for is.
Sachee Perera | 49:20
Yes.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 49:22
So somewhere it's guiding us to that part. That's what we feel.
Sachee Perera | 49:27
Okay, that's good. Look, it's important to review and retro and really challenge yourself and contest your assumptions and then force justification against the principles that we have.
I think that's important. So, look, I'm glad to hear those answers, so thank you. I know it's not easy, especially when someone drops a question like that to you. My next question is now that from April.
So that April, June, halfway through July. Sandy's been on the phone talking to your enterprise customers. Keit has been writing appointments, doing appointments, and then you're just doing some landing page experiments. What are the biggest learnings so far that you feel?
Yeah. What are the biggest learnings in the last three months on that market?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 50:20
So pretty much mid of April, that's when Sandy started. Keit started a week or two weeks ago, early April, but it was after Sandy came in. He bought all these dial pads and all those software in place, which took us close to two or three weeks to get the dial pads sorted out. We were trying out two or three different software. TED Dial Pad started making the calls from 19th of May, and that's when we actively started making those calls from that point. I believe we
let me bring that thing up.
Sachee Perera | 51:07
Capita.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 51:09
I will share this detailed thing with you, correct?
Sachee Perera | 51:15
Yeah. I'll be going into those calls and reviewing them. Like the as crossing that C.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 51:21
Correct. But I just want to give you an overview, okay? This is the last campaign that we have done against project tech means. Perth, Melbourne, Sydney were the three areas that we tried.
So we had 100 to 235 accounts altogether. 801 contacts were they? So this is where it's all sitting IBR or not connected. Gatekeeper. Rejected. At this, this is what the status is, and I will give you the... I will share this Excel sheet with you and then you can go into detail.
So we are since May, we are recording how many calls that you have made, how many of them canceled, what's the average call duration, what's a positive sentiment, negative sentiment. And then all the notes have been written over here of what our biggest learning thing is that we have done in these cases. We thought that we can give it as a full solution.
But then people are more responding to one specific area within our software, like if you tell TimeSheet about only time sheets. Then they started listening to it. So for the first two to three weeks of calls, we decided from mid-June, from 19th of May to 5th of June.
Sachee Perera | 53:00
As plenty of messages with the students in that complete with solution for the trans.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 53:05
We will keep telling that it is a complete business solution for trades within the construction industry.
But now we are talking only about time sheets and scheduling, and all the landing pages are related to either time sheets or scheduling with different sets of pain points. Within time sheets, there will be two different pain points. Within scheduling, there will be three different pain points, and we are putting these pain points as an ad in REIT and then diverting those customers back to our platform so that.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 53:51
It's majorly like the website. SAS is a complete solution. But when we do the campaigns in marketing and sales, all the core coding scripts, everything is based on time sheets and scheduling.
Sachee Perera | 53:59
En is based on territory sexually emas are reach.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 54:02
Emails are based on time sheets and scheduling, and we are ready, TED?
Sachee Perera | 54:05
The second thing is just to explain some qualities and not like [Laughter] a construction management construction site management doesn't say that.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 54:06
Google everything is just explains all those not as like a contractor management, not like a construction management or construction site management. It doesn't say that, it just says timesheets.
Sal and all the campaigns and all the sales and marketing efforts are based on that.
But the website says it is a complete solution. So those who come to the website, they got everything in there. Then we got the LA landing MIS we are creating as well, just for time sheet scheduling and based when we do the other ones, we will do the other landing pages.
Sachee Perera | 54:34
Okay.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 54:35
The other mistake that we've done is we were even though we are tracking the website, we are not tracking the visitors who are coming to our website, which we started from June 22nd when we started with the time sheet and scheduling. From there, this is what the results are.
Sachee Perera | 54:43
Web cooperate your website to be done. So be starting with H.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 55:01
So on a daily basis we are getting around 121, this is the maximum. So somewhere around 56 visitors are coming to your website on a daily basis. This is time sheet. Landing page is getting 39, 37.98% and scheduling is getting 33.09% of the landing pages.
Sachee Perera | 55:25
Definitely.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 55:28
1.
here you can see the pain point scheduling last minute and scheduling allocation.
Sachee Perera | 55:36
Are you using something like Hotjar or PostHog on the Webb?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 55:42
We are using Clarity from Microsoft. Do I understand the user behaviors visit, visitor, website, visitor tracking we are doing?
Sachee Perera | 55:48
Yeah.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 55:52
We are trying out three different software. We got Analytics, Google Analytics, we got Fathom AI and then we got Instantly and Fathom AI is giving us much more clarity on what it is.
Sachee Perera | 56:07
So yeah, I would, like Google Analytics is good, but I would install post hog ABS factors before.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 56:10
And at the same time we are using HubSpot as well to try and find out the buyer and then visitor he.
Sachee Perera | 56:26
But post hog, it will. You'll be able to slice and dice it. It's like Google Analytics, but you'll get the... What do you call it? The on-page behavior. Where are people clicking and doing all of that? It's a little bit like Clarity, but I think it's a... Well, based on preference, PostHog is a little bit easier to use than Clarity as well.
But hey, it does the same thing. What's important is if it's resonating well, is the messaging resonating? What's... Are the other people clicking on the right things? Probably not really relevant right now, but as we scale, we'll want to look at those. Who's right marketing? Sorry, I didn't... But
Okay.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 57:22
His name is... He is the one who is based in India. I said like terminal seminars.
Sachee Perera | 57:26
And not the content writer. That's someone else, isn't it?
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 57:30
Yes. Yep. So he joined the organ. He joined us since August 24th. It is going to be a year. But I should say that we haven't been actually actively using Microsoft Clarity or all these things until Bonnie mentioned it on June 22nd because we were constantly revamping the website and doing some ads and then things like that.
So, yeah, that is a limitation. That's something we would have done that we were not aware of that we should have actually informed them. Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 58:12
That's cool. And in terms of what you mentioned, in those sales report master.el, you had a number of accounts and the number of accounts and contacts. Those are the number of accounts and contacts from that are already in CRM. Or is that okay?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 58:40
So what we are doing right now is for calling, we are keeping an Excel sheet only.
Sachee Perera | 58:43
We are giving an associ qualy if.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 58:46
If they are interested, that's when we get it entered into Terra. So if they are interested, they will get into CRM if they are not, they will keep those details in an Excel sheet.
But for Sandy, what he's doing is who are coming to our website within our CP? He's contacting directly them with through email and phone calls and who are showing a buyer intent. So we are tracking the buyer intent through HubSpot and then whoever searching for time sheets or scheduling within our ICP that we are. We put the hypothesis as he is contacting them as so.
Sachee Perera | 59:35
So you have Sandy's account list in HubSpot, and then the appointment setter account list is in an Excel sheet. Okay, list cool. And Kabita, Kabita right, Kabita is in Excel.
Alright, cool. And both of the calls and meetings are recorded in the dial pad or Fireflies or are they? You had to go into two separate things.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:00:14
Now got all the calls have been recorded in the dial pad meetings in the last one month.
Sachee Perera | 01:00:21
Yep.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:00:25
I believe we got only those two clients that we are talking about regarding that trial.
Sachee Perera | 01:00:37
Yeah. Okay.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:00:38
Okay. Now probably before that, I will take you down to the clients that we have discussed so far. Okay? July 2024 television shop fitters. They were a 14 million dollar company based on airport.
Sachee Perera | 01:00:55
So not tech?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:00:57
They were came through that event as part of what industry resellers, and we already spoken about why we didn't go forward with it.
So India fit out. There was another company that came in, but after initial conversation, they didn't even go further. Like they didn't even come for the demo. E Commarine Group. That's when they came through a website. The safety officer came through our website. They were specifically looking for the contractor management, sorry, contractor movement to be tracked and they are from a shipbuilding company based in Perth. Terra Firma.
Yeah. This is something that came through the call. They were calling that done by that external agency. But we, through the discovery call, understood that they were using sign-on-site. Then the project manager himself told us that we were not looking for something that would be changed any soon. Bryant Construction is something that I came through with the consultant person, and he wanted the reason that he didn't go for it. They didn't even come for an AA demo. The reason why they didn't come for the demo is what the consultant said: there is a transition happening from the business giving from one generation to the next generation.
Who are the technology consultants? That's been used by the dads. Dad, the son doesn't want to use any of them. That's the reason why they couldn't go further. Osland Group is the one that I was talking about, the progress claim, Aqua Metro, they again came through the Autless partnership. They are still open. They haven't gone further. The last conversation that I had was that
they got what they needed, which was the timesheet, and they were trialing the Autodesk. They came from Procore. They're going to Autodesk, and they're filing the Autodesk, but they're not getting a chance to completely try it out.
So the last conversation that I had was that they bought a one-year license from Autodesk. They're trying it on a small project, but this person needs too much depth into the timesheet part. Like after, they have to do the what is it, overtime then?
Sachee Perera | 01:04:03
To do the what is is.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:04:07
Overtime 1.5x, overtime 2x, Saturday, Sunday, all times. Then all those things were not ready on March 2025mmki.
Sachee Perera | 01:04:21
Yeah, so just coming back to Aqua Metro, why did they want to leave Procore? Why did they.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:04:23
Yeah. Electric again. They K sorry.
Sachee Perera | 01:04:32
Yeah. If, they're going f.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:04:35
They haven't shared that part yet, but it came through the Autodesk sales team because they're looking for sheets.
Sachee Perera | 01:04:43
Okay.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:04:46
They're tiling the Autodesk part, but they haven't clearly explained why they want to vote on MKI again. The product manager is... They were more interested in the budget of our software management.
But again, we are doing the budget only for the labor and labor-related costs.
Sachee Perera | 01:05:11
2?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:05:11
So he won the full budget like the materials, labor, subcontracting, and everything.
Sachee Perera | 01:05:17
Yeah.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:05:18
Y then there came the Midway Private Limited.
It's again it's a two 250000000 dollar company that came through our website.
Sachee Perera | 01:05:25
$50 million Company?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:05:29
So they are more looking for that check-in checker. But their requirement was much more specific in terms of they need to live track their subcontractors.
Sachee Perera | 01:05:44
He?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:05:45
And. So our system was more checking the coordinates. Only when they try to check in and check out, they want to keep like what U what Uber is doing, they want to do that.
Sachee Perera | 01:05:56
Correct?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:06:01
So keep on tracking them throughout the day.
We thought that it's too specific to what they're doing. So that didn't go further. But that was again passed through our website as a board. Now, the current group is the one that we are talking about, and Slico is the... These two guys are that we are trialing the product right now.
Sachee Perera | 01:06:29
Yeah.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:06:30
So our current group is an LT company within the construction industry, and Slico is more like an interior fit-out company within the construction. Slico wants their subcontractors to be managed through our platform. Current Group wanted their employees. They're currently running fully on Access Sheet, so they want their employees' time to be tracked and scheduled.
It's pretty much the full software that we are applying to. They have that capability of doing and filing the full software in Current group.
Sachee Perera | 01:07:07
And which one is the one that you're supposed to call today? Is it current or group? Okay y have.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:07:14
I told them. I told them not to call, but I want such. I told them, take a post today. I want you to get in and give a good direction because I don't want to lose them in whatever way that we want to.
Sachee Perera | 01:07:22
You.
Sure. So as in to set the next appointment or and not I and.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:07:37
The next appointment, you asked me if you...
So, there were a few questions that we asked. I just want to get all those three. Yeah, just sort of give these things to you. Then, we can decide if we need to call, then we will call it today before the close of business.
Otherwise, yeah, I just want to make sure that we are not losing that client.
Sachee Perera | 01:08:11
Sure. Okay, I think if they're expecting a call from you today, we should call them today.
I know I gave you a bunch of notes. So, is it... That's called calling them? Or is it Sandy.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:08:26
Look, usually for the last couple of weeks, I've been calling them because I'm the one who used to go to their office and come back. But for the last two weeks, as I said before, they are pushing back.
This person is pushing back due to these financial things. Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:08:48
Okay, I think in these early days, right, till we get initial traction. Yes, you know, Sandy, and all of us, we'll be supporting. I think you being in front of these customers to establish that relationship is really.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:09:07
Y.
Sachee Perera | 01:09:09
So I would... Yeah, I would highly recommend that you... You be the one that establishes that relationship with that key contact as the founder and CEO because they're outside of the product, they're thinking, "Can I trust these guys? Who are they? Can I look them in the eye?"
And know that they're gonna do the right thing. So I think it's important you do that.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:09:34
Yeah, sure. Yeah, I've been trying to for the last two, three weeks. I've been trying to go back to their office, sit with him again and try to do it, but it's been a constant pushback. Then I thought, whether... Something else that might be the reason. Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:10:03
Cool. So maybe before we wrap up today, we can look at... Not right now. Unless you have other things you share. I have a couple of other questions, but, before you wrap up today, if we have a run sheet for that call, I'm happy to...
We don't need to overcomplicate it. Just one or two questions is enough for that very quick call for us to do.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:10:28
Okay.
Sachee Perera | 01:10:29
Okay.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:10:29
Yeah, I she a questions, should, from the last discussion that we had, should we get the directors to be involved in that meeting as well?
So you asked me to go through that question last time we asked, right?
Sachee Perera | 01:10:49
Yeah, so, again, you don't need to get all of the questions answered. It's just you test the waters, test the temperature, right? You establish two things: is this person serious, and is he going to progress? Is he a champion?
The thing is, if he is a champion, what does he need in order to progress the deal, right? What do we need for that?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:11:24
Yeah, according to Policeia.
Sachee Perera | 01:11:24
So the first question... So, those are the two... If we talk about how he can test that, it's using the tone if he is really engaging or not and all of that. We had a bunch of questions that day we wrote down. Do you have them in front of you?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:11:46
Yes, I got that in front of me. So, the questions that we were supposed to ask were in the next meeting that we are applying to have. Should we inform the directors as well to close meetings? Whether that the champion has got any concerns about the product which is holding him back to go forward with the next year.
Sachee Perera | 01:12:17
Yep.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:12:17
If there is a concern, what are their main concerns?
Sachee Perera | 01:12:21
Yep.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:12:22
And if the directors are thinking... What do the directors think about this product? What do we need to do to convince those characters?
Sachee Perera | 01:12:38
Okay, cool, very good. How do you feel about those questions, asking those questions?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:12:47
Yeah. I can go and ask them.
Sachee Perera | 01:12:50
Yeah, I think, if you just keep it really casual, like, "Hey, what's his name?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:12:50
That's.
Sachee Perera | 01:12:57
John Andrew, yeah, if you just keep it really casual, right? "Hey, Andrew, I'm calling you on Friday as promised, for a catch up next week, really keen to get started on a potential implementation. Should we be getting the directors involved in the call for next week?
That's the first thing. Okay, cool. What's the feedback so far? Are there any concerns in the business about the product or any further questions that we need to clarify in the next meeting? If they just want to get him to talk a little bit, that's it.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:13:43
Correct. Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:13:45
And you'll finish the conversation yourself, right? All you need to do is to get the buy-in. Are we going to get directors involved? What are the things you want me to showcase?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:13:58
Yes.
Sachee Perera | 01:13:58
And if he starts, like, getting, like, pushing back. I would just be more direct and be like, hey, Andrew, sounds like there may be some sort of concerns. I'm happy to, you know, obviously see what those concerns might be, what's in the back of your mind if there's a lot of pushback and keep it up as that.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:14:20
Yeah, sure.
Sachee Perera | 01:14:25
Yeah, but there's no... You should be fine. Let's see. Whether he delays back another week, only the 11th of July. So lots of people are still trying to finish their books, right? It's still early days, so I wouldn't be concerned if he pushes back for another
So.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:14:51
Yeah, okay, yeah, probably I think.
Sachee Perera | 01:14:51
You'll be fine.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:14:58
Yeah, that's pretty much it, Sandy. Sorry, Sachee, for what we have done so far. What are the things that we have about the clients' discussions that we had? Do you have any questions?
Sachee Perera | 01:15:14
I'm. keen to dive in and go through the reporting and the calls and really get a better understanding of where you're at and do those things I mentioned in the email. Where can I find your client?
Like, do you have any client demos recorded with or not?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:15:36
I can show you the recording. Because even though we went... I went and sat with a handro in his office. We recorded that full thing in seven.
Sachee Perera | 01:15:51
Yeah. If you're sharing this sheet master list, if you or in a separate note, if you just add those links, then I can click for any of those meetings and really see how you deliver the demos yourself, right?
What are the parts in the calls that people get excited about? All of those key moments would be good to understand.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:16:17
No.
Sachee Perera | 01:16:21
Understand that? Yeah. And are all of these leads? These in CRM as well, or is this just your.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:16:32
All of them are in Seattle. Yes, we haven't put any deal or any value to it, but...
Yeah, but all of them are in CRM, yes, with all the calls that have been made, I put the notes. Whenever I make a call, I put the notes there.
Sachee Perera | 01:16:53
Good.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:16:55
Yeah, emails. Now Sandy is sending all those emails directly from HubSpot.
So yeah, I think all those things are there within the platform.
Sachee Perera | 01:17:05
Cool.
So if you can get me access to HubSpot, your dial pad and HubSpot dial pad, those the account lists from Capita and Sandy's list.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:17:19
Yes.
Sachee Perera | 01:17:24
I think that's a good starting point. Along with your client demos. For me to get my head around the current activities so far.
I'll jump into the marketing stuff a little bit later, but just getting this key stuff first, I think is my fourth point of call.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:17:45
Sure. So you want course access to the course demos and Hubsport.
Sachee Perera | 01:17:50
Yep. So HubSpot calls the demos, the lists, Sandy's lists and Covet's lists, or where I can find them.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:18:05
Sure, yeah, we are using Apollo as well, yes.
Sachee Perera | 01:18:06
And you said you're using Apollo as well, right? Okay, maybe access to that would be good too.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 01:18:19
Can I ask a question? Is it all right? I know it's the time has exceeded, but this is just an open question, okay?
Sachee Perera | 01:18:24
That's right.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 01:18:30
So we can feel really free to answer this question.
Sachee Perera | 01:18:33
No.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 01:18:34
Can can be really truthful as well.
You can say what you want to say, you can say from the bottom of your heart. We never know. So the question is this one. So what do you feel after going through our
we?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:18:51
What do you feel like?
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 01:18:53
What is it?
Sachee Perera | 01:18:55
I think it's... I don't think I've ever heard of anyone going and having an idea and then going, "Boom, product-market fit." It's never a consistent straight road. You're going to have... For every two steps you take forward, right? Or for every step you take forward, you'll take two steps back. Then you'll go back and forth, back and forth.
So I think finding that initial traction is the key thing. I think you, because you've gone from this pivot and that pivot one into pivot two, it's helping you find your niche. I think you're getting there. Now we just need to double down on what that, what that niche is, even further, and focus on that one or two key market segments.
I think you guys have done a good job of. Of really narrowing down as the years have gone. And learning throughout that process. So, which is really good. It's not like you're jumping from one industry to the next.
It's a continuous journey of refinement, which is great, which is where you want to go, right? The good thing is you have the Autodesk partnership live. I think once we get to this next stage of getting this initial traction, you'll be able to...
Yeah, I think that's really a very valuable thing you guys did, and it sounds like you learned a lot about traction in the cre and everything so far.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 01:20:41
Yes.
Sachee Perera | 01:20:46
So, which is great. The only thing I would have probably delayed it is foundered sales, which is what's going to get you into your product-market fit, right?
Doing the work around the marketing and getting the sales people is important, but I think, Bonnie, if we can get you back in the driver's seat and in front of these customers as much as possible,
I think that's what's going to help add some rocket fuel into getting Sandy and Kabita up and running.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:21:30
Yeah, I just want to add that on all the demos. I'm still presenting the demo.
Sachee Perera | 01:21:42
Okay? Yup.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:21:42
I'm still. I'm still the one that's going to the client's office as soon as the.
Sachee Perera | 01:21:46
Yes.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:21:48
I think where I got the problem is. So, say, for example, if someone is pushing back, I'm still thinking that.
Okay, whether they need the product or they don't need the product or.
Sachee Perera | 01:22:04
He.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:22:05
So you can clearly see from our history that lack of sales experience is very clear in many of those cases or going deep into those areas.
Say, for example, I'm still asking every day. I'm asking myself on a daily basis, how many current groups will there be? Because that's when the full product can be used. Whether we should... If you look at the visitors who are coming to your website,
it's from a lot of industries, but some of them we can see that there are use cases, but I'm still... When the sales team says there are not enough leads, is that the right thing? I don't know. Is that the look, how can we find out? Hundred current groups. Current groups who are still using Excel sheets, calendars, or all those things. Or how can we find out where we should call? Dig deep into it.
So, it might be some resistance from people who are already using some system. If you can find out someone who is very primitive in the space, using Excel sheets and all those things, that would be the easiest or fastest way.
That's what I'm thinking Y.
Sachee Perera | 01:23:52
Yeah. So I think that's why I'm really keen to understand the size of your market, right? That's why I want the lists. This is important. You think current groups are your ideal customer, from the product that you have built to their requirements, you think that's a perfect fit, or what? Regardless of whether they buy or not,
maybe let me ask this in another way. The product that you have built that you have right now, do you feel like it's perfect for current groups?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:24:35
Yes. That's what I think because, when we talk about Time Sheet, I can see the excitement in his face.
Sachee Perera | 01:24:45
I can see inside of the space. I believe you can see it in front of the video that we're doing, a really close race.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:24:48
You could see that from the video that we are doing from the Andros space. Okay, you can do that.
Sachee Perera | 01:24:53
You can do that video and that and you can and indely it to then the second meeting Thanksgiving for the but the same with the they would not like we have not culate the moment that we by scheduling part to protect the very effective of Inc.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:24:53
Okay, you can do that then you can... Okay, and you can directly export that to Myo. Well, good. Then I then on the second meeting, directed came in and when we presented to them all the time sheet part, they were not that keen.
Like we have gone quickly the moment that we get into the scheduling part. Then they started asking more questions related to the Gantt chart. Okay, good, then you got a schedule.
Sachee Perera | 01:25:28
Tech can only on my side that when that was it doesn't get those type issues and when the small st it looks like and what you see what we can do deeping figures of sp yeah you see I we complete something yes that would be okay that's interesting that's really good to know.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:25:29
Alright, so that's when they were interested, but again, it was a bit of connection issues. They were in a small laptop screen, it looks like.
So those things I would be able to see. But coming back to your question, they need I believe they can make use of the full product. We got a compliance part as well where they store the licenses and all those which I checked with Andrew and they told that they are using the accounting software for storing the compliance documents or something like that or some other software.
So yeah, I believe that the current group would be the right customer who can use everything within our softter.
Sachee Perera | 01:26:28
You. talked a little bit about your TAM numbers before.
Like the total number of accounts. I think in one of our first conversations. Do you need to answer this right now? Maybe when you... If and I don't need it urgently in the next couple of days or when you have time, if you find that... Goes back.
So those numbers. If you can send that through to me as well, that'll be very helpful.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:26:57
So when you say that... When I got always doubts such a.
Sachee Perera | 01:26:59
So that's when I do the.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:27:04
When you look at online, the full total construction industry or total companies raised here in Australia under construction is 450,000 companies.
They say that 98% of those companies are SMBS.
Sachee Perera | 01:27:22
Yeah, yes.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:27:22
Okay? Only 2% of the big companies. But then when I tell Sandy to all the marketing team to go and get the lead, they're even.
Sachee Perera | 01:27:35
The conflict.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:27:39
They can't find it. So I can't relate the data that I'm getting from the internet to the data they're data.
Sachee Perera | 01:27:42
And getting the T 20 detector.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:27:46
There should be something backing this to support this, right?
Sachee Perera | 01:27:50
Okay.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:27:51
So in our investor pitch, I put there only 3,000 companies as service obtainable companies.
Sachee Perera | 01:27:57
Only.
Yeah.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:28:09
I'm not sure whether there are more than that or less than that or are we? Is our sales team not having enough idea where they have to go and find it out.
Sachee Perera | 01:28:12
Second to middle. The.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:28:22
They are trying.
So we are manually getting through Yellow Pages and enriching that through Apollo. That's how we used to do it. We are doing. Right now.
Sachee Perera | 01:28:37
Look, without diving deeper, I won't be able to give you any direct answer, but just thinking about businesses like Procore, Simcorp, all of these, they're in the same trades, right?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:28:41
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:28:52
Fergus and I saw on there the 2000 number. It sounds unlikely. It sounds like there should be more than that, but maybe we can... Let's try to answer this question as well, like how many current groups are
cool. I'm excited to help answer these questions. You guys have done a good job so far getting to where you are now, right? You're just on the cusp of progressing to the next page. It's just like getting initial traction is the most challenging thing, right?
So getting your first five customers or first five to ten is the most critical and it's gonna be the most challenging but the most fun as well. Now that we have a niche down into this construction and the key use cases as well.
So let's jump into it, let's see if we can get there. Yeah. If you have those numbers that report that you have, if you can send that through to me, that'll be good. Then I can cross-check against what Sandy and Kabita has.
Then I'll do my own research. The tool that I use as well.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:30:26
Okay? And with WY, yeah. Key points. I'm sorry.
Sachee Perera | 01:30:35
You guys go.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 01:30:37
I see in one of the next meetings, we would like to know how a journey was planned in court. You can just drink it. But it sounds like you've done a great job in core plan, so I'm really excited to hear your story. Yes, as well.
If you are not now, in one of the next meetings.
Sachee Perera | 01:30:52
Yeah, no, I think I may have shared with Bonnie or maybe we can save it for the next. Yeah, absolutely.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 01:31:04
Yes.
Sachee Perera | 01:31:05
Yeah. Cool. We can do that with the IG and service.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:31:07
Look, I'll be open with you, Sandy. Asa. From where it's coming from, it's more like Lisa always asks me, she's always getting doubtful when we don't have the customers.
Sachee Perera | 01:31:13
It's coming. So.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:31:25
And we making any step further? Are we taking at least one step further?
She always raised that question against me, and sometimes getting those five customers or getting one customer at least because she's been looking at me.
Sachee Perera | 01:31:47
Is. I see. They're looking at this.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:31:53
I resigned from my job in 2022 of having this team and going forward, and after three years, you don't... Are you in a dream world, or are you really going forward?
Sachee Perera | 01:31:55
The tech in this SP.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:32:13
So I think that's when... So she's trying to relate. Okay, if that she says that Kpran had the same struggle in the initial phase, then okay, that makes sense. Otherwise, look, this guy is crazy, and he's going somewhere. Which is in a fancy world. Whether we are going to get there or not, it's not sure.
Sachee Perera | 01:32:40
Like be honest, if you were in a dream world, I wouldn't waste my time. So, being truthful, if you're not going to be interested in my time, I'm not going to do that, right?
I think you're on the right track. I think there are some quick wins we can get by just doing this. Well, firstly, getting the current group across. I'm keen to hear how you go in today's call. I don't want to necessarily block this call because I need to get up to speed.
So I think whatever you're going to do, the extra information from me will help you with the next step. But I don't think I... Yeah, like GT and perseverance will help you guys succeed, right? The retros and really understanding the customer and knowing when to pivot and when to double down is the thing.
If you're talking about time sheets and the costs around that, that's why I know you're not in the dream world right now. That's basically what we solved at CorePlan, but for DRs, right? What is the log of the drill, but instead of trades and construction, it's foriling, so it's the same thing as an invoice, right? The same thing as a small business collecting your information and putting it on... It's the same. The funny thing is when you jump from one industry to the next, which I have at SideKicker and all of these other businesses, you see the patterns.
At SideKicker, we did the same thing, which was another completely separate business. It was just a time sheet, but it was one person for 50 people, at the same time. But you're not in a dream world, so I think you guys are in a good position.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:35:09
Okay, there you go. That's the answer to your initial question. Because I just had to... Yeah, thanks for confirming that, because sometimes.
Sachee Perera | 01:35:20
Now.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:35:22
Yes, sometimes I do feel that if Nisha asked me that question ten times, sometimes when she asks the 11th time, I still sometimes doubt
so yeah, it's a long journey. You bet so many things on this journey. There are a lot of people dependent on me as well in terms of... Yeah, to prove what we are doing is worth what we are doing.
It's good.
Sachee Perera | 01:35:55
I cool.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:35:56
Good to know.
Sachee Perera | 01:35:58
Now keep your head up, keep pushing forward. That's the only way. And your disclose, right? You're there with a bunch of trials, you're getting progress, you're getting the time, you're doubling down on the messaging for the key use cases, you're there, you're almost there, you just need to keep going.
So, yeah, we'll... We'll be... Any questions from me about how the next couple of weeks will go?
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:36:38
Come I will keep... So I think we need to... Yeah, you can share that. NTA the one thing and then I will give you the calls, demos, HubSpot, all those as I go and fix those things.
Sachee Perera | 01:36:47
Yeah. Yes.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:36:56
I'll go and call Andrew and keep you updated on the email how that thing goes then scientists list and comes list.
I'll share those things Apollo access and everything that you have said in that email.
Sachee Perera | 01:37:06
No, yes.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:37:09
I'll put all the links to your document in a single document. Then probably we will give... We will set up an account for you as well, especially on the inside Zoho and Microsoft so that you can get all the internal files and folders and everything.
Sachee Perera | 01:37:30
He.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:37:31
Is that going to be too hard for Like.
Sachee Perera | 01:37:34
I haven't used Zoho, actually. No, that's what I have used Zoho once upon a time. But I'll figure out my way around and.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:37:42
Yeah, so if you yeah, I can run you through, it's pretty much like the Google cloud or micro Microsoft.
Sachee Perera | 01:37:50
It.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:37:52
Yeah, it's, one drive. They call it a Soha Drive, so Outlook, they called it a Zoho Mail.
Sachee Perera | 01:37:57
Okay.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:38:02
That's it. It has a different name. It's pretty much the same thing. SLI instead of SLI, we use Zoho click.
Sachee Perera | 01:38:11
Yes, yeah, co sounds like a plan.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:38:11
So. I'll try to give you all those things handed out in a meeting as quickly as possible, then share everything with you, then we'll go from there.
Yeah, and one more thing, Sachee. I just want to let you know that we are very open with whatever negative suggestions you have. Don't feel that, okay, that's going to hurt this body. We never have things like that. You can come and talk to us in whatever way that you think it's not going to work.
If it's working, tell us that, okay? If it's not working, tell me that, okay? When you did a very shitty job, we are happy to take that and so don't feel be open with us.
Yeah. I'll talk to you much more in detail when I come and see you in person?
Sachee Perera | 01:39:18
Yeah, I will be challenging you and testing your assumptions and the things you say, how direct I may be.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:39:19
Y.
Sachee Perera | 01:39:33
I probably won't tell you my [Laughter] unless you're in really big trouble, then I will, but yeah, I will.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:39:37
[Laughter] yes.
Sachee Perera | 01:39:48
That's. the thing with everyone. I'm always testing them for... Well, get them to reflect on the actions. Why are you doing it this way or why didn't you do it that way? Okay, so I will be testing that, and as we work together a little bit more, we'll figure out what our best way way.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:40:07
[Laughter] to. [Laughter] Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:40:10
Yeah, alright, cool guys. Thank you so much for your time. I've got so many notes over here. This is really good. I will send you this mutual NDA I found. I found the one-way NDA. There's another mutual one I have which I can send through to you.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:40:24
He.
Sachee Perera | 01:40:29
I'll try and get through to YouTube later today or once I've found it somewhere in my drive.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:40:35
Y?
Sachee Perera | 01:40:36
Yeah, so awesome.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:40:36
Sure.
Sachee Perera | 01:40:38
Alright Nisha, nice to see you again.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:40:38
Thank.
Sachee Perera | 01:40:41
Bonnie, have a safe flight. Let's coordinate after the NDA and all the documentation, then let's coordinate a time for me to really first understand the basics first. I'm not going to be making any recommendations or any actions straightway.
I'll first understand the problem first and really talk to you more.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:41:03
8.
Sachee Perera | 01:41:08
Talk to Nisha. Talk to Sandy. Talk to Kabita. All these guys. First, to really form what is working and what's not and really test.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:41:13
Flo, please.
Sachee Perera | 01:41:19
Get an idea from what Sandy said. Or they can't find these accounts so they can't find the leads. What does that mean?
And yeah, a little bit more in that stuff.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:41:30
Sure. Absolutely.
No, too.
Sachee Perera | 01:41:34
A good day.
boney.mylady@swiftcheckin.com.au | 01:41:37
Enjoy your day by.

===== Start of swift__intro_meeting_with_jayadev_transcript.txt =====

Sachee Perera | 00:15
Hey Jdev, how are you?
Jayadev | 00:17
Hey. Good. How are you?
Sachee Perera | 00:19
Yeah, good my friend, good. What time is it there?
Jayadev | 00:25
It's 11:35 am.
Sachee Perera | 00:26
[Laughter] Okay, cool. Wow, right, it's all lunch time. [Laughter] NI nice to chat to you, for the first time.
Jayadev | 00:33
Yeah.
Notice that you changed your background to a more relaxing relaxing.
Sachee Perera | 00:47
Yeah. Because it was just the background for my, of my house before. [Laughter] Yeah, very keen to understand a little bit more about you know what, the areas of the business that you touch, and you know, a little bit more about you really and, you know, how you found yourself at Swift check in and all of that.
Jayadev | 00:58
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:17
So how long have you been with the business?
Jayadev | 01:20
It's about going to be a year's time now.
Sachee Perera | 01:23
Wow, cool.
Jayadev | 01:24
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:24
Yeah, that's quite a while. Yeah, very, so you must have been here, before the second pivot, when you had the event, the airport event after that.
Okay. Right. Cool.
Jayadev | 01:47
I joined after that because they told me that they had the airport event after I joined.
Sachee Perera | 01:52
Yeah, sure. And do you work full time in the business or are you.
Jayadev | 01:54
Yeah, that, yeah, so let's start.
Sachee Perera | 01:59
Yeah, cool.
Jayadev | 02:08
What's the most important thing you want to know? Let's start with that [Laughter] he.
Sachee Perera | 02:12
I'm kind of I'm very keen to understand like what how you run marketing. And you know, what are the learnings so far, especially in the last three to four months where you have been doing lots of experimentation and I have gone into Google Analytics.
I've been looking at Apollo. And a lot of these things. But I want to hear from you directly: "Yeah, what are the key things or key activities that you are focusing on right now? What have the things that have worked this year so far?"
What are the things that are not working?
Jayadev | 02:55
Good. Okay, let me start maybe a few months beyond six months, I would say, because I think that will give you the right context. So I think the first thing... Have you seen what the oldest website homepage reviews are that you see?
Sachee Perera | 03:24
I've only seen this version and maybe the one in may?
Jayadev | 03:28
Yeah, you were having a conversation with Bonnie in that area that... Yeah, okay, so I'll give you context to that. Yeah, so when I joined, the focus of the broader verse on the website was basically about article check and cetera, that was the main thing, right?
But if you look at dividing the features into modules, we had a few features under a lot all the modules.
Sachee Perera | 04:04
Y.
Jayadev | 04:12
But it was not... We didn't have all the features for each of the models, right? So initially, we started with the revamp of the website or the look and feel of it to actually make it look like a B-size business, because the first version was like a 1990s website, right?
Sachee Perera | 04:37
Yeah.
Jayadev | 04:44
So yeah. So I think initially the effort was to kind of get that really understand who are we selling to and what are we selling, right? So I think the first few months there was our focus was on builders.
Sachee Perera | 05:05
YP.
Jayadev | 05:06
And we learnt about the setup of the infrastructure of the builders, we kind of figured that when we asked the question, "Who is going to pay for the product?" Is it the builder guy who's saying that?
Okay, this is my site, and I want all the information. Or is it the subcontractors company that is coming in and saying, "Okay, I will pay for it because I need to be a part of this builder's thing, right?" Associated with this builder, right?
So that was the area that we were focusing on initially when we thought of creating the initial version of the pricing page. We had separate pricing for the builder and separate pricing for the contractor.
As we had the conversations we had with the initial set of customers and kind of things, we made us ask more questions about how we were going to price the product, what the positioning of the product in that case should be.
So it was a subcontractor, it was a builder. We were like, "Okay, the product caters to both these circles, but which one do we go after?" Those were the initial sets of thoughts. We started off focusing on the builder.
If you can see our current website, if you go to the features page, the features homepage has a construction website as the background and talks about the entire thing.
Sachee Perera | 06:56
AA con.
Jayadev | 07:00
So our focus was saying that.
Okay, the builder has more money than the subcontractor. So let's target him and see how well this story goes. We did some amount of repositioning in terms of our message towards it.
We ran a bunch of campaigns trying to target builders, but we did not get a positive response to all those efforts. One of the reasons we found out was that when a builder compared our product to any other product in the market, we lost out on the feature list itself.
Sachee Perera | 07:56
On the what feature listed?
Jayadev | 07:57
On the feature list, am I audible?
Is it?
Sachee Perera | 08:01
Yeah. Yeah. You're fine.
Jayadev | 08:01
Yeah. Okay. Right, so we lost out on the feature list itself. What it meant is that a builder, if he's looking at construction management software, would say that. Okay, let's start with materials, right?
So that's one model, then your check-in sector, then your project management, then maybe your design and architecture, that bit of it, right?
Sachee Perera | 08:23
So. Cur.
Jayadev | 08:34
And then you have your budgeting and your costs, all of that, right?
So if you broadly put it out, we figured that we were labor-focused and we didn't really have all the features that a full-fledged software would have across these modules. Right?
So suppose that we went back and did an exercise of actually mapping out the features that the product had at that point in time and going back and saying that, "Okay, what category does this product fall under?
Sachee Perera | 09:26
Yp.
Jayadev | 09:28
Right? So it was more... The learning from that was it's not so much, I would say, construction management for a builder, but it's more in the terms of, contractor management software and probably more aligned to a subcontractor's business than a builder's business, right?
Sachee Perera | 10:01
Yeah.
Jayadev | 10:03
While, I mean, the materials part, et cetera, is still... What part of the basics?
If we called ourselves a product that is focused on optimizing labor because that's what we purely focus on, that would be a better fit in terms of what a product has to offer today. What the market wants or what we think ends up being ideal, the same...
So.
Sachee Perera | 10:42
So the first management software is as?
Jayadev | 10:42
So workforce management software and contractor management software were two of the categories when we mapped out the features of competitors and we said, "This is our features." What is the overlap there and what are the missing things? We found that there was a larger overlap in terms of features in those categories as compared to the construction management period.
But construction management software is a term that is used by everybody, right? And that definition of what construction management is for each of these guys is different, right?
Sachee Perera | 11:19
Y.
Jayadev | 11:21
So that's I think, so there's no real industry definition saying that construction management software has to do a PCB, right? The person doing just a is still calling himself a construction management software.
If you know a person doing or a company doing just A is still calling it Motion. So, right. So we did a repositioning again, rebuilt the website and the messaging around that, right? And then said, "Okay, let's try to start targeting the contractor." The entire contractor business and for ourselves, a software solution for the business for the contractor's business kind of thing.
So that's the overall product positioning standpoint where we are and how we pay that we are right. There is still an overlap between builders, but I don't think the builder would a small builder maybe, but not really, say a mid-size or a large guy would not really engage with this, right?
So that's what, yeah.
Sachee Perera | 12:38
So how did... So if I could go back and ask a couple of questions around that. So you said when you went to the builders, it wasn't working.
And you did.
Jayadev | 12:48
Eight.
Sachee Perera | 12:49
We lost out on the feature list and they wanted the materials and different parts of the business. How did you find that out?
Jayadev | 12:55
Hey.
Sachee Perera | 12:56
Like what was it from sales calls or was it from purely ad performance?
So. Like, how did you get that? How did you know? It wasn't working?
Jayadev | 13:07
Okay. So we had a hypothesis that you should run after builders did small experiments with a minimum budget to reach out to them, and there was nothing that we didn't stick with anybody.
Sachee Perera | 13:19
Yep.
Jayadev | 13:28
Which means that from an ad performance perspective, the answer was a negative over that.
Right? And after that, we went and said, okay, clearly from a research perspective, let's list on the feature list of the other competitors that are right?
Sachee Perera | 13:45
Right?
Jayadev | 13:47
So when you did that, we automatically said that.
Okay, how many grains and how many eggs are there from a feature perspective?
Sachee Perera | 13:54
Yes.
Jayadev | 13:55
So that clearly gave us a perspective saying that, hey, you can still be a labor-focused solution, but then you need to... The question was how much of the needle would you move from a labor perspective, right?
So if you're spending 70% of your total cost on labor, right, are you going to reduce it to 50%, 40%, 30%?
Sachee Perera | 14:31
Yeah.
Jayadev | 14:31
That kind of... Right? So the answer again, you're moving it marginally, but it's not going to be significant, that's what...
And yeah, the other part was the problems that the industry faced. For example, Nauses is a big concern, right? So is your software going to solve any of the real-world problems that are there? The answer to that, I mean, a question like the not show was that software is not going to do anything to solve this problem. It's not going to show up. It's not going to show up irrespective of what software you use, right?
So this is the overall thing, right? So then we figured that, hey, we really aren't solving that problem.
Sachee Perera | 15:31
Yes. Yeah.
Jayadev | 15:33
We can call ourselves construction management software even today, right?
Sachee Perera | 15:36
Yes.
Jayadev | 15:36
And position ourselves. But honestly, if we reflect upon what we have built and think about it, it really doesn't fall under a whole suite of proper transition management software. We'll get to that eventually. Yes, as we keep building.
But as of today, it's not. We should not be telling that story because what's gonna happen is the moment you get on a call, the sales calls are going to be back because we're all promising on the marketing side and under delivering on the sales side, which is not a good sign.
Sachee Perera | 16:15
Yeah.
Jayadev | 16:15
So yeah, so that's basically how we can get that back.
Sachee Perera | 16:20
Understood. So are you're running, so currently you're running some paid ads on Google Ads and Reddit. And are you running Facebook and LinkedIn as well? Or just Facebook?
Jayadev | 16:35
Okay, I'll give you an overview of this. So we started with Google and LinkedIn. The problem is that there is no search for you. So, what we have understood is our ICP is not Texavy.
Sachee Perera | 17:00
Yp.
Jayadev | 17:02
They don't even like a simple thing like a free trial, which I sold to the US market a lot.
So the standard sort of actions, even whichever industry it is, they would basically at least take one step forward. The Australian market is, I would say, ten years behind that, right? Where they are not the sick.
So what we did on LinkedIn didn't work. We ran Google ads with very little money, and we figured out that the competition is spending a lot more, right? So you're spending about $20-$25 per click.
Right, that's what there's...
Yeah, click on Google ads for certain keywords.
Sachee Perera | 17:57
On LinkedIn.
Jayadev | 18:03
Yeah, it's... So the fingers, the guy with the biggest purse has just bumped up the rates, right? So you are here saying that I can't spend more than $5 a click, $3 a click, and you don't basically feature anything, and it's just that, right?
Sachee Perera | 18:15
$8 and you basically... It's just that way.
Jayadev | 18:20
So.
So we tried that, we didn't kind of. I mean, we spent very small budgets like $500, you know, of that nature, right?
Sachee Perera | 18:25
I mean. Very small business like kind among.
Jayadev | 18:32
And, so yeah, basically Google has a channel from a search perspective because of this. Then kind of take off the way they think.
And then we said, okay, now so the digital landscape is kind of limited over that. So we said that instead of a full strategy, let's look at a push like let's go to the customer wherever he's in one what chaimators, right?
And then we started reit so on re we're getting traffic yes, is it converting no initial right now what we have done. So on Reit, we started with ads. We have started answering q and any questions trying to build a brand there and to get the word out and from the pure a bit it's purely it's completely non salesy because Reit would immediately just star that, right?
Sachee Perera | 19:27
M yeah.
Jayadev | 19:30
So it's just purely having conversations, providing value, asking nothing in return. People who want to see okay, provideed value. The user profile itself is to check in so they can come and see a Qur LA that works right?
So that is right now I would say it is a warm channel. Right now it is not really like a ho channel that we are like, okay, yes, this is s that is what LinkedIn has. The number of people that we're going after on LinkedIn is less, the volume itself is less. We've done a ads message as that has not really taken off in the way we wanted it to take out because purely because of the volume Facebook we haven't tried yet.
Sachee Perera | 20:17
With children. But not every technology in the way we wanted it to take up business And.
Jayadev | 20:30
It's in our pipeline to kind of... Because we just started posting on Facebook right now, it's all linked and posted. We should really focus on Facebook. So, in the initial months, just get that thing out and see what's happening from an organic standpoint on Facebook, and then I think in the following months, we can option a small budget to test on Facebook as well.
So that's one thing. LLM calling, I think, is the best way to go right now? So, as a channel that technically is supposed to work, because they're more in the email, call, group, and IR ICP is primarily known in that right?
Sachee Perera | 21:24
One?
Jayadev | 21:26
So yeah, overall, I would say that the traditional online channels have not really worked. We had to think out of the box to say that things... Our initial goal was to first get traffic right.
So, I think somewhere we are starting to see the numbers increase from a traffic perspective. Right now, our next stage is to see why we aren't getting any phone fills on the right?
Sachee Perera | 22:07
Yeah.
Jayadev | 22:09
So we had, like a request for amo free trial.
I mean, all the possible altractions that you can think of. We kind of experimented with that and kept on for some time to see what the result is. So all this while the result was zero.
Sachee Perera | 22:27
Y.
Jayadev | 22:28
Zero in the sense that we've got a few leads, but it's not really like a life-changing lead from that perspective, right?
So in my head, it is zero, right? And so now I've gone back to saying that. Okay, if this guy is so non-tech-savvy that he clicks the start, he hasn't clicked a requested demo, he hasn't clicked any of the existing "get started" whatever it is, right? That we have planned earlier, we have moved it this month to just contact sales.
Right as a thing. And you made the name, email, and contact number compulsory, saying that we need a right. So let's... We're going to run this for the entire month and see what kind of... Out of it. And if the result is negative, I'm just going to reduce the friction of that itself. Can they just give me an email address so that at least I can start seeing people interact with the website and show intent of some sort, saying that, "Hey, I'm interested in being..."
So that's the primary focus over there, right? And yeah, this is.
Sachee Perera | 23:54
The on the website. I think there was a spike in the number of activities on the 14th or 15th. Did you start a new campaign there or was that organic?
Jayadev | 24:07
No, organic is actually on the decline thanks to a and yeah, it's one of the campaigns that we are running, right? So it's pretty bad organic actually, it's a decline across the industry because of AI and the AI search rules.
Sachee Perera | 24:24
Ye.
Jayadev | 24:26
So I don't know if your Google search patterns have changed, but mine have currently changed because when I put a query, I don't go beyond the first screen because all the information is presented there. So the sponsored ads and the organic searches beyond that, I have not clicked the link for a really long time.
So that's a thing across the landscape, changing. So we are writing content more. How do we get featured over there? That is the intent of what you're doing right now?
Sachee Perera | 24:57
Yeah, sorry, give me one second.
Jayadev | 25:01
Yeah, no reason.
Sachee Perera | 25:04
Okay, I start. What was I going to say?
So do you have anyone supporting you? Are you the guy building the website? Are you the one doing the ads? Are you.
Jayadev | 25:15
I no.
Sachee Perera | 25:15
Are you doing gra?
Jayadev | 25:18
I the I was doing it. I was a one-man army for some time. We have Gunish in my team, who is the content guy right now.
Sachee Perera | 25:29
Yeah.
Jayadev | 25:30
So I've passed on all the content, so I've built all the websites. The content written is where we design. We have Bonnie who's taking so we had an existing design, obviously with feedback and input.
Sachee Perera | 25:35
After eating all that, it's mine and everything that's you.
Jayadev | 25:46
We improved the design of the entire thing over a period of time, but now we're broadly got.
So Bonnie designed, Gunish is coming, and I passed on all the blog posts, all the content pieces, TED, Q&A, all of that he takes care of.
Sachee Perera | 25:53
Yeah.
Jayadev | 26:08
I write the landing pages, the copy of the website, and the pay-per-ads. I take care of it completely.
Right now, with the limited resources that we have, I think all of us are working at 100%. We have Constantin Pask coming up. So I think we are having momentum there.
That's on this thing, it's just now in terms of... It's time to try and see some results. I think that's where the last main issue is, right? I think you've done a lot of work already.
It's just that, why aren't people doing it? Because if this is a US market, I saw results eight months ago.
Sachee Perera | 26:59
Yeah, the Aussie market's very different, right?
Jayadev | 27:01
SOR so yeah.
Sachee Perera | 27:06
Like they're very close knit. They are, like you said, ten years behind the Americans. Especially for small businesses.
It's not... Even then, the population... We only have 22 million people in Australia, right? So the volumes are significantly lower, and it's more challenging.
Jayadev | 27:26
Three.
Sachee Perera | 27:32
But just one question, I have a couple more questions.
Jayadev | 27:35
Hey.
Sachee Perera | 27:36
So the websites and WordPress... Is it just... Have you built it? Is it on... Does the development team run it themselves?
Jayadev | 27:46
The development team runs it themselves, so we have moved the block section to WordPress recently. Earlier, it was Reiti, so we moved it. Yeah, so to WordPress right now. Just for the blocking, right?
Sachee Perera | 28:02
Okay, cool.
Jayadev | 28:03
Yes, yeah, of course.
Sachee Perera | 28:04
And look, I think we will... I'll need to chat to you again next week, but the work on the website and everything is really good. I'm excited to see how we take it to the next steps and evolve.
I'm trying to understand like you said, construction management software... There are so many stakeholders, right? Construction management software versus contractor management are two separate things, right? How do we position.
Jayadev | 28:41
Yeah, we have created something like that, yeah, the next.
Sachee Perera | 28:42
But from what I caught up with Sandy and Nisha, they said that you have done some work on competitor analysis. Do you have a spreadsheet of all the different competitors and things like that? And do you have any other documentation? Sales brochures, slide decks, and things like that as well.
Jayadev | 29:10
So we've created a one PGER I think this is quite some time. But. So one pager for sales just for them to kind of hand over that is what. The other thing that we did was the recent set of case studies that we put
up. So this is purely from the initial conversations that the sales team had, right? So we got that info and we translated that to a KPI. Don't know if you've seen the case study, but yeah, I think it's in one of those shared folders itself, so I'll see if I can pull out one quickly.
Right? Of the meeting, but take a look at it. It's "No name" and nothing. It's just the problem statement and how you're solving the specific problem that the user can face. So we've created about four of them right now.
Yeah, those are the two things that we've done from a serious enablement standpoint. We tech... I think Bonnie is working on the pitch deck. That's the only tech that we have, but we haven't worked on a sales PD which.
Sachee Perera | 30:21
4. Okay.
Jayadev | 30:27
So I think that yeah, the requirement in terms of... So we just didn't push because we've got our hands full already right now to, you know. So yeah.
Sachee Perera | 30:37
Do you have a design guide or a design system with the brand colors and stuff that you can share with me after this call?
Jayadev | 30:45
The brand guidelines, we haven't documented it like it's not documented, but I can ask Bonnie to take care of it.
Sachee Perera | 30:49
Okay. And he does.
Jayadev | 30:56
So he's the designer right now. So we haven't formulated it because, yeah, we need to first find customers before we [Laughter] get all these...
Yeah, so the brand guidelines are not there, but yeah, so you give the... You write the content, I'll tell you the process, right?
Sachee Perera | 31:11
That's okay. It's. No, when I. When I like when I do slide decks. I like to use the branding and the colors and stuff.
Jayadev | 31:25
It will be easier for you. You decide what you want from a content perspective. When you run, you'll design it for you.
Yeah, so you don't even need to get into a pre-formatted design. This thing that we have right now, we don't have right now. We can create one if you want quickly. Yeah, I'd rather say that you focus on the content bit and give it to so that maybe a couple of iterations you get to see the final picture.
So let him take that.
Sachee Perera | 31:54
Sure. Okay, that's fine.
Jayadev | 31:55
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 31:56
That's cool. Alright, Matt, that was very helpful. Thank you so much for jumping on.
Yeah, I will send you a message at some point next week and we can go from there. If you can kindly send me any kind of reporting that you have done for the ads or anything like that, that would be good.
Jayadev | 32:18
So we have an A/B testing report thing that we use in our organizations. Apart from that, I think you've got access to all of the tools. So you can just export in order format. I'll give you the access to this.
I'll just try to... Okay, do this, one thing right on chat, just list out all the things that you need. I'll just repeat that. That will be the easiest thing.
Sachee Perera | 32:50
One that'll be good, awesome, mate.
Jayadev | 32:51
You know, confusion. Yeah, okay.
Sachee Perera | 32:54
Thank you so much. You have a great day. Hey, I'll... Enjoy. You can see me next week, see?
Jayadev | 32:57
Yeah, sure. Take care half of.

nisha.george@dibasys.com | 00:00
Hey, Sachee, thanks.
Sachee Perera | 00:00
He sache hey, how are you?
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 00:04
How are you?
Sachee Perera | 00:05
I'm good.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 00:06
Yeah, good to see you again.
Sachee Perera | 00:09
Yes, for sure.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 00:11
Yeah, yes.
Sachee Perera | 00:12
I don't have a double screen, so I'm like, [Laughter] I need to get a portable screen. CA when I'm working, I like to have multiple screens on. That's I'm when I'm doing a lot of different jumping between lots of different things, so but I think I might do that over the weekend.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 00:27
Thanks. Yeah, time is flying so fast, or too.
Sachee Perera | 00:31
How's. is it just
How's the week going? I can't believe it's the end of the week now.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 00:39
It's like, yeah, it's going so quick, but we feel like we are moving the dots, so yeah, pretty happy about it.
Sachee Perera | 00:48
Good. Yeah, I just wanted to... So I've only caught up with Sandy the day and just listening to all the calls and everything and catching up with Jav right after this one.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 01:02
Yeah, alright, cool.
Sachee Perera | 01:04
Yeah, I'm keen to really find out about...
Yeah, what areas of the business are you touching? What are you seeing? What do you think I should be looking for? Where should I be going into? From your perspective.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 01:25
So first of all, I would say, wherever there is a gap, I just jump in and then... But, yeah, I predominantly look after the admin and HR and mostly in India because our team, the number of team members are more in India.
But setting that for the Australian team in the future as well, just sitting at the systems. I oversee accounts. We've got external outsourced teams both in India and in Australia for accounts, so I supervise that. As I said, admin and HR, I try to bring up the systems. Then I do... I am a part of the business decision-making and then customer documentation that is...
That is actually a recent post that I've taken over. Then funding as well. Because Bonnie alone, his time is not really enough to go forward. So I do help with... So when whatever Bonnie is not able to take over, I just take over and then I do a bit of market analysis and competitor analysis. Even though we've got a marketing team, sometimes I find their idea or perception sometimes doesn't match with the product itself.
So I try to do a little bit so that we can give more understanding to them in terms of where the product really goes. I sit with the tech team or the product team as a layman.
When I give commands, they understand it as a common man in terms of UI and UX. Then, yeah, it looks like it's a bit everywhere if you ask me. Which area am I? Constant writing? There is no specific answer for that, but it's just an overview of everything, and if something needs in-depth attention, I put my head around and then I do that, actually.
In terms of the audit, if you want to take a look, the customer documentation and customer onboarding are the parts that I would say.
Currently, myself, Bonnie, and Sandy, we both are actually giving the inputs as the opportunity comes.
Sachee Perera | 04:00
One.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 04:05
So example, if it's for Andrew and the Slack group that we're currently working on with the trials,
we just do the steps on the go like whatever they want. And then the tweak, and then that makes us the base so that it can serve for the future purpose. So, things like that. So, it's just in a very rudimentary stage.
Yeah, picking up on the go.
Sachee Perera | 04:30
Cool. Sandy said you had done some competitor analysis. Before, do you have, like, a Google sheet? Sorry, an Excel sheet or a word document? On the findings.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 04:44
Yeah, I've started with that, but the thing is, I couldn't complete that. I'm extremely sorry about it. It's in my top of the head. Everything is in my top of the head, and I get a chance to really put it in.
So, what happened was initially, the marketing did that Comet. So even when you talk with J, they've got detailed sheets in the world drive with the competitive analysis.
But when I went through it, I felt like it could be much more deeper because initially, the days, and now as well, I do a lot of research where we are up to and who our real competitors are. Then, because we understood we handle a bit of everything, we handle a bit of project management, we handle a bit of field operations, we handle a bit of safety, we do a bit of course management.
Sachee Perera | 05:37
H yeah.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 05:39
So we got the pillars for everything. For each area, we got different competitors. For example, for the time sheets, we got Deputy and we got Asana, so. But they're in different RPMs or different Ics they're focusing on.
So, I started to put it in the Excel sheet, but it is not complete. I will definitely.
Sachee Perera | 06:06
I if you even if you have, like, an unfinished version.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 06:07
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 06:09
Like, all I'm all I want to do is to try and get onboard it as fast as possible.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 06:13
Yes.
Sachee Perera | 06:17
So if you have anything, don't worry about it not being fit, whatever, share it as it is. I think that would be really good. I have a couple of questions if that's okay in terms of... From where you're sitting, can you explain Swift check-in to me? Just like what the product is, what's the pitch?
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 06:48
Okay. St check in. So I would like to know, what, like, are you as a customer or are you a potential customer or a.
Sachee Perera | 07:01
I'm a potential customer and I just want to get... Yeah, and you're trying to explain Swift check-in. Explain it as if I'm a customer or someone who's... Like you're talking to fundraising people in fundraising, right?
So when... Ask you what is Swift? Check-in? How do you explain?
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 07:20
Alrighty. So, I'm sorry, I'm not prepared for this, but I would say Swift check-in is actually construction operation management software, and with the main key focus areas in timesheets, scheduling, job posting, and budget management.
So.
Sachee Perera | 07:46
Cool.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 07:46
So that's what I called for, so check in.
Sachee Perera | 07:49
And what are the main problems Swift check-in solves for Lozer?
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 07:55
Okay, so st checkke in. Ideally helps it. It's ideal for, the folks or the groups or industries who are really struggling with managing the laborers, their check in and check out like the signing and sign offs. It really matters in terms of lab costing.
So it really S chan helps to, SE chicken helps with the, prevents the manual entry of the Excel sheets. Helps with, labor costing, labor hours. Yes, yeah, I'm so sorry.
Sachee Perera | 08:39
Okay.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 08:41
Yeah, I know that it is not an ideal answer, but yeah, I'm... yeah.
Sachee Perera | 08:47
Look, there's no right or wrong answers. I'm trying to extract what's in your head as quickly as possible.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 08:53
Alright. So if it is a customer then I have to actually really think, you know, because I have never come across. But as such, just overall, if I would say. So SOF Chicken really helps with the digital check ins.
For example, if the industry is not. Or the. If your team members or if there is no system in place for the check ins, sif check can help with the digitalizing the check in and checkouts, which ultimately helps.
Sachee Perera | 09:21
1.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 09:22
As I said earlier, hours really matter because if there is one or two extra, then that means money is leaking from the accounts or from the organization.
So, Shift Check really helps to prevent those leaks with the scheduling part. It helps with putting projects in time and in place, preventing project overruns. Yes, no.
Sachee Perera | 09:57
CO Now, just coming back to the competitive analysis. Based on the team's work that the marketing team has done and the work that you have done, what sets the unique value proposition of Shift Check compared to Deputy, the other ones, just like the top ones that come to your mind.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 10:25
Okay, so, I would say with the Deputy first. So with the Deputy, it's a generalized one. That's the main. So, it is. It is it's a times sheet software, but it is it doesn't completely fit under construction. It can be fit air new everywhere, but when it comes to Swift check in, it is really construction and construction trade associated specific.
Sachee Perera | 10:51
Y11.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 10:51
So that's the first thing I would say when comparing to Deputy. Then, the second one is, it's really intuitive and user-friendly. So I have used Deputy, but I found it looks simple, but it is the user experience with Shift Check. Check in when compared to Deputy is much better.
That's what I can say. With Deputy, you aren't able to do a job costing or labor hours costing, definitely can be exported, but with Swift Check-in, the budget management and the job posting can be done in a single platform.
So these are three single unique selling propositions when compared to Deputy and Asana. I would say, yeah, it's such a super poor software, but what I would say is it's really costly.
Then it is mainly built for the builders or the general contractors, but it can help with the subcontractors as well. But with Swift Check-in, we got the subcontractors specifically in mind. We got part of it for the builders and general contractors,
but with Swift Check-in, it's more focusing on the subcontractors and trade-specific, and then more intuitive than Asana. In terms of cost, I have her, like, assigns monthly or yearly subscription is like it's overkilling.
But with Swift Check-in, it's really affordable and friendly.
Sachee Perera | 12:40
Cool, and so you mentioned subcontractor, right? And the main builder, so, Current Group, they would be a specialty subcontractor, right?
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 12:48
Yes. Yeah, S-SLAO or Y- yeah.
Sachee Perera | 12:53
Silco would be a principal contractor or like S-LCA, not S-LCA. [Laughter].
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 13:06
I feel like CO is a subcontractor, and then another subcontractor using subcontractors underneath.
Sachee Perera | 13:14
YP Cool. And, from where you're sitting, you're saying we're not looking at the main contractor or the principal contractor and the general contractor, that's not the type.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 13:27
The thing. Yes. So from. So where the product is as the product is going and when we are trying to put like when we are trying to find the ideal, you know, the product market fit. What we found is this, from the customer demos we've done recently. The BONY has run recently.
So, who are the subcontractors or the trades? We go, "They are interested." We felt like it was actually helping them eliminate their pain points. So, that's how we came to the conclusion that it will be more for the subcontractors. It doesn't say it can't fit the general contractors. No, it can fit the general contractors.
But I think that the complete product use will be... It will be more ideal for the subcontractors. That's what we are getting into. We haven't completed that hypothesis yet, but we are nearly there. I would say 80 to 90%. We are there.
But it doesn't say that it doesn't fit the other way around. It doesn't say that it doesn't fit the general contractors or the builders. But I felt like they would be into more commercial ones, and they would need much more features or things like that. I don't know. These are just our assumptions.
But yeah, we haven't come across those kinds of builders or general contractors in the demos.
Sachee Perera | 15:02
Yeah, you mentioned, the help sorry, the customer onboarding documente and things.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 15:10
Yes.
Sachee Perera | 15:12
Have you developed this after the trials from Silio and the current group, or is this... What have you developed that from?
And what are the lessons from doing that?
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 15:24
So alright, so initially we had tech documentation, and then we modified the tech recommendation to customer documentation. We full-fledged it as a part of it. Then what we identified was that the product was completely evolving, and the leads that were coming and their needs were actually different.
So whatever efforts we had taken at that point in time, we felt like it was becoming a waste. So. And that's what the first learning is. So we just stock that customer documentation initially.
Then we thought it will develop as we go, so that as I said, we'll have a base which matches the product ICP and then further. With that purpose in mind, we are building students.
So, I have completed all the app-side documentation for the current group, and then we have dialed a WordPress, the front-end team has dialed a WordPress. If she can help, and then we are in the process of putting those in the WordPress. I can actually give the access.
So it's just the basic. We have started it like two weeks ago. I can actually share the access with you so that you can go through and give comments on whether you can see whether we are going the right way. You can just direct us.
So this is just the app side, and then from the SAS side. So what our plan is, we are putting it into three groups: for subcontractors, contractors, or for admin uses. Then app uses, you know, three blocks, and then whatever documentation pertaining to app uses goes in there.
We are nearly completing that segment, and then now we are actually putting our heads into the SAS documentation, getting help from the tech team because they have been doing more developments and more changes recently.
So what happens is they do it, and then I tweak it for the customers and then put it in the sub. The sub can help website, not website, the press.
Sachee Perera | 17:34
Yeah. And do you get to speak to the customers directly yourself as well? Or is that mostlyw.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 17:42
So it's only Bonnie, and Bonnie is actually transferring all the knowledge. Then, based on that, I'm actually tweaking the things, putting customers in mind.
If I'm a customer, like, how would I...? It's like that. But in the future, the plan is that as we're getting more demos and things like that, Bonnie has asked me to sit with them, sit within, and then just to identify and understand things straight from the customer.
So I haven't faced the customers yet, but it's in the pipeline.
Sachee Perera | 18:16
Okay, understood. What do you think? What do you think? Okay, I have two questions. So what do you think is stopping us from converting these demos to sales? I know we had...
Yeah. What do you think? Is the main reason? The main blocker for sales.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 18:45
We've been asking these questions all the time, pondering about it as well. So from my understanding, we feel like the message to the audience has to be really clear, who we are really serving.
Then with their pain points. So that's what the first thing that I can say. The message has to be a little bit more clear. When you say... So if you're targeting one ICP, what are the ads going to be? It has to be specific as to be really specific.
Then these are the two things that we have to put our heads into. Then reduce the friction with customer engagement, for example, on the website itself. I think we have to do a real audit of whether we are conveying the message and with our potential customers, are they able to approach it frictionless?
That's the second thing. The third thing is, for a second, sorry. These are the two main blockers that I can see at this point.
Sachee Perera | 20:07
Okay, yep, I think that's a valid point around the messaging and the ICP. Sorry, I'm trying my best to get an understanding of the construction landscape.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 20:09
At this point? Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 20:22
Right. So we have the builders, the main builders, and then there are the subcontractors that then have their SaaS, right?
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 20:31
No.
Sachee Perera | 20:32
There's are electrical subcontractors and there are plumbers. There are the fit-outs and all of that.
So, what niche or which segments in the construction subcontractors do you think we should be focusing on.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 20:52
So when we say "subcontractors," we still have subcontractors in the US markets who have got the turnoff for the general contractors, big subcontracting companies.
So we are not aiming at them at this point. We are aiming at the small and medium businesses. So that means, one, I would say, five to more than five employees. More than five employees, subcontractors, whatever trades come under electrical, plumbing, landscaping, Edgeworks, roofing, and the list goes on and on.
Then there are the fit-outs, so these are the main ones, but whatever the SIMPRO ICP is, they are most in the field service, like the field management.
Sachee Perera | 21:39
Y.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 21:50
But if, you know, we can actually serve all those subcontractors, we can serve six.
Sachee Perera | 21:58
So if we are going up against SIMPRO or Fergus, which is a competitor and Tradify, right? If it's the same customer segment, what have you found or what have you seen and what have you heard or what's your intuition or the gut telling you around the differentiation between Fergus and SIMPRO, forget Procore.
I think that's not relevant to us. Yeah.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 22:31
Yeah. Yeah. So to be honest, this the competitor SIMPRO has actually we came to know that really recent. But before that, we have been thinking as our competitors like I'll pass, Assignar, I'll pass, Asana, Roomix, Neo Intelligence and you know, the like those platforms.
But in the recent when we started with Yellow Pages and the buyer and solely the simp pro SIMPRO has come up. But even though... So actually JF has actually put those competitors upfront in the competitor analysis just to get the traffic.
But until we had enough validation that Simpro is a competitor, I haven't actually really used Simpro or Fergus or Tedify by myself.
Sachee Perera | 23:26
Yes.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 23:27
So I am unable to actually give that answer right now. I still have to dig deep into it with Simpro, but with... Yeah, and then with Azina run from Mix.
So when I'm going through... Yeah, I haven't actually gone through that product as such, just from what's on their website and from the images that we can see and in the product tools and the guides that are on the website and from other software platforms like software advice and.
Sachee Perera | 23:43
6?
Yes.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 23:58
And just giving through going through the reviews. And then that's how like I developed the understanding.
Sachee Perera | 24:04
Four.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 24:04
I came to know that we still have many features in our Andro Mix shares, but they are a bit more... They're in the industry for the past ten years.
It's more developed, it's in-depth. For example, in Timesheets itself, it's actually really in-depth. We are getting there. We are not saying we are actually... We're getting there, but it might take time.
For example, with Azina, we got inspections, we got permits, we got... That is specific for the builders. Then the bill passed the same like on top of the sign-ons and sign-offs. The toolbox... The toolkits, permit... A bit of safety and more of the compliance part.
Yeah, more features in there. So yeah, we are getting there. I'm not sure whether I was able to answer the question that you have asked. But to be honest, at this stage, I am unable to comment on SIMPRO and Focus Centerfy.
Sachee Perera | 25:02
That's cool. I just want to quickly jump into the staffing because of the HR side. Sorry, my laptop. Let me put stuff on low power. Sandy, I know a little bit about it. It's Kabita, right?
How did you find Kabita? Did you go through an agency, or yeah? How did you start her?
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 25:34
So. So we're actually sourcing, you know, we got an office in India. And then how resources like we hire through LinkedIn. So everything is actually LinkedIn, linked in job ats.
Sachee Perera | 25:48
Yes.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 25:49
And we saw and then we interviewed the right candidate for what we feel is the right candidate for us according to the needs.
Sachee Perera | 25:57
One.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 25:57
So especially when we work in Australia, we need someone with international experience.
So we make sure that they have international experience. Yes, that's how we manage and that's how we found Kabita through LinkedIn.
Sachee Perera | 26:10
Sure.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 26:13
And you know, in India, there are versions and then we go through it. We take international experience, but previously we tried with one of the external agencies, but it wasn't actually much helpful.
Sachee Perera | 26:28
One.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 26:32
So, yeah, we tried the other way.
Sachee Perera | 26:35
And she an employee or a contractor?
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 26:38
She's an employee?
Sachee Perera | 26:39
Boy cool. Alright, so I want to ask you about how you found them. The customer onboarding the competitor analysis document is kind of what I think the main thing is, but yeah, I think that's a nice little intro to it sounds like you're doing a lot and everything, which is which means you have a good pulse on where the business is, which is good to know.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 26:56
Yes.
Sachee Perera | 27:14
Yeah, very good.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 27:14
Y yes. So yeah, anything else I would do you want from my side like I think have shared whatever I can with my within my knowledge.
Sachee Perera | 27:27
Yeah.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 27:27
Yup.
Sachee Perera | 27:29
I wanted to talk a little bit about the fundraising and all that, but I think we can leave that for now. I want to get the basics out of the way around the product and things first.
I think that's enough for me today. I'll catch up with you next week for more things.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 27:44
Yeah alright. I got another question for you.
I know you have just started, but how do you feel about the ride with the Swift check-in? How is it going.
Sachee Perera | 27:58
Yeah, I've been going through and listening to lots of calls. Going through the different HubSpot and all this.
I think there are some very quick wins we can get. Very easy ones, but there's a bigger challenge around the competitor, the product differentiation with the competition.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 28:22
YP just add it is there with a unique selling point that you mean yeah or.
Sachee Perera | 28:24
Yeah, and what do we focus on?
Because there's a lot that's happening and... Yeah, look, it's still very early days, but because there are lots of different subcontractor types, each one's going to be a little bit different.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 28:39
Eight.
Sachee Perera | 28:44
And it's like, where do we start and what do we do now? What do we do next? We do later. What do we say no to? Even though it looks really good and even though it sounds really good that we should do it now, what are the things that we should say no to? What are the things we should stop doing?
And what are the things that we should start doing? That's what I'm trying to get a better understanding of.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 29:10
Understanding him.
Sachee Perera | 29:11
I think it was only yesterday. Today I've got the full opportunity to get unblocked and listen to calls and do all of that.
So, I'm feeling quite good about getting an understanding on it. But I can see some very easy wins that we can have, especially on the sales side, to get more conversations and to get more demos. Yeah.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 29:40
Yeah alright, that's great to know actually.
Sachee Perera | 29:43
One.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 29:44
Yeah. And really looking forward to your comments at the end.
And just the roadmap. Like we are really. We're really looking forward to it.
Sachee Perera | 29:52
I think by the end of this week, I'll have a relatively decent idea. So, it'll be more refining it and having more sessions with you guys and putting together here are here's what I've found or here's what I think or his.
Yeah, it's not going to be a final one, but we'll progressively build it as we go.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 30:17
Yeah, that sounds great.
Sachee Perera | 30:18
Yeah.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 30:19
Yeah, okay, thank you so much, Sachee. And, yeah, I'll try to share that. Do you want the link to the customer documentation and other things as well? The marketing side as well.
Sachee Perera | 30:34
If you have it all in one place. Yeah, true, but the one that I'm going to look at this week is the competitor and all of that.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 30:37
YP.
Sachee Perera | 30:46
Yeah.
nisha.george@dibasys.com | 30:47
Yeah alright, got you. Okay, do you want to continue? Yup, thank you so much, AI, and have a great evening.
Sachee Perera | 30:53
Thank you. Have a good day. See you.


===== End of swift__intro_meeting_with_nisha_transcript.txt =====

===== Start of swift__intro_meeting_with_sandy_transcript.txt =====

Sachee Perera | 00:32
Hey. Good morning.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 00:34
Hey. Morning. Mary, I'm doing very good. Just had my bri.
Sachee Perera | 00:35
How are you doing? [Laughter].
Sandy Balakrishnan | 00:42
I just matched the Australian lunchtime with the breakfast time back on 01:00 pm.
Sachee Perera | 00:47
Okay. I was actually trying to figure out how to call you on Zoom and then you called me straight away. So [Laughter] you read.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 00:59
The. was thinking, like, I know I've been in your same shoes. I heard a lot of Zoho while I'm in Australia, but I never tried it and I'm not exactly a great fan of it when it comes to the wrong thing. I like my text tack well and good and arranged to get it, but it's not bad.
I think, so normally by now you might have figured it out. Internally it is Zoho, but client-facing we have the combination of Outlook and that gives the things easy, you know, with the people too. We were really good, man, very really. I thought like, I did mention to him as well, like probably as you get a day just to figure his things out: where is what and everywhere.
Sachee Perera | 01:38
Did mention to you my so, like POs. I think it just... his yeah, where are you based right now?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:45
And he'll be picking from one side and then he can go to the other end with other people looking into the process and everything. Absolutely.
Sachee Perera | 01:56
I'm sorry. I know you're in India, but where exactly?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 02:00
So I'm in Kera same state where. Yeah, same state where, Bony is.
It's, he's like somewhere close to mid as down. So K is my state, so my hometown is. So my home country is India, and the Kella is my family, where my parents and everybody live. That's my house is everything, because I was an expert. My parents. I grew up in the Middle East, in Bahrain. I was born there.
Yeah, so I was born in Bahrain because my dad was an engineer there. He was working there, he spent his lifetime there, so I went to school there. Then when I was in sixth grade, my family just relocated here because there was nobody over here, so my dad stayed there. I came back here, did my schooling.
I did my bachelor's in engineering here, and I went to work in Southeast.
So I went back to the Middle East.
Sachee Perera | 02:59
So you to send the on the site yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 02:59
So I'm done two years into the engineering on the site. What, like I put on different hats. So I started off in the field pretty much like Ferman and just went on to being into the site management basically as a site charge running a project over there.
Sachee Perera | 03:16
Yeah because the.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 03:16
Then I got a bit of a quit with it because I wanted to explore.
For me, it was going to the Western country and getting a lot more of the processes and moving into the management consulting space at that point in time. That's why in 2015 I came to Australia.
So I was in Canberra for three years, I've done my schooling there. I went to a project at that point in time, project management was the thing in 2015. So we were the earliest badges we went into it. Bonnie is similar. He has done his project management, I guess, in the TS.
Sachee Perera | 03:47
Yeah like writing.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 03:49
Then I read the market.
So when it comes to Australia, there are things that work with its scale and with the size of the market.
Sachee Perera | 03:52
So it comes to rest, and so things getting the size of the markets you like, comments, or regional projects.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 03:58
S the figure is like digital transformation projects, which is where the market is headed, where it has a bigger market, whether it's sales, whether it's a transformation project, whether it's consulting.
Sachee Perera | 04:01
And so the market is as a big market. H yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 04:10
So in a short span of time, I moved around, interning with marketing projects a couple of them, and then I landed into sales in early 2018. So, I started off with FinTech, an accounting company, this company called Sage. Now they're like a third runner these days.
That's where I started. Then I got part of another startup. There's a US-based company. They do a lot of the sales outsourcing and run larger organizations.
Sachee Perera | 04:38
No, this was.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 04:38
So with them, I was a couple of years with Microsoft, and I had a few years with Cisco in the channel sales side, and then I wanted to check out the commercial side of energy sales because that's a huge market in Australia as well.
I did that a bit, but I didn't... My PR didn't come through in a timely manner like I thought. So, I transitioned back to India, as I said, there was a lot of trends when I was learning with the organizations I've worked with.
I have seen how the sales processes are getting moved around in the APAC region, between Australia and New Zealand, from a cost perspective, and all of those. I've been part of that as well and training up, moving around a bit of those. That's what my organization did. Eventually, they got acquired by Accenture, and pretty much our leaders had done the exit after two to three years, the mandatory thing after the acquisitions. They started leaving thing.
Sachee Perera | 05:37
And pretty much it's in yeah, thing.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 05:47
So that's the thing. I came down to India and figured out there's quite a bit of journey.
Sachee Perera | 05:49
And figured it out.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 05:54
I can see a lot of GZ CS happening here. But yeah, that's with me. But my heart is in Australia a lot because that's where I spend the best of my time. My friends, most of my networks, are pretty outdoorsy people. I'm like a beach person. I've gone to the beach two to three times. I'm on the beach, I go to the beach.
Sachee Perera | 06:16
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 06:18
Laura, a huge movie fan.
You see me once every week, probably I'll be in the theater, getting into the movies, all of those kinds of things.
Sachee Perera | 06:28
One.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 06:29
Yeah, that's a bit about me. We started, like a conversation with Bonnie through a friend of mine.
Sachee Perera | 06:31
Let's the. At the first time, he said.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 06:36
And things just organically just happened on a cube. I told them, "Okay, I'll step in and see what's going on here." We are with all of this here.
Sachee Perera | 06:44
Okay. And it's been, what, you've been with the business for two months now? Three, two.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 06:52
I will say around three because I came in mid of April. In April is full of holidays.
Sachee Perera | 06:57
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 06:58
Every single week is like three days. So we came in may, and then we I would say we got some ground started like last week of may. June was like a this month.
Sachee Perera | 07:10
Okay.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 07:11
And are coming into place. In July, there are a lot of things. The thing is that Bonnie is a first-time founder and a technical person, and I feel like, to see and to see the other side.
You will come to know, I think, shortly when you work with him. He and I think the marketing had a perception of how sales is and how the product should sell in the market to how it actually sells in the market.
So that is... That's been quite a journey. There's a lot of rewiring, remarking, expectations, and has gone through. But I would say it's around three months. I started some made of Apple. The interesting thing is, when I started, I already had the SD out there. She has been hired like three weeks back.
Yeah. So I jumped in and I got her and I got it. There was a good thing I did to bridge that gap because one, she is very young as a rope. That's another thing. She was coming from a B2B sales background and probably like teleco sales. One thing, she's based in India. Apparently, she had said she had worked with the international market.
So there's a lot of gaps in a bridging after going through with it.
Sachee Perera | 08:33
Yes, yeah, that's cool.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 08:34
But yeah, it's been close to around three months, we can say. What have you gone through? Yeah, Indian school, Bahrain, I started with the Sitra campus and then what is Sitra?
Sachee Perera | 08:41
You mentioned you were in Bahrain, which school did you go to and when was it okay?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 08:55
Yeah, Cera up to I think third grade and then I'm met to Isaton for fourth and fifth grade. That's a big... That's now the Knowledge City, right?
Sachee Perera | 09:04
I grew up in Bahrain as well, so 90-96 to 99.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 09:08
Alright, that's right. You what time like what time frames.
Sachee Perera | 09:15
Yeah, my dad was working for four years. Sorry, 95 to 2000, not 99. Yeah, 95 to 2000, which is... Yeah, but I went to second.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 09:29
A Sacred heart.
Sachee Perera | 09:30
Yeah, I crossed the road from the Indian school.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 09:31
Yeah he got more money then probably... Dad was doing better off.
Sachee Perera | 09:33
[Laughter] Well, I don't.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 09:37
[Laughter] No, n yeah, 90.
Sachee Perera | 09:40
It's the same thing. I don't know. It was a long time ago. I was very young.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 09:49
I left Bahrain in 2000. Sorry, I left Bahrain in 2000.
So yeah, technically speaking, I think you're coming off very close in age.
Sachee Perera | 10:01
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 10:01
So I was there. I'm born in 1988. So pretty much, I think, in the same school when we were in primary schools.
Sachee Perera | 10:12
Absolutely.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 10:12
I know soccer. Yeah, I know soccer. Hart cards are four to five times more expensive in tuition fees compared to mine.
Sachee Perera | 10:19
Who was it?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 10:21
Yeah, I'll tell you. It was costing around.
Sachee Perera | 10:22
I.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 10:27
It was costing around 800 to 850 Bahraini dinars at that point for a year.
Sachee Perera | 10:32
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 10:32
Indian School was 24 dinars a month.
So usually, the British expats... So you know that people who had the password from Australia, America, UK, they get treated in a different category from pay grades to everything. So those who are families who have the passwords from those kinds of countries, usually the company puts their kids into sacred hats and a couple of cool there because they carry the tuition fees.
Sachee Perera | 11:05
Okay, last.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 11:06
That's a norm. But I can be totally wrong. If you can afford it, it's a different thing. But you won't find normal much of the normal kiddos there because there is the monthly... It becomes almost equal to some people's salaries in that part in that time.
I know that I know very well, because my.
Sachee Perera | 11:24
I'm surprised.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 11:26
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 11:27
I'm surprised you remember that much. It was a... Yeah, you're almost my age. So [Laughter] it was a long time ago.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 11:35
It's a long time, and unfortunately, it didn't get much connection because those days, Facebook wasn't there?
Sachee Perera | 11:44
One.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 11:45
And was pretty much slam books and everything. But I know a few of them strayed back in Australia.
So in Bahrain, they led on their own lives there. A few came back, a few migrated like you to the US. And Australia with their parents. They made the transition. Yeah, so I had it in my back of mind, and look, my back calling was no Orientia. India is my place.
It's kind of home, but where you like to find your way back, right? So I came here, worked my way down here, which is good, which makes me multilingual. Pretty fluent in my local languages, but culturally, I got that Middle East alignment.
Then, like I said, I did my share there. Then I moved to Australia. Australia is much better in terms of a lot of things. People-wise, culture-wise, people do overlook that anywhere globally as well when I worked with most of the MNCs that I worked with, which is Disco, Microsoft, and all of these people. They're so focused and obsessed about the US market. They think the playbooks in the US work very well in Australia, and they undermine it because it is expensive but not expensive in the US, but the market size is small.
Sachee Perera | 12:48
Yeah. Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 13:01
They don't know that. It takes a lot of interpersonal relationships down here, building trust to actually make things go.
But once that is done, it is easier to move the needle. So, a lot of perspectives. I think the conversations came across and somewhat resonated with Bony and said, "Look, I know what it's like because I was in construction from 2012 to 2014."
I observed Bony in construction at that point in my life, all the way up. And I've seen how manual the things were, and I always kept wondering, why can't they have clouds? Like, using personal emails and all these things where you truly talk to these people today.
You know your timesheets. I used to sign up timesheets for 120 people towards the end of my career there. So, I see that manual things how it's going at that point in time. Google Suites are coming up. We tried to push and manage a bit of that, but you get a lot of pushbacks from the people.
Sachee Perera | 13:59
The was s.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 14:02
The people in the construction industry do have a certain mindset, but it has changed with the newer generations coming on.
That's fifteen around now, twelve years later. So, I think we picked off a bit of nerve. Is there like a kind of... I do understand we need to tap in, but the game is slightly different in Australia, so a lot of things.
Sachee Perera | 14:21
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 14:24
Yeah, that's bit me. Probably I just get to know how you are, and apart from what NA has told, just get to know how you are. How did this come And.
Sachee Perera | 14:40
Yeah. I'm actually supposed to take at least three to four months off on a holiday, but I spoke to Bonnie a couple of months ago because I was leaving the business, and I was like, "What do I do? I'm going to
get bored, so I'm leaving the business.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 15:00
Yeah, he.
Sachee Perera | 15:01
Okay, let's go and find something there. I was talking to Bonnie for some time, and then he was looking for a head of sales, I think.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 15:09
No.
Sachee Perera | 15:10
I think, just the conversations. It was very similar to what we did in our core plan and the previous business, specifically around the time sheets and whatnot.
So I thought this was interesting. I think the business has a very good minimum viable product here. We just need to figure out how to take it to market a little bit more effectively.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 15:38
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 15:43
I'm
been... The last couple of days, I've been trying to get up to speed on the construction industry because I'm not from the.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 15:52
Nine.
Sachee Perera | 15:52
[Laughter] It's really good to hear that you are actually signing off on the time sheets yourself.
So you know what it's like to be on the other side, Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 16:01
Yeah, I've been on that, not just time sheets. I used to do drafting in AutoCad. So I learned it way back. I used to do drafting in AutoCad. I learned it off pretty much because I grew up with it.
My dad was in engineering, and that's what I was surrounded with automation. SketchUp back in that time, I used to do all of those kinds of things before I transitioned here.
Sachee Perera | 16:26
No.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 16:29
So I know how much time-consuming it is.
The time in business is money when it comes to construction because in Australia, especially, they are not cheap. They're way more expensive than in your average workers.
Sachee Perera | 16:37
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 16:40
And, to waste time. Construction workers know if you don't guide them properly.
It's just like sometimes, even in sales, that's what I find. If you don't have people who are just self-accountable and you have a sense of direction, what are the top-level goals, and how can my small-level activities align with that? Same goes in construction.
People will come and stand there and stare until the founders tell you, "Okay, get this thing and do this thing." If there are any blockers, they get stuck. So, in part of the time sheets, the punch lists, what he was working on, he said that the compliance spot, we don't move that much these days, because we want to focus on one area, but yeah.
Sachee Perera | 17:24
So if you're from the industry, right?
And you're seeing, you're playing around with the product, you understand the product. Now, what do you think is the key problem it solves? Like.
And for whom? From your. Experiencey.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 17:44
Right. That's like a million-dollar question right now. I have faced when I came in. So, on the first day when I came in, I was talking with Bonnie. The thing is, I asked him to show me the product.
Right, because I chose to jump on board seeing the product. Nothing more like how things are going, what things are going. Because I want to see it from two angles. One, I had done this work in the past. A bit like the work we do, the second part is that I had in project management, I studied and I have a circle of friends who are obviously active in project management. They are like typical project managers.
So, I want to see from an angle what that looks like, what's relevant and what's not relevant. What is fluff, right? Then the sales point of S is like I like calling out fluff as early on as... So, when I look at the product, I was trying to understand what the founder's vision is.
Okay, where? Why Bonnie, you built this product, so what led you to build this product? Okay, we know, we all know. I feel this is more than an NVP because I have worked with startups in the past and I've seen products demote when I was part of the Microsoft Startups program. Leading things. Product is more than an MVP, but what led you to come to this where yet why are not be able to take off from where we start off and it took around two months after that to actually get hands-on into the product to me to play around.
So I had to go pressuring him for a bit. And very lately. Maybe just last month when he actually got access to the software for me to go around and say they were having some things they need to set in the background and all of this from my understanding, the product is more than an MVP, it has so many levers in it.
But if you take each individual module, there is no depth. It is for me, like, and I'll put it out blunt, because I have different stakes around it. It looks like it's the jack of all trades, but the master of none.
That's what the product looks like right now. Okay. And that is because when I'm joining the company, we have gone multiple iterations. The messaging was an all-in-one software to replace everything, alright, kind of thing. That's the idea that is in Boning's mind, marketing mind very fixated.
That's all in software to solve all of those areas, project management, scheduling, all of these timesheets and all this small timesheets schedule that's recently developed, all in one software dealing with all of these. The value proposition. You're going to replace established software in that space.
Maybe like Procore or maybe Autotask, Clouds or Deputy or Buildpass. You're going to replace that at a fraction of the cost, right? That's what the S and messaging I can get from the founders and find the marketing and to validate that, the origin of the software itself. How the software came into place. I hope he has told you that journey, right?
Like they started as a signage company. They started working with a TAFE, like doing a project scoping for them and found that they have a peculiar case where there is theft of manpower hours. And based on that, they built this software.
If this software has to be implemented for them, it could have probably saved $500,000 a year, right? So that's where it started off. Okay? Now, what we are right now is a product of what we see all of this.
So when I look into the software, my first instance is because I spoke to project manager friends of mine, who bra and always worked in this and they say we are all working at Procore and all of this. The thing is, where is our super strength if you're talking about project management and scheduling? Pretty much anything in the market, well-funded things like Monday.com, Notion, all these guys are out there as players, forget their traditional players.
So we can't see head-on with them. Right, because it is like we are very aggressive. We get in the market, we get in there. Then what is the strength individually in this space? And much more recently, when we started talking, we found customers who were resonating with timesheets and from timesheets, they scheduled the next level of scheduling.
So that is how we got our customer. We started working with them. The second customer is very much similar contractors in that space. Bonnie started slightly modifying the software, focusing more on those areas.
Then, when you started sensing that it was slowly working, let's start working on that kind of persona. So that's a journey. Now I fail the timesheets. With the last two months of whatever efforts have been done in the software side, timesheets area has improved. Now we can call that our little bit of a key highlight, the timesheets.
Maybe we are very close to Deputy in the consumer space. So this is my take on it. The project management side, the flip side is, yeah, it is a software, it is project management, it is efficient. All of those are there. The flip side is that project managers are very good. Most project managers are very savvy with Excel, Excel sheets, and English. They run a lot of the projects in Excel sheets. All the people I know are very savvy. They run all of those, and you get templates on run-off in Excel as a Gantt chart, right?
Then that's the product side. The product was built in mine for enterprise business with enterprise prices. That makes it very profitable when you sell the software to our business as if check in.
But they're like Bonnie, and probably even the marketing side, they are highly underestimated how the sales and deals work in an enterprise space. The time that is required, the multi-threading that is required, the hand-holding and on-site that is required to get that in through...
So I think the first instance they had a hand-burn running with Taif, probably spanning around eleven months. That's what brought it into... Let's try it in the market. When they are in the market, the mindset is we will sell it like an SMB, but the kind of clients we want to sell it to is mid-market.
That's how I understood that when I came in. And a fourth figure. So I can see the kind of sequencing email sequencing the clients that have been shortlisted and queuing that has been set for the marketing. You're looking at 25 million to 40 million to EBO-kind of companies to 200-300 for owners, top-level directors in the sequence.
Sachee Perera | 24:48
No. Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 24:56
But, you took... I'm this is my honest thing. They are taking it as easy as you're selling like an S&P into those businesses, which is very different. You might know which because core plans for pricing tell me you guys are mid-market. Enable you're now way like an SMB thing.
Sachee Perera | 25:13
Y.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 25:16
So that's where I think they got stuck with it as a team changing their mindset. Okay, you guys, define if you want mid-market and ABO, you're targeting 25 million and ABO where there is a board of people you need to sell across the board, and it takes time, it takes handholding.
So they got stuck, and then finally, the benchmarks dropped. Okay, let's move into SMB, 10 million, 12 million. Now we have gone down for five to eight million. That's how we came into a location. So all this happened in the span of under three months. Moving around. I'm giving a holistic understanding.
What I saw, what's changed, what are the things that are deterring boring and things. So when I'm coming in both the marketing and Bonnie wants to book an equip demo in two weeks, sell the two weeks, finish off the demo, finish the trial,
and sign off on the contract. That's what's going on in their mind. That is typically a good SMB practice, sometimes even very short. Very short for an SMB we want to execute that with marketke.
Sachee Perera | 26:36
Yeah. It's not.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 26:38
That change management had to be managed, and I had two people I had to manage through that, and for that, they had to really see what's happening there too. There's nothing we the way we went at it.
So you're not going to get you're not going to sometimes get an.
Sachee Perera | 26:49
Not.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 26:52
Door opened in the first, second, or third week. You had to work your way through it. So there is a lot of realistic calibration that has happened.
In the meantime, what has happened is we start, we saw that a few customers are talking to us.
Sachee Perera | 27:05
[Laughter].
Sandy Balakrishnan | 27:07
So one of them is Current Group, and another one is Slico. And then these customers... So what they want, although the number of people in the business is small, they have four to five million dollars of business.
When I started to show them their trial, that's when this is my honest feedback. That's when you realize the product has to have gaps.
Sachee Perera | 27:31
Mar.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 27:32
So there was naturally a little slowdown that was supposed to happen. We had the discussion, we are ready to go. We started the trial. We had a bit of hindrance in the first day of the trial. We were very fast. We figured it out in three weeks, came back to him and gave it to him, and then he underlined. He needs myob integration. My integration to another week and there were small things that were stopping him.
So on the fly, we are the product is getting built. The story is driven by the customer that is going.
Sachee Perera | 28:03
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 28:04
So my point, there are a few things over there. There are three categories: you need to position it rightly, and you need to see how much time and efforts they're taking. Is it going to be definitely... It's not enterprise at this stage because that needs depth in the product.
If you sell into it, I understand that if it is mid-market, and I honestly feel it will be mid-market, that makes sense for what they are thinking around it. Then you need to give the time and process and try to segregate. Then if you're doing SMB, that is more of a scale business. We can start working with it.
But I do feel the cost of acquisition at the beginning might be a little more. And then as gradually gets readjusted. So this is a holistic thing. If you ask me what is the strongest right in the product at the moment, I feel it's the timesheet. I wouldn't even jump to scheduling. With the kind of work they have put in the last one and a half to two months and the narratives, various timesheets, project management and all. I feel it is still a bit of fluff. That alone can't go and transform the value into space. What you're working for if you have to replace Monday.com or if you have to displace Procore...
These guys, project management... I used PrimerWare. I've been trained in Primer long back. Not now.
Sachee Perera | 29:25
He.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 29:25
I know how much of depth that has how much of microd element depth is there when they're when they run like large scale e PC or to key projects and EPC projects. The kind of depth that has in it that is in there.
So this is what I feel, this software at what right now data has come into it can work into time scales and schedule, time scats and scheduling, but it's a heavily computed space. It's a entirely, but you might have a different opinion. You have been coming and you have certainly grown something.
So probably I pick a brain on a you as well on itmm.
Sachee Perera | 30:08
I'm keen to understand the pain points here, like the time sheeting and scheduling. That seems to be the one that's most resonating from what I'm hearing. Right, you mentioned...
But then there's Fergus. There's obviously Procore. There's Asa that does a lot of.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 30:27
Yeah simp Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 30:32
So what is it that from what you understand right now, if we were just focus on the time sheets component, what in the Swift check in time sheets component that are do people why would people choose us?
Like, why would a construction company or whoever? Why would they choose Swift check in time sheet versus Deputy or Tanda or whatever or SIMPRO tradify pro Core or maybe not pro Core, you know, or SIM those ones.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 31:09
Right. So right now, at this current stage... One other thing is, we are a better value for money for them. The pricing based on the pricing we have, which is not the ideal thing we come up with in the front. We do have geo-fencing.
That is an advantage we had for a couple of months now. That might change very soon.
Sachee Perera | 31:34
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 31:35
So that is a huge advantage. What does it help us? It actually helps the company to know if the people are checking in on the site and they're physically present in the site. They can do that. That's my kind of monitoring. The people on the site, are they checking in, are they checking out?
Sachee Perera | 31:54
H.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 31:54
And all that other software does is here. That's one of the key highlights. We have that geo, we can define our site, we can see if the people are checking in and checking out on time on the site, if they are finishing the work earlier, have they overcoded the work, have they undercoded the work. It gives them a means to track those kinds of things.
It's a differentiator to most of our competitors. Most of them doesn't do that exclusively, but if we had done that now, it is a bit of a reactive kind of thing. We haven't gone to the real-time version of it. Real-time version is expensive. We had a requirement for the real-time version 1.
But like I said, it's easier said than done. The technical nuances of that, that's a key advantage there.
Sachee Perera | 32:39
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 32:42
Secondly, our interface, our interface and UIs are pretty simple. There are a lot of software that is simple, but I pretty much... We have a clean UI compared to our websites and all the things that we have, our UI is pretty neat and clean and easy to use. Self-explanatory. We don't have created much of a guide and all of this, but pretty much self-explanatory. Get to people, they can work it.
It's pretty easy once configured and running. It is pretty fast. The conferring and figuring it is a little slow. Logans. I would that's initially I seen I given that responses. But one is that it is pretty easy and fast to use.
There's a couple of things.
Sachee Perera | 33:24
How long does it take to confyt?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 33:28
The configuring doesn't take much time, but the first time logging in and the second time logging in, initially it was taking a bit of time. It was not smooth. This we slightly noticed when we got the first customer in the mobile variant. The reason I say that is at the moment we don't have an app version.
We have a browser version that opens in your phone.
Sachee Perera | 33:52
Okay. Yep. Got Gotch.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 33:54
Right? So imagine doing booking, imagine doing woolly shopping on a website in your phone and doing it in the woolly app. That's the kind of difference. Not every everyday has the latest software, latest drive kind of software as a phones that is working and maybe all forms.
So it varies. I gave them feedback around that pretty much. Bonnie and all of these people and Android people. I use my Apple phone. I'm very... I use that ecosystem. So when it comes across slightly different, I can know because we have a standard for apps or we have a standard for how it functions, but those are small things.
But if you take a top thing one, it does most of the things in timesheets. What other apps it does? Secondly, it's pretty intuitive. It's easy to use, easy to get on. One's running cost one, at the moment, those who know the value of it, it runs out to be pretty cheap for them because most of the other companies and I do can see them where they are coming from. They are funded companies when they are funded. The unit tech economics, I mean, goes in a different direction. A lot of the things are add-ons. The number of users you get charged for, the more people you have in the system, the more sites you have.
Sachee Perera | 35:14
Y.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 35:17
System system... We haven't put any blanket limit over there. We are slightly open there at the moment.
Sachee Perera | 35:23
Right.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 35:24
With. told them to keep some fair policies. We can work through that, in renewals and all of this, or until we come and run companies of that size, right?
So we work out to be very cost-effective for them at the current model. So these are some of the things that come across them.
Sachee Perera | 35:44
2Y1.

And second thing is, timesheets are only a part of a thing. From timesheets, the businesses can build the whole other things.
From Pris, they can go into scheduling, and from scheduling, they can take into high level and go to project management. Other softwares are not at the moment. I'm not capable of that. I haven't reviewed them for a very small time. I need to get access and review all of those.
So that's a different thing from what I've seen with Deputy. We work with it. Those are not that easy in there. That's not their core area, so they don't dig into it. So our software helps them to scale.
If it's a small business, we can give them a hand with us. Start off with timesheets. They can work down to scheduling in our software, and then they can gradually go to a project management level. Admin work can be drastically reduced.
It's not just about taking time sheets. Overall, admin work and getting a bird's-eye view becomes easier for them. So these are the top things where you are positioned then for our advantage. Australian-based businesses. We understand Australian customers and handle it a lot better. Things in our businesses are set in a way how it works in Australia where there are rotos of contractors engaging, all of those are there.
So this is where it is. Again, when I'm coming in, they had done a deep research on software. What are all the spaces? Nisha does it. She has an expansive list of 70-71. I've seen a couple of times these days. I try to gather it from the customer of what they are using, the kind of customer we are reaching, what they are really using.
So the narrative is slightly changing. SIMPRO comes up to be number one thing that they are using up. SIMPRO comes up a lot of times there are businesses that are using Zero and trying to cover this up as well. With Zero we are yet to understand. What are the other things? I'm pretty short of time. She might be manual for them. They're trying to work with Zero, YB and covering that.
So that's a few things. Fergus has come up one or two times. So these are the things we're seeing. But SIMPRO is quite right. Now, the Yellow Pages, what we're working with, typically you're looking at businesses. 344 to 5 million down trades. The real trade is the hands-on trades of Australia. Those people, a lot of them, are on SIMPRO. What you're talking about, there are a few in Fergus. Then they have very rare names coming like Arca X and all. They are like HCM, an extension of a pair SLA HR software that is com.
So there's one narrative of reassuming how it is. Then right now, I said, it's very important to understand what these guys have against the world I come from. We even use battle cards, but if I need to set the value cards and set that because we need to move into a cell motion, we might be replacing or we might be competing. We need to kind of understand who the competitors in that space are, as in who is the majority they're using.
Then probably we need to set the narratives because that'll be a hard-core selling notion at the moment, the way it is, the way Bonnie is envisioned.
Sachee Perera | 38:51
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 38:56
They haven't generally factored that into it.
They thought it's like this is my first instance with that, like two months of what I've seen. When you're going through it, there are customers there just maybe working with Excel and all of those. They don't hire other software. We are the first one probably calling into them.
Yeah. So that they are coming on board and joining this and seeing this getting WOD in the winter on. But in reality, it is that a lot of them has some parts of some software. Some of them, contrary to what we think, they have a very expensive software as well, like Procore and these ones, but they're not probably using it like for a compliance point and just keeping the software.
I know how it is in the construction. We had to keep some software for compliance, like if you had to submit drawings and get approvals. We need to have Autodesk drawing licensing over here. But we are not going to draft or make changes.
That's how we use it. So if you right now fail in the last one month, timesheet narrative is slightly working with the space we have moved into, but we have to move into a very strong selling notion.
So I would highlight timesheets. I wouldn't give too many brownie points into project management or scheduling in that space.
Sachee Perera | 40:20
You mentioned it really important there.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 40:20
And H2, good question. The Yellow Pages motion started early, first of this month, so we are just on the second week of it.
Sachee Perera | 40:23
So you're not coming across a lot of people that are just using pen and paper and spreadsheets. Most of them have... Is it more than 50% of the people? Through Yellow Pages, for example, are using some sort of system? Or are you... Is it like 50?
Okay.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 40:53
Okay, so for 130 contact companies, we took in a little effect. 50% of them are in IVR automated IVR. I'm not talking about the you can go in plus one, two, three and can talk to sales customer success.
So we are only able to talk to very small texts. Around 2015 to 20 people have actually spoken to us. Forget the point of contact decision-maker, anybody who has spoken to us on the call.
So, it's a very small subset at the moment. To actually get it, if you take from that, let's just say around 20 or something at the moment, it looks like 20 to 30% are the people who are like spreadsheets and on Excel.
But here's the thing: these people are extremely small businesses. That's what I'm trying to understand. One person to five people. Why would they need this software when they are literally like our business, our C-suite people? We talk to each other.
So, why would I put a complicated software in place? I send him my TE sheet. He sends in his TE sheet. I'm trying to understand this because the subset is very small, calling the whole people like that with a small subset, I think it is a little dangerous.
So, I thought, expand the subset. Let's take the whole month. In a month, I would be at least able to get across 300 to 350 accounts. Because on one side, that account is getting somebody scrubbing manually and making that account fade it into the backend, right? We have a person over here who's doing it.
So, that is what is happening. There are people. To answer your question, there are people. At the moment, maybe ten to 15 at the max, 20 people in Excel, Timesheets, and no particular software in place.
Sachee Perera | 42:38
Yeah. How can I see the... See that list of Yellow Pages contacts and the progress, like the names of the companies, the contacts? Is that in HubSpot? Or is that in Dialpad Or.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 42:54
So that is maintained in an Excel sheet. Do you have a... Okay, you have a... I'll just share that. You'll be able to see that. Okay? Just shared with you.
I'll just quickly give me a moment. We'll be able to screen share and show you what you're looking at, and I'll tell you why it's
run in an Excel in a bit, so this is the sheet. Alright, so Kavia is working directly on this sheet. I kept it simple because we are not running into a CRM yet.
So you got your companies over here. Normally, when this list starts, it's pretty clean. You don't get first names and last names from various scrubbing and bringing it in. I had done manual enrichment as well, just because it's Cellar Pages. These are the numbers, some of them she has populated. You get your suburbs, you get your emails, and you get your phone numbers. Most of them are the generics, and we are segregating the categories here. What kind of industries they are based in and then the basic, what do you require? A website, pin codes. You'll find the call notes over here, but you're going with it. Have given like a call item number.
If it's a first call or second call or third call, keep updating on it and this is email send. This is if it's a decision maker. It's easy to know if it's a decision maker and it's in a drop-down, which is still an admin. You'll get it.
If you have captured the admin names, it'll be there. Of course, there are demos and all of those that are there, but this is how that sheet runs. Okay, now there's a second sheet. These are calls that have been totally disconnected that we are working on later. Then there is the data.
If you go to the data tab, they have segregated so this keeps updated. We keep updating that. So, there's a rejected list of contacts, then there are gatekeepers and computers. So, these are people who spoke to us, so they want what you asked for. You'll probably be finding it over here like most of the day, most of the week. We keep updating it over here. What do you spoke to? What's the software where they are at? You'll get that from here.
As much as we are, we are collecting the name even if it's an adman who we are speaking to. We are at that point. This is the white list of IVS that happen.
Sachee Perera | 45:39
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 45:39
So IVS, like I said, a lot of them are full voice banks or absolutely automated, which makes a large number of them.
Sachee Perera | 45:48
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 45:49
Then we have a slot for bookings. We keep updating there.
These are invalid numbers. I give a round of enrichment myself. If it's possible, I keep it. Otherwise, I'll just gradually eradicate it at the end of the month. Just doing a bit of drilldown on what the numbers look like. This has to be updated because I have just given her a new list straight to it.
So this is pretty much what you're looking at. Does this help you?
Sachee Perera | 46:17
Yeah. And are the calls being recorded where you can hear the conversations or not? Really?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 46:23
So all calls are recorded. So I have put a system in place so all the calls are kind of recorded. I use Dialpad. So there are two things. I can download the calls and I can put it, into a folder. Or I have set up the system where you can hear the calls.
Sachee Perera | 46:41
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 46:41
Like most of the call, say, by default, it is recorded. It will. It will, read out the mandatory thing.
Sachee Perera | 46:49
Four four.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 46:49
So by default, the calls are recorded. A lot of them. I have created the disposition list. A fairly decent disposition list to say like if it is connected, if it's a gatekeeper. When you have the plugins later, we can organize that so you can find the calls over here. Which one do you want to go and grab?
If you want to grab a bunch of calls, pull them out. I can pull out a bunch of calls because that's how I shared it over here in sales calls. When they wanted a couple of calls, I started putting it here so I can bring out the calls.
It's not too much of a hassle. I can just download a whole bunch of calls and put them over here. Then you can see them. At the moment, they are not mapped. It is phone numbers, so you'll have to cross-match the phone numbers. We'll need to get the licenses up and we need to connect them in the CRM. Probably this will take up as a connect, but this does it. You can find the calls over here, you can download them, you can listen to them.
Yeah, this is how I'm capturing it. When I came in, it wasn't... They never had any recordings. They were using sales agencies. They were running it themselves. This is ground zero. What software we had, they never knew that, so they were using support licenses. There's no recording, anything.
So then it took literally four weeks to go through the dialer and set the dialer in the first place. I was doing all of those over there so that I wanted the recordings to be there so that you can look back into the recordings and plan accordingly.
So my early coaching for Kavia had to start off from there as I can do a call listening in as well. I've been doing that with her in the beginning.
Sachee Perera | 48:32
And have you.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 48:33
She wasn't.
Sachee Perera | 48:34
Have you integrated HubSpot into the dial
you can have... So you can push the calls into HubSpot yet? Or is that still on your to do?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 48:44
That still needs to be done for that. We need to go into the pro-level licenses of that and we need to finish off that. I brought it up to Bonnie. I'm allowed to do that when that is done.
Sachee Perera | 48:53
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 48:56
The list that she's working on has to be brought into HubSpot at the moment.
Sachee Perera | 48:59
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 49:00
The Yellow Pages, it's a massive list. We haven't brought all of those into there.
Sachee Perera | 49:03
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 49:05
What we agreed on is we keep quality leads, don't flood the whole system with the leads. Ideally, I like it to run from the CR.
That's what I want to go with it.
Sachee Perera | 49:17
No.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 49:17
But I was working in the beginning, when we were looking around different CMS they want to work with so who they want to do this. There was HubSpot who was already there. The agent was very slow when she was going to work with that.
We are at a space at the start of Excels, the fastest way to do it.
Sachee Perera | 49:33
One.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 49:33
I can take it anywhere. When it's an L, it's a matter of pushing and pulling into the CR, right? So what I did right now is if there are leads like yesterday, there was a decent call.
I'll just probably give you the recording as well, so that'll help you. That was a decent call. What I did is I pulled that from there and I created the account here. Am I still sharing the screen?
Sachee Perera | 49:58
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 50:00
Get a second.
Right, good. So this is what I've done. Yesterday there was a decent call. There's a chance of a meeting getting booked. So I pulled that account and created it under HubSpot. I have done the notes, free studies, and accounts. Everything over here. We used HubSpot itself to send the emails because I can see the trackers all over here.
Sachee Perera | 50:30
I.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 50:31
So that's what we've done. So ideally, if a good lead is working properly, if it's a warm lead, I can bring it over here and maintain the whole activities down here. So I think that's a transition kind of thing I'm doing with her as well to come down and work from here because what I felt there were many elements moving when I came in with tellers and this. Now when I started HubSpot itself, everything was trying to figure out over there very slow.
Sachee Perera | 50:47
Okay.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 51:01
She might be able to get eight or nine ACS engaged, and we wanted to go through a massive list.
So I said, "Alright, I'll get you Excel, you get the volumes, I'll figure out the remaining.
Sachee Perera | 51:11
Y Yp.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 51:12
First I need to see how that ends. So I did. That is fast for her. Then I just jumped into being like an IC executive founding iconic.
I will build it in the CRM it.
Sachee Perera | 51:25
1.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 51:26
And now these days I show her this is how it should be. This is how you need to look at multiple elements. And there weren't any trackings when I'm coming in, and that is surprising for me. The marketing hasn't kept any kind of... When I say there is demand, how is the demand? You spoke to 25 people. When you're doing this product design, is that what you consider demand or how did the demand came?
Sachee Perera | 51:50
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 51:51
So that wasn't Catcher. So that only happened like a month earlier when they put that trackers from HubSpot into the website. So now we can we have this. I think I'm pretty sure you have seen this kind of things before.
It's the buyer intend the people who are coming to our website. We have the people just love these are the people who are coming to our website in the last 30 days we sow who are visiting and probably, we can see which page they are kind of visiting like this is so there has been an ad scheduling last minute changes.
Sachee Perera | 52:25
Yep.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 52:30
So they are looking at that and they are coming to our pages. So this system was only implemented. I think it's the fourth week that just happened.
Sachee Perera | 52:37
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 52:39
We had HubSpot for a very long time. Marketing was a very long time. I was like, if we had this from the very early times, we would have known who was coming to our website.
Sachee Perera | 52:48
Y.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 52:49
Put a face to the people. Then we discovered, like I said, this is there. The people who are researching top topics. Now I'm not sure how accurate HubSpot is and how relevant, how real-time that data is, but from here you can see the topics that they are researching. We have created a filter timesheets and just for timesheets and scheduling. People who are being researched in this field.
What I do is I handpick the list, add it to the CRM, and from the CRM, I manage it. So if you want to see what I've done, I have seen they are working on timesheets and scheduling. I picked this account and I started working my way.
So again, they are a call lead. They're just in the market. The assumption is they are researching the topics. So I populated all of this data, put the face into it, started calling them and working my way up. How do you do mid-market just like that at the start going through and on each stage with them, working my way up.
So that has created a bit of movement. But it's all again, it's been only two weeks, you start working with it. I have seen people reading when it's very personalized and very relevant to run, so I'll show you one more.
Sachee Perera | 54:09
So is there a list of your shortlisted accounts that you're engaging with at the moment?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 54:19
Yeah, I'm curating it over here. There is a list over here.
Sachee Perera | 54:22
Okay. It's in the lists. Okay.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 54:24
Yeah, but it's an early stage. I would need a couple of days to come down to a meaningful one. I'll show you where it is.
So I put it under Topic research list ALR, so those are people who are looking for the topics in the market. So I started putting them in the companies under there, the businesses who are looking into these topics.
So that's the understanding. Out of that big list, I am just handpicking some of the businesses. So we came to an understanding. We will target businesses probably under ten million and keep it probably under 50 employees at the moment. Something that we can actually land a quick win in terms of sale.
So those kind of accounts, there are a few, one or two things that are large. That is because everything that comes up over here in the research list is not 100% straight. That is that they may come up like this blank, but when you go into that account, you realize there are a lot of people.
So this is some things that need to be removed. But this is where I capture it. I bring the topic research, try to keep it to the ICP, and try to bring it into the icon, and then start working on it from here.
So that's where I maintain my ones. All of this, we manually populated. I'm trying to find a way. I know where it is. SA does it, but Apollo, I'm working with Zapia to get that integration sorted. So this is what it looks like.
To do a bit of AC study, send it to the emails. If it's emails, then you start calling into them. So the emails that I sent are very personalized. I look at multiple social media platforms to understand that I know they are open.
So I'm working my way down. So that is the guy within the business. You know their profiles. So this is what I think you're looking after, right?
Sachee Perera | 56:18
And are you getting responses from these yet?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 56:22
Emails, no, but when I start slowly working into calls, I can see that it's moving.
I know they are getting opened, some of them. I can see they are getting clicked. So that is like they are noticing us. And some of them, tax accounting, the whole things, these things only started, like I said, it's been barely two weeks in, very early stages, but I find it is actually working from nothing happening to work working because everything is correlated at this stage, literally correlated, right?
Sachee Perera | 56:51
Yes. Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 56:53
And number one thing I need to say is that everything is correlated, but there has to be a strategy in even the correlation. What you are looking for is not into businesses that have been heavily sold out. Probably the businesses that have some buyer intent.
So this seems to have some intent. There is something we can relate to when you're going into the business and talking to them. So I find there is momentum. But it's like I need to work my way from again, admins to the directors and start coming.
So some of the examples of what I found as working in short time is... This is an account. They happened to visit a website for some reason and we started reaching out to them. There's a project manager we have sent it to her.
Then we started seeing we sent it to the next person. It is tied down to an event they were having. We can see they have opened it two or three times, they have clicked it two or more times. That means they have gone through the links. Now I'm trying to work my way that this software system will be able to show that if they are coming back and visiting our website or they are going to our pricing pages.
So we are doing a 360-degree approach to the customer. They're responding to emails, picking up calls, looking at the website, doing research, and creating a whole circle.
I have seen this method and used to do that in other businesses as well. The same thing, more like an A account-based marketing.
Sachee Perera | 58:21
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 58:21
So that's what it looks like. But then when that setting is done, I want to scale it up. I find that will be effective.
Yellow Pages, of course, the volume is happening there. Yesterday we had a customer. Yeah, almost had it. They almost said yes to it. So that is pretty good. I brought that into CR myself.
Those that are working and getting into warm leads, we'll bring it down here. We'll work it there for the time being, just to get the volume and things.
Sachee Perera | 58:48
Y yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 58:52
We are doing a lot of numbers. This is not just the list we had done. This is one of the lists we had done.
If you ask me, there were two, three different types of campaigns we had done in between, we are like there are a lot of pivots in a short period of time.
Sachee Perera | 59:08
Sandy, that's some phenomenal work you've done so far, like bring everything together.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 59:08
So yeah, I know that.
Sachee Perera | 59:13
It's a lot in a. In less than three months.
So which is? It is awesome to hear.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 59:22
The thing is, when I was with my... There were sales engine businesses, they were building X engine and all.
So, I was part of three to four pilot programs for Microsoft. I know it's totally messy. When you start from scratch, when I came in, I expected the same to happen.
Sachee Perera | 59:38
One.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 59:41
That's why I said, "Look, let me see what the forms look like." One of the heads... What I had was I'd worked with people. Kavia was very new and it's not her fault.
Right. We picked her up. She's a good person, but it's just she hasn't experienced what it's like to be in a beta web space. So, there's a lot of gaps that had to bridge at the time. Go back and... Right now she has come into that zone, okay? She can talk with admins.
The second hurdle is that now you have to work with Australian businesses. You know what it's like from calling from an offshore person from Australia, according to it. So, there are massive gaps that we have to bridge. We are to bridge two jumps. One, as a sales rep, you come into a market level. The second is you bridge that international seller level.
So, all of those are happening. I the first thing is, well, there's not been much progress in the demo. I would say the Solitude demos have gone in. The two ones are pretty decent and solid. I usually say they probably end of this month they get into their trials, they're moving in or... Yeah, sorry, yeah, Slico, yeah, current group.
Sachee Perera | 01:00:49
Is this, Cor group and LY? Is this current group and SLY? Current Group and SLY, yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:01:01
So the profile that you're talking to. Current Group is a Project Edwin guy in the business, but he has a high say in the business. If you take the top three people in the business, he is the three people running that SLY.
It is the CFO we are talking with. And it just happened that this June and July is the end of the financial year. You know how busy it gets. So they generally want to push it a little down with the Gena. So that's the thing that is happening down there.
So that's the two ones that happened. So we are trying to understand the kind of profile there that gave some signal. So what didn't work when you came in the first time? So the way of marketing did is I'll just show you where you're at. It'll be easier. I'm pretty sure you have got the access. Give me a se.
Sachee Perera | 01:01:56
Yeah. Okay, I'll do this at the end before we wrap up today in terms of access. But yeah, carry on. I'd like to see what you're showing.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:02:06
Yup. So we got here, so we got the Apollo over here, so this is where the marketing used to send. So this is what they used to send the emails and sequences and the kind of profiles they send.
Sachee Perera | 01:02:21
One.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:02:23
So this was when I was coming in, they were doing like four weeks sequence. So I waited out to finish two sequences. I don't want to disrupt. I want to see what's saving. There'll be a reason why they did what they did, right? Then you can work into it.
So these are the two things they have done in that time it took. There was a sequence of four emails already set with marketing. I think it expanded into May. The stats are in terms of deliveries and clicks and all, but there's literally no more than one or two replacements. There was literally no replacement.
The profiles they reached out to were in the Zillow and the owner and director of construction companies. At that point in time, they hadn't kept... These are the profiles they reached out to.
So this was May and pretty much in April. The reach they were reaching out to a lot of them. So a lot of them is easier. There's a mix. Now this is a mix of accounts. You can see the activities they run. Two sequences, from the marketing, which I came in the middle of when I was engaging. Then we did a slightly different sequence that is for project admins and project managers. That was a very tight one we did.
It's called Mint. Let me just share that as well. Wait a second. Says cost. Okay, I'll just share that one as well. That's fine. So this is where they used to do the sequencing. I'm using the same thing for the data enrichment. In terms of contacts and finding the people. Apollo is the source I go to, and the SA one is the personal one I'm keeping over there.
It's a free icon, but this is a paid one. We are using much of the contact enrichments if we want to do the sequencing that's happening down over here. And marketing is pretty much handling this.
There is a domain for this one. I think it's Nick. It's called the Nick. The email is set under the Nick. That's where it is going from.
Sachee Perera | 01:04:30
Okay, yeah. Lots of... Yeah, that very low in terms of responses from those cases. It slammed by these emails now. Anyway, so.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:04:44
That's a problem. Yeah, I mean, maybe you're a family. The thing is, the last two or three years, that space has evolved a lot.
Sachee Perera | 01:04:52
One.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:04:53
Automated sequencing is happening a lot. Emails and even LinkedIn, it is getting swamped. Not just over here, we've seen those things happening. No one rights and one second thing is, they were all core leaks.
So I think it's normal.
Sachee Perera | 01:05:09
YI just need to understand the product and everything a little bit better here, because, just going back to.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:05:10
You see that happening. So there are a couple of moving elements. I think your expertise helps us to figure out how to source those leads. When you were with CorePlan, you would have gone through similar things like sourcing those kinds of leads.
Maybe it's slightly different for you in mid-markets and ABo, right?
Sachee Perera | 01:05:41
Yeah, just time sheets and scheduling.
I think I need to go and jump into HubSpot and look at all of the emails. I noticed that I actually don't have access to it. Do you have super admin access in HubSpot?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:05:58
I have a super admin access here.
Sachee Perera | 01:06:01
I can't see emails or calls or anything, so you need to go and enable it.
I think it's for me to see emails and calls from C on.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:06:13
Okay.
Sachee Perera | 01:06:14
I can't see emails and calls. For example, in insurance building, I can only see the notes that you have left. I can't send for emails or calls.
If you. If you can help me with that access.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:06:31
Right, I can probably... I'll swap the access there. Give me a sign. Let me have a look at it. Alright, I'll make a point, I'll do that.
Sachee Perera | 01:06:41
Yeah, so access to calls, sorry, when you go, it'll show you tasks, notes, calls, email for every deal and the deals. I think I have the deal. I think I have access to deals that would be good for me to look at.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:07:02
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:07:04
Do you think you can send me like, the three biggest hottest leads that you're working on?
That is like not current group, not sl y the three horus companies that you think so I can shad and then do you have any meetings or demos coming up that you have booked?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:07:25
Not right now, none. We don't have anything. Maybe in this coming week we might be able to find the Stray from Kavia. We have one in LA, we just sent it to him. I brought it to CRM.
So we don't have any upcoming ones?
Sachee Perera | 01:07:41
Okay, that's fine.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:07:42
Yeah, we haven't any, we don't have any MQLs at the moment as well. But we'll definitely book you in. Not a problem anyway. We're setting in the Australian time definitely.
Sachee Perera | 01:07:56
Yeah, that's cool, and you can send me the recordings that you showed.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:07:59
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:08:03
I don't have access to OneDrive, I only access to Zoho. Maybe if you can just drag and drop that into Zhofiler.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:08:11
I will put in yeah, I'll put in a bunch of those into it over there.
Sachee Perera | 01:08:11
Al.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:08:16
I'll probably exclude the IVs. We say I vs. is pretty going there and listening to their voice mail.
That's pretty much it. Conversations. I put it there's mostly up over there. I'll just try and put it over there.
Sachee Perera | 01:08:23
Yes. Yes. And are there recorded demos of the product?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:08:32
We have.
Sachee Perera | 01:08:32
If.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:08:32
We two have.
Sachee Perera | 01:08:33
If you can.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:08:34
I thought Bonnie shared that with you. Recordings, daily check-in, trial set-up.
Okay, I'll put a note. I'll share that with you as well. We have current groups, and we have Slico, I believe. Yeah, we do have Slico, we'll have a look. They are in teams. I'll share that with you as well.
Sachee Perera | 01:08:59
And current electrical contractor.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:09:00
Okay, yes, they are an electrical contractor.
Sachee Perera | 01:09:02
Right?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:09:06
Yeah, we had a couple of meetings with them.
Sachee Perera | 01:09:10
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:09:10
So, in that course, the discovery happened in the demo calls. Because the way it was when I'm coming in, the way they wandered is like "book a demo".
Normally I do the qualification and all those but the process and all it can come in place. I just hold back the process for the same reason and not what the set of the whole CL met. So call and put in the demo.
But in the demo, I joined with Bonnie. I was doing the discovery in the call, and then Bonnie jumped into the demo, and Bonnie helped through that demo thing. So that's the first time I'm getting to see how the demo to the clients, what they're doing with it. There are a few of the old ones, the Bonnie shared with the customers. There are a few demos which Bonnie gave himself, as well over there.
Sachee Perera | 01:10:02
Okay.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:10:03
Yeah, we haven't created a deck for it because that is something that the process has to be slightly defined.
Sachee Perera | 01:10:09
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:10:10
The thing is, our demo at the point, both our demos include a demo plus discovery. Normally we do that discovery slightly earlier than this, but the way the leads were done at that point, it was slightly doing and checking into the demo.
Kendra was not at the point to even do the qualification kind of thing. So it was like, "Okay, make the booking in." It's her expectation that the Bonnie hiring set an appointment kind of thing.
Sachee Perera | 01:10:41
One.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:10:41
But I think that's something we work with. It's just two months. We'll work and create that process. I need to get the licenses, the higher licenses in HubSpot to set the stages in the trial. I did a two-week trial. I set the stages, and the workplace and dashboards.
So only come in sales subs, like the sales subro, like a lead. You go to the lead opportunity proposals and that kind of stages.
Sachee Perera | 01:11:08
Yeah, I think I'll be able to get a startup discount.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:11:08
Yeah, that's it.
Sachee Perera | 01:11:12
For HubSpot. That should be the professional plan, and but I think that's we need to do a couple of things first before we set up.
Yeah, time sheets.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:11:26
You it. Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:11:29
Yeah. All right, Matt, this has been really helpful. I am going to go and review the calls once you share them with me. I'd love to really hear what Kahoot is saying and what people are saying.
Listen to watch one more calls and into shadow the three hottest leads that you think you're chasing right now. To really get an understanding of where we are in terms of the product.
Yeah, Keen, I think we just need to dig deep enough to keep here.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:12:08
Yeah, just asking out of curiosity.
Sachee Perera | 01:12:09
And, yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:12:13
So how is it with the Core Plan? Is it something similar building up or... We came into a little later stage with Like.
Sachee Perera | 01:12:22
We were doing everything, and our product was, like you said, a jack of all trades, master of none. We really had to say no to a lot of things and focus on one area and just do that really well.
What I did was just do... Across the business, align everyone on the same vision of what we're going to build, how we're going to sell, how we're going to continue to build, what's next meter.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:12:54
Yeah. Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:13:00
And difference was that the competition was mostly really old school or pen and paper. So, whereas over here, from what you're saying, there's a lot of competition.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:13:20
It's, yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:13:21
Which is a good thing. Which means people should be more educated on the problem.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:13:28
So that's the thing, one of the things I'm really looking into continuously is one of the things I noticed in that segment, Norman has a majority in this segment.
Sachee Perera | 01:13:38
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:13:39
So if you take accounting in Australia, Zero is a leader. MYB is the second CKBOOK age the second space. If you take Cloud AWS, Azure GCP, some people have a vast majority in this space, so it's super segmented. Even pro core, they have like single digits solely, even if you look at it from what it is: pro core in the Australian market, in the Australian market, when you're looking at that segment, when you took all of the construction and all of this.
Sachee Perera | 01:14:03
Or globally?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:14:14
So that's something I've noticed. The market is like with a lot of people for different reasons. I think we'll get to know more closely when we work with it. That's something I'm trying to observe or understand. When we went into Yellow Pages, which is giving us information from grassroots level rather than we were going to the businesses at that point.
Sachee Perera | 01:14:33
Yeah. Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:14:38
I didn't make the change to run business, which is like what's working following the trend in those businesses like we have in place. We don't want to entertain.
Pretty much it's a standard thing. Even an admin would tell you that we have everything in place. We don't want to shoot an email. We'll pass it to that kind of things.
Sachee Perera | 01:14:54
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:14:56
And has come back as one such company. We had a demo, a project engineer business having around 25 million in revenue. The demo pretty much showed no interest to any part. I had to kind of jump in and guide the demo, around to find where she's picking the cues.
Sachee Perera | 01:15:16
1.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:15:16
But I feel like it wasn't qualified. I'd like to get that qualified in, but it wasn't qualified. One that was a lack of qualification. But at the end we came to know, let's say, the obvious list that we have, we do have Brokor at the top end. Then we have planning and scheduling software, Microsoft Project. All of those are in place for it. Timesheets like Deputy, Tradify, all of those are there.
But I think it is shaping up the narrative to timesheets and scheduling. Just take it from me, it has just developed in the last four weeks.
Sachee Perera | 01:15:49
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:15:50
And it stood, where it started originating and slaying to versus when you went mass, it didn't work. As an all-in software, we found one or two clients clicking on timesheets and scheduling, and when we put the trackers, we found people are researching around that.
Then we said, let's run a campaign in this narrative. So we planned around June a small campaign for just Melbourne, particular segment close in hand with marketing, and then Yellow Pages said, "Let's select.
Sachee Perera | 01:16:15
He.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:16:19
Let's source it ourselves, not rely on the platforms." Because if I have access to Apollo, I'm pretty sure there are hundreds of businesses that have access to it. The same list, and you're going to it. There's nothing unique about the proposition of those.
So I said, "Let's source it." Let's get it and source it from it. That's how Yellow Pages happened. Then we started putting it, and I found there was more valuable insight coming from it. Demos are one thing.
I'll get to the demos, I'll get to the selling part, but I understand that's what the customers can do. Can we get that customer? What are the customers like? What do they play with? Where are they stuck? What's the kind of revenue?
So this is the typical from mind. My idea was like, okay, they will be the typical businesses. Four to five people in the business making a million and a half million a year. The kind of trade is...
If you're in Sydney, you'll know the kind of. The people at Cera. You do this for all the builders and people like family businesses. Five, six cousins in the place running it. Maybe one, two, $3 million businesses they're running, but it'll be in hand in books and papers. The wife is doing the accounting, handling all of those, the typical Australian way.
Coming closer and working with Andrew in the later stages, we discovered that it's cable that they may have. Sometimes they have 20-30 contractors under him. They're working with just... By looking at their payrolls.
Sachee Perera | 01:17:42
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:17:47
Payrolls can even add up to one and a half million. That means that businesses are five million, even if they are 20-30 people.
Sachee Perera | 01:17:52
Andrew is from the current group or Silco?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:17:53
Yeah, current group.
Sachee Perera | 01:17:57
Current group?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:17:59
Yeah, in our very last meeting that came up when you were talking to me and Bonnie, we were sitting and just doing a little math. Okay, there are three people showing up. So that's the thing. Then the more important pricing thing, we had to push it a while to carry it out. That again came down early last month. Funny was I know it's the best thing, but having something in a vision of what the pricing and all, the segmentation of the features, how do you differentiate? Low, mid, high tiers, you know, because that gives us.
Sachee Perera | 01:18:35
Yeah. Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:18:37
For everybody, even the seller gives us away. This is the differentiation, whichever way we're going to go.
So that needed a lot of handholding, and you got it last month in the pricing. I think Bonnie had an expectation of different pricing, but that is a later thing. But you need to at least see it as segments. The reason I'm putting that up there is because until then, the story is very vast and open. I the problem. I told you like you understand like the jack of all trades, master none of the software. Then the narrative below that is wide and open. After one to three calls even with the Andrew till late we haven't said about the pricing.
Yeah, absolutely asked you twice. A pricing at that point in time. But we haven't Bonnie's come out with the pricing what it looks like. So we had to really me and marketing had to really push the price, come out with a price.
We will work the scales and esthetics, but we need something.
Sachee Perera | 01:19:41
Yeah, that's good to alright.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:19:43
So, it's like.
Sachee Perera | 01:19:45
That's very good. Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:19:49
So, the way he wanted to say is like, I get my first twenty customers and I'll come up with a pricing model for that.
Sachee Perera | 01:19:56
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:19:57
But the salesman in me could sense it. From Bonnie. Bonnie's original vision is probably each point the software is sold at least somewhere at 40K per customer and annually the least maybe 20K I felt. See that price is not a big provo in mid-market or the bigger businesses but in SMBs like it has to be envisioned in a different way if you want to get across the needle.
Sachee Perera | 01:20:17
4.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:20:25
They are they can.
But yeah, these are all moving elements. There were so many moving elements. But that's why I asked if it works. And one always compares pricing with I'll pass a couple of times he used to keep comparing with the US.
Well, core plan. The noise was there for a while. Hey, they're doing a thousand and above how they are doing it. But then I had a close look at following your customer thing when you guys had your first rise.
I think around thirty customers you go on the year. If I look from here to here, around 100 customers. From all the data I'm looking at, you got around 100 customers there, maybe more than that. This is only the new you can get outside, but doing the math, I can find they are probably mid-market spenders in that segment. You'll be okay with 100 customers because the billings from them are good.
So.
Sachee Perera | 01:21:15
Enterprise it was s enterprise H the producted in matter of two years.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:21:16
H?
Sachee Perera | 01:21:27
So yeah, which was very different. So we're serving SMB mid-market and enterprise, so now it's an enterprise SaaS, which is fun, but sales cycles are long, so, which is good, but bad, they can pay upfront.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:21:38
He? Yeah, I know.
Sachee Perera | 01:21:50
Cash flow is sorted today. It has been very helpful. Thank you.
I think I have quite a lot of information from you, and I'm going to hit you up later this week as well, if that's okay. If I can have a once I've digested a lot of the info from today. Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:22:08
Like, I know, I took it through a lot of things, but the thing is, from a sales perspective to another person, it's solved. It's easier to convey a lot of the things you can find what's working, what's bad, and I don't feel holding back information.
Sachee Perera | 01:22:19
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:22:25
When I came in, that's what I said. There's no history of what sales happened other than the two agencies being involved.
I told him, "Look, I want to bring it to a system and I want to be scalable." Thing.
Sachee Perera | 01:22:36
Do you have any, were there any calls? No calls recorded from any of the agency work. Nothing. Okay.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:22:47
No, that is my biggest surprise. No, I mean, if they had booked demos, the demos will be there.
Sachee Perera | 01:22:53
Hey.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:22:53
There were no calls at the end of it. They had a list given to them, and that's when I realized the hindsight over there. The first time I was talking with them, it was like ground zero.
Sachee Perera | 01:23:04
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:23:04
M and that is another thing. At that point, they said they have gone across thousand 800 companies calling them.
Sachee Perera | 01:23:12
Okay.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:23:12
And, for me, it's like, "You've gone through it." The day I'm coming in with the slide, the pitch just said that you are looking at 3000 and the total service will open the market. I'm like, "If that number is right, that is half of the market. Probably, it's a huge thing, mainly I was singing like so how and you'll run out of releases sooner than you think if that's the reality of it.
Sachee Perera | 01:23:29
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:23:37
So there was nothing. That's why the first thing I could put in place took time, four weeks because there were so many issues. The licenses were tagged to the agencies, and the agency people wouldn't talk to him. I had to come in and cancel the whole dialer, start a fresh dialer, and then move into the way it was set in the call centers where you do monitoring.
Sachee Perera | 01:23:52
Al right?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:23:57
And because for me, there is another way to coach. Effectively, to coach that she needed the hand-holding in the beginning. So the good thing is in the first month, one and a half months, we are testing a couple of dialers.
Sachee Perera | 01:24:10
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:24:10
But most of the calls we got in the camps were there. It is there. I built it for whoever comes in and takes over. They should have some references. The higher the licenses here, you can bring it into HubSpot, you can connect it across those. They are possible, but that's all in place.
Sachee Perera | 01:24:26
Sorry. How much does Dad cost you?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:24:26
And how much?
Sachee Perera | 01:24:30
Do you know how much DALL-E costing?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:24:34
$202 for two licenses.
Sachee Perera | 01:24:40
2I see.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:24:40
The base is $69. Then you need an add-on to do unlimited calls in Australia because the mobile phones aren't free. Yeah, at the moment, I haven't pushed them and jumped into any contracts.
I have kept all month-to-month, being very cautious around the cash flow and the things he wants to work around with it.
Sachee Perera | 01:24:54
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:24:59
And shouldn't be that. Okay, I pushed you guys into this plan and locked you for one year another year? No, I just modified the plans so that, in this plan, I can monitor.
It's fairly good in terms of call quality and everything. I have worked with RingCentral. It's pretty good. You might need to negotiate with them, but because we only need two or three seats, that's not even big enough for them to give us a price. Ford gave us a discount?
Sachee Perera | 01:25:24
Nineone.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:25:26
Has didn't put us into the startup plan.
The last time I spoke to them, it was $120 they were giving. Okay, let's give it $75. Well, they can't put us into a startup program because we haven't raised the fundings, so I just like hold my... I play it like, "Okay, catch."
Okay, let me then keep it into month-to-month. The problem yesterday I was looking for it. If I go up the hubs for the pro license, it is anywhere. Twelve-month commitment. So I thought I'd talk to Bonnie and say if it's a commitment, then talk to the agent. He'll get a discounted price and commit to it. He needs it.
If you want to scale, see it. If you want to scale it, you need some of the systems because otherwise you'll just get lost in the data and not make good insights. That's where I am at for me now. It's 20 to 20 accounts. Imagine, in a month's time I'll have 100 accounts there when I start.
If I'm starting my day as an iconic ex-hier, I need to see where I'm going, who I'm focusing. Right, that's the thing.
Sachee Perera | 01:26:27
Awesome, man. This is very helpful. Thank you so much for today. It's good to chat with you and hear from all the good work you've done and the key insights you're getting.
I think this is a good time to be in the business as well.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:26:40
Two absolutely.
Sachee Perera | 01:26:42
It's the most exciting time, which is great.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:26:46
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:26:47
Cool, I might leave you and skedadd and maybe I'll hit you up, you know, Thursday shit, it's Wednesday today. I might head you Thursday or Friday or something. Do you work every day? Or. Y.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:27:00
I I work in Australian times and then I just take a day off. In the morning I start, I just coordinate with Kaw, and if she needs a singer with her, then sometimes I catch up with her when she has situations where she works with sometimes. Today was a long call. We had a client yesterday, and I had to show her a bit more.
So that's how we go. Then again, you had to go through the construction industry. I had to do the same with her. So, I spent over time talking about this, "This is how it is, this is how that is." Today, she had a customer, and she was talking about integrations, and then I had to explain what integrations are to her. She didn't...
It's natural she doesn't know. It's my duty as a senior seller to understand her and how it works. Then I told her what APS is, why integrations are important, and how it can be a win for us as customers. He said, "I am very much in the dark."
I can't even imagine bringing it over here.
Sachee Perera | 01:27:55
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:27:55
So you need to know what integration is, how you can bring it over, what we can do in Australia, how partners handle integrations. How can we make that process easy for us?
It's called VND larger. It's a bit of coding and those kinds of things are there because, as a young seller, I have discovered this on the way, and people are showing me. So, that's how it goes.
I have a set SA with her. She sends me an evening daily report.
Sachee Perera | 01:28:25
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:28:25
I've been collecting that for the last two or three weeks. It's in the syn.
Sachee Perera | 01:28:28
Cool. I think let's jump into some of that information on how those operations work. Friday or next week, let's go over it. Man, thank you so much for your time. Have a good day.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:28:42
You too, Reggie. Have a good one.
Sachee Perera | 01:28:44
See you later.


===== End of swift__intro_meeting_with_sandy_transcript.txt =====

===== Start of swift__intro_with_boney_transcript.txt =====

Sachee Perera | 00:18
Bonnie, good morning. Can you hear me? You can hear me? Okay, yeah, okay, good. You have a so that is your actual office, you're not in a core working space or anything.
Boney | 00:40
No.
Sachee Perera | 00:41
Okay, cool. Wow. [Laughter] I didn't realize I [Laughter] see [Laughter] the term, yeah.
Boney | 00:48
That's our conference. So you should come and visit us. It's in a remote place. The nearest airport is two and a half hours away. So it's very close to... It's a remote place, but all the product engineering teams across the state come and stay near this place and work from here.
Sachee Perera | 01:09
Wow, very good. [Laughter]. What? What time is it? Must be really early where you are, right? 07:30.
Boney | 01:19
No, when it is 07:30, and when I work from India, I usually start at 06:30 in the morning.
Sachee Perera | 01:23
Yeah, okay, yeah.
Boney | 01:27
So movies. Yeah. So, just to imagine the time in Australia...
So, Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:36
Understood. Alright, very good. Yeah, but I have been spending, I think a lot more time than I thought I would going through and listening to your calls. Listening to. Talking to the team members. Talking to Sandy and everyone.
And I'm kind of. I think I've formed a very good picture from what everyone else has said, but I have some key questions and things I would like to, you know, ask you. Ask you, obviously. I but so far, I think the three demos or the sorry, the three the two pilots, the trials are the ones that I want to like. I'm itching to talk to you about.
But I there's. But I leave that to the very end. So what I'd like to do is to extract from your head. Right, the strategy, the vision, the product roadmap, and ask a few more questions in more detail, just looking at the product. There are a lot of different things, right? There are the time sheets, the budgets, the QR check-ins, the Gantt chart vs.
All of that: how did... There's a lot there, and it's very broad. How have you decided on putting that product roadmap together? Or how have those features been built incrementally? How are you managing that product roadmap?
Who's involved in making those decisions? How do you know what to build? Or what goes into the product roadmap right now? MY.
Boney | 03:35
So the whole product roadmap is done by myself. So I tell the team, so we have a lot of roadmaps here. I tell the team, "Okay, this is what we want to tell." So I try. Then I'll tell them that.
Okay, this is why I got the information from the customer. For example, let's take an example from ANT. He told us that. "Can we...?" The biggest challenge is that they have applied the time sheet to be implemented before, but the biggest challenge is that their site workers are not depending on the complexity of the product. The site workers are not using it.
So, is it possible that we can have that other thing in place so that they finish the work at eight hours, alert them, and then move on to the overtime kind of thing? So, that information, I take it and put it in the product road fort.
Sachee Perera | 04:45
Cool. So there's a lot of... Has everything been built like that from different customers from different customer requests? Or have you gone and looked at a problem and tried to solve it yourself and then created it and then presented it to the customer?
Boney | 05:08
So will't they tell me about the problem? I usually visualize it myself. Okay, what's the best way to solve it or what's the easiest way to solve it so that there won't be any problem for them to adopt that technology at all?
And then that's how I put it into the system, correct?
Sachee Perera | 05:31
So everything is like from demos and meetings with customers. From the... Yeah.
Boney | 05:37
Yeah. So I did the only thing that I did out of these customer demos is I go and find out in my friends circle or friends who were working in the construction industry and tapped into all those friends.
I put together 20 eight questions. I can share those questions with you. Call the customer interviews. Then I sat with them and then asked all these questions and found out how they're answering this and then built those things up.
Sachee Perera | 06:15
Four?
Boney | 06:16
So that's all when looking back, the only thing that I can see is I have spoken to two different groups. I have spoken to builders and I've spoken to subcontractors as well.
Sachee Perera | 06:36
Yeah.
Boney | 06:37
And small to all the way up to thirty-five, forty million kind of businesses.
I will talk to a project manager who is running a two billion dollar project.
Sachee Perera | 06:49
Sure.
Boney | 06:50
So that's a wide range. And so that's something that, if I look back, I should have avoided like going into that vast area of people. I'm not telling...
I have put everything into the product from all the information I have received from this last group of people. But obviously that that's the other way that I found out all these s.
Sachee Perera | 07:18
Cool. All right, so I'm hearing you reached out to the network, you did some customer discovery interviews and you visualized the problems and then customer requests. You mentioned builders, right?
So when you say builders, are you talking about the primary or principal contractor?
Boney | 07:38
Not the general contractor. The general contractors are the bigger ones, like the big massive ones. The builders that I have spoken to are much more small builders.
Sachee Perera | 07:49
Yeah.
Boney | 07:52
They're builders. building small homes. Probably custom. More like a custom build.
I got some Excel sheets from so every group I could get some Excel sheet. The GAN chat that we have built is.
Sachee Perera | 08:08
No.
Boney | 08:09
That's is... an Excel sheet I got from this home builder A and home builder B.
Sachee Perera | 08:16
Okay.
Boney | 08:17
So B. that's what I'm using.
But again, when I went back to them, okay, I sat with them and when I went back to them to ask them to use the product, then they said that there are a lot of... There are like a one-man show. They don't think that it's going to complicate their process much more because there are a lot of different things that are happening in between.
So if there's a use of direct, the payment has to be within our invoice numbers. Some day pay by cash, some day they pay. So a lot of things are happening in those small builders. That's the response I got back when I started asking them to use the product. product.
Sachee Perera | 09:14
Understood. So I was gonna talk about this later, but... So when you say builders, you're talking about small businesses. So builders is separate to your specialty contractors, like the electrical contractors, the plumbing contractors, the fitting, the fit-out contractors, right? Is that okay? Cool.
And then the general contractor is the larger one that general contractors will not engage a builder, right? They will never... A builder will never work with a general contractor or a specialty contractor.
Boney | 09:49
Okay, contractor. so for home builders, this is how it works. They pick up the subcontractors. They don't have any. They only have the site supervisors, site managers, or project managers, depending on the size of the company.
These project managers and site supervisors manage all their subcontractors. They don't have a direct worker under them. There's only a difference in the case of an interior fit-out company. They call themselves sometimes specialty contractors for builders because their work is similar to a builder. They have their own employees.
If it's a big company, they have their own employees, but they are more like shop features, kind of category lights.
Sachee Perera | 10:47
Yeah, Lesligo right, because they are a sharp fit.
Boney | 10:58
Trivision that I put it in the it's one of our Castles demos that we have provided.
Sachee Perera | 11:05
Yeah. So what is the product vision here?
Boney | 11:07
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 11:11
Because we started off with Staf. Then we pivoted to construction. We've gone and, in your head, three years from now. What is the big picture?
What is Swift Check in three to five years from now?
Boney | 11:30
For me, Swift Check should be a construction ecosystem that they can run a single process within a single platform. They will be able to do the majority of their construction operations from start to end.
Sachee Perera | 11:49
Yeah.
Boney | 11:51
That's what my vision is. And so does that answer your question? After looking at that, that's where I believe we need to find it out. That's where I believe we need to find it out from my head, I think.
Sachee Perera | 12:03
For whom?
Boney | 12:22
Look, we have two things. One is how many. We should have a sizable market within the construction industry so that we can go and tap into that market.
So, when I look from the product side, everything that we have built so far aligns to the maximum.
Sachee Perera | 12:42
Its within the.
Boney | 12:43
To a subcontractor within the construction industry. So the subcontractors need the timesheets, they need the scheduling, they need more scheduling, they need catch-at scheduling, and they need the employee scheduling as well. On a day-to-day basis, they need the employee scheduling for seeing the bigger picture.
Sachee Perera | 13:02
Sustaining. scheduling, seeing the bigger pic.
Boney | 13:06
They need to have the catch-at us.
Well, compliance with all the compliance documents, they have to store within the platform so that they can make sure that if the general contractor requests them, they can provide those documents. Budgeting is something that they need to understand how each milestone is going, whether it's according to what they have quoted or whether they have quoted.
And the missing parties. The progress claimed that I said before, from Sandy from the current group. What we understood is if you have progress clear budget, time sheet and there's a pre-construction part as well, which is actually the estimation and takeoff of those things.
But putting that aside, this itself is going to cover their two or three products that they are booking using on.
Sachee Perera | 14:15
Okay, and while you're thinking about that, right, like what do you think is the most important problem? Looking three years? Well, maybe not three years, actually. You can determine the time frame. What do you consider the most important problem that Swift solves or will solve better than everyone else?
Boney | 14:41
At the moment.
From all the discussions that we have, both the time sheet and scheduling.
Sachee Perera | 14:44
Even.
Boney | 14:53
And scheduling you ask me why that's different from the other competitor or other competitors as we use it, I think we have to sit and come up with a value proposition that we did. We differentiate ourselves with those competitors that we hear from the market because the commentator that we thought should be okay, we thought okay, I'll pass, we'll come.
But what we are hearing from the market is, for example, if you go to the subcontractors.
Sachee Perera | 15:27
For example, if you want to lis.
Boney | 15:30
But Simple, I got a tile license with me. Simplo file license, I'm just going... I got that recently. I'm just going through Simplo, but my understanding is that Simplo is for short-living jobs, like if the job is going to finish in half a day or one day time and they have to send the invoice across to their clients.
That's where the Simpler has got the power, but until date, I haven't heard from anyone who is specifically solving the problem. Ofion specific support writers.
Sachee Perera | 16:09
Yeah. And what about, Fergus?
Boney | 16:19
For Fergus, this is a good example. Gina is using Fergus for their internal employees, but they still came to us to manage the subcontractors.
Sachee Perera | 16:25
Yeah. Y.
Boney | 16:31
So what we are trying to achieve is to manage the employees that contractors in a single platform.
That's where our pricing model comes in. Then I asked this question specifically to you. I noticed that in my... Why can't you use Fergus for the purpose that they are after us? Then she told me that it's going to be a better user model.
Sachee Perera | 16:58
Yes.
Boney | 16:59
That's one problem. She said the other one is, there have to be some restrictions that need to be in place for the subcontractors to get to gather the information within the platform.
Sachee Perera | 17:11
Y so just hypothetically, enough of the customers say, "We want to manage our subcontractors too." And they deploy Fergus for subcontractors so that Gina can go in and invite all of her subcontractors with the permissions and all of that.
Now it's overlaid onto the current workflow. What separates Swift from Fergus in that instance.
Boney | 17:44
Alright, first thing is the pricing model. That's what I would say. The first thing is not the cheaper they have a user model. Which means that Gina has got no control over the employees of their subcontractors.
Sachee Perera | 17:57
To all. Okay.
Boney | 18:03
That makes sense.
Sachee Perera | 18:04
Yeah.
Boney | 18:05
So Gina is giving the subcontracting to this plaster company, ABC Plaster. And ABC Plaster might have three employees or might have ten employees, which it has got no control over, according to the schedule of the work that's provided to them. They have to have.
Sachee Perera | 18:19
Yeah. Yeah.
Boney | 18:35
Okay, I'll put it in this way. So if there are four employees of that ABC Plaster, then they have to pay file licenses from workers.
Sachee Perera | 18:43
Yeah.
Boney | 18:48
Every time they are subcontracted, they have to take another license and they have no control because tomorrow it's safe.
Plus union fees for the general contractor. So union fees. Sometimes they will take this union fees somewhere around 400 dollars, and then the subcontractor employee leaves the subcontractor, and they are still paying the union fees.
Do you know what I mean? Say similar to that, this focus, they have to keep adding that license, and there is no obligation from this ABC Plaster to tell back to Gina that my John Doe from this ABC company has left our company so we don't want to use that license anymore.
That makes sense.
Sachee Perera | 19:38
Yeah, okay, that yeah, it's an all-in rate.
Boney | 19:39
They still paying.
Sachee Perera | 19:42
Yeah. Okay, so I'm just gonna fast forward to the next question in my head right now. How can you describe the overall strategy for the business at this stage.
Boney | 20:05
Look I am really looking forward to the next two to three weeks of your report. Of all the candidates that we are running right now because even though we started actively running the campaigns from last month onwards,
that's going to give us a lot of data in terms of the business strategy, something that I know these days. Okay. We got this product, we got this vision of bringing multiple departments into a single platform of subcontracting. How many or a builderities but adoption of that technology within the business?
If you're telling these multiple stories, it's going to take some time. That's what my understanding is. If you look at our software, if whenever we get a demo, they are requesting a trial from us. So the trial is not a problem for us. Getting into the demo stage is where the problem is.
But unless we get more and more demos and talk to more and more customers and feel that, "Okay, the theory that we are putting in to take the full software as such is going to work or not." That's the question that I'm trying to answer myself.
Sachee Perera | 21:47
Yeah. Look, I don't want to say I need to. Still, I usually like to sit on and absorb as much information as possible and just sit on it and then progressively answer the question. Eddy, I think a lot of people work like that.
But I see some very simple things that we can just do to increase the demos. Very simple stuff. Which takes me to my next question.
Boney | 22:12
No.
Sachee Perera | 22:13
Like what? What made you. You know what made you go and get two sales hires?
Like the s str and. And Sandy.
Boney | 22:26
All right. Throughout this journey, one thing is very clear for you. Such as my lack of experience in sales and marketing or the lack of knowledge of sales and marketing. It is very clear here.
So all I can depend on is I can talk to my sales friends or I can talk to my sales friends. I can talk to my... Get into my network and find out whether I can get someone in sales and marketing and see what's the best way we can do it.
So coming when I took KBITA, all I was thinking is I tried to make the calls myself, but it's not consistent because I will be tracked into this technical meeting. I'll be tracked on this engineering side.
Then I realized after two or three months that that's not going to work. The next thing that I can do is find a co-founder. That's what I tried.
Sachee Perera | 23:47
Yeah.
Boney | 23:47
Advertising for you. I talked to some couple of other people as well, but that didn't go in the way that I was expecting. Then, meanwhile, all these things are happening. I need to have at least this core to be running even if I don't have that.
Sachee Perera | 24:08
Yeah.
Boney | 24:10
So once I took Kavita, then I realized again that I ought to spend quite a significant amount of time on her trying to do those things. So what of that? I have my hypothesis of getting this person in. Giving some collateral. Giving some very specific information and asking them to continuously give the calls. That's not working somehow.
Sachee Perera | 24:46
Yeah, okay, understood. I can see what's... Yeah, how.
Boney | 24:47
Then that's when I have to bring Sandy in as well.
So yeah, I'll always still the... I'll always with the hosts we play on day so that we can leave from it and understand what actually happen.
Sachee Perera | 25:09
But Sandy didn't come first, Kavita came first.
Boney | 25:13
Cover that gate first.
Sachee Perera | 25:13
Yeah, understood. Okay, that makes more sense.
Boney | 25:17
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 25:18
And one thing that's really clear is you guys are very efficient and fast at deploying on the product, like building, which is crazy, which is really good.
Boney | 25:18
So probably two or three weeks after coming up. I think Sandy gave... If I'm.
Sachee Perera | 25:37
I think that's... I remember you saying in our first meeting you were doing a reskin or a new UI and then just from my memory of how the product was and what it is right now from the Slico and the current group demos, it looks very different.
Then I saw you didn't have a mobile app and now you have a mobile app already, right? Which is, do you have a mobile app now, Right?
Boney | 26:05
Now we still don't have a mobile app, but we found out a way to tweak into the actual product to install it as a mobile app so that customers feed does a mobile app.
Sachee Perera | 26:09
Okay, yeah, cool.
Boney | 26:19
But actually, it's not a mobile app.
Sachee Perera | 26:23
And you can still get the notifications and the GPS and everything through that, right?
Okay. Cool. YH.
Boney | 26:32
Correct? Yeah, but... That's going to work. But we are facing an enormous technical challenge of not having a proper mobile app, which is the reason why I am here to hire a person to panelly develop the mobile app while we are doing all those things because we've got everything in place right now, so this person has to do only one thing, concentrate on doing that.
Sachee Perera | 26:47
Yeah.
Boney | 26:58
Mobilela app, but as coming back to your question, the GPS should work, the notification should work.
Sachee Perera | 26:58
One.
Boney | 27:09
But it was very tricky to make it work, and some years we didn't find any problems so far with the way that we have done, but it's a bit crazy way of doing it.
Sachee Perera | 27:22
That think that will work for now until we get there.
Boney | 27:23
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. That's what I'm reading.
Sachee Perera | 27:31
I mean, it's fine. Well, what I was going to go, okay, cool. I think I've got a better understanding of what's in yourad right now. I'm really itching to know about... SL Andrew. Did you call? Get a TI.
Boney | 27:52
Yeah. Not since my last meeting. Since my last call, I need to give him a call today and go through him and tell him to book a meeting for next week. The reason things are getting pretty late is I need to pay for what's called hunting.
Yeah, so I just want to be open with you right now.
Sachee Perera | 28:13
Yes.
Boney | 28:15
I just borrowed some more money from one of my friends and put that into the company to run for the next 3-4 months.
Sachee Perera | 28:24
Okay.
Boney | 28:26
That's how it's working. Don't worry, what your pavement does will be sorted out. [Laughter] I just want to be very open, so you should never think that I'm just delaying this call because I'm concentrating more.
So I had a meeting with JSON yesterday. I had a meeting with Prager, and he's in the construction technology space. So both of those days are related to the funding plus Mongase funding plus the construction technology space. The other Jason, you probably already know. I'm not sure whether you know Jason Atkins. He's more into the table
funding those kinds of areas. So Jason Atkins, yeah, I think he's a founder of Fakey Quick good, yeah.
Sachee Perera | 29:24
So. yeah, okay, cool. Yeah, I've heard of him. I don't know him, but I've heard of him. Yeah, look, I'm just going to say my payments and stuff.
Boney | 29:34
So I'm collecting all these things and putting... We never had an ESAU until now, so I'm putting together that EESOP. There are a lot of things that are happening finally.
That's the reason why these other things are getting delayed. Yet.
Sachee Perera | 29:59
If we need to defer that to the next fund, like next year, that's fine. We need to get the business up and running and revenue coming. I'd like it if we do that, and we will not be too concerned about it right now, excluding you, right? What is the runway that you have for four months, and what's your cost?
Boney | 30:18
The runway is for four months. Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 30:24
What's your operating costs.
Boney | 30:27
Operating costs currently are sitting somewhere between $20,000 to $25,000 per month, tosi.
Sachee Perera | 30:33
Ozzie? Okay, cool, okay, so we need to okay, so 25, we need 25K to breakeven.
Boney | 30:44
8 public sales.
Sachee Perera | 30:45
Yeah, right. What is the biggest cost?
Boney | 30:56
I believe the product engineering team is the largest team that we have.
Sachee Perera | 31:00
Three.
Boney | 31:00
I'm not taking any salary. Lisa is not taking any salary. We. Yes, since the start of the business, we both didn't take a salary without both of our salary. This is what the expenses.
But it's more I think three grand, two and a half grand. We are spending on marketing on the per month start time.
Sachee Perera | 31:29
Sorry, my phone's... per month. Okay, cool. So you're paying $2,500 just on marketing ads and stuff.
Boney | 31:41
I thought of ads, tools, and everything. I believe for the product engineering team, we might be spending around $7,000 to $8,000 per mark.
Sachee Perera | 31:57
Okay, I know, yeah, because I when I.
Boney | 32:01
Then marketing salary the two people in marketing Sandy plus kvia sales salary then a sales we areending five six grand as for as sales.
Sachee Perera | 32:19
What do you mean, $5,000 to $6,000 for sales, on top of the salary?
Boney | 32:24
No, not just for the s.
Sachee Perera | 32:27
Okay YP. Okay, cool.
Alright, so. So twenty five k you have four month run runway. Okay, cool. So let's convert these two deals. I think that's critical for us. So, Andrew, we had for next week. And you're going to call and
set up a meeting. And then Gina.
Boney | 33:02
Ginna. Sandy is talking with Gina, and she last time we spoke she pushed it for just to leave here for this month. But this is really probably... It might be too early. It might be too early for asking this question to you. This is where I feel that somewhere in the discovery call or during the demo, we need to have something like, "Okay, if we don't implement this product, this is the kind of money that you are losing from the information that they are providing." I believe if we can provide that kind of information rather than be pushing them to implement this solution, they will take much more initiative.
That's what my understanding is. Yeah, that's just a football thought that came to my mind.
Sachee Perera | 34:17
Okay, yeah, and Gina, in Melbourne, right?
Boney | 34:21
Now. She's in Kinsland.
Sachee Perera | 34:23
She's in Queensland. Okay, sorry, I'm mixing it up. Okay, cool. Yeah, I was just listening to some sales calls and looking at the emails and stuff.
I think there's some very easy stuff we can do straight away. I would like to reduce the cost of your marketing tools and stuff. The two and a half... I think that's... I'd like to understand how you're spending that currently.
Boney | 34:55
2.
Sachee Perera | 34:56
And looked at the marketing side as well, but I think Nisha shared some more information for me earlier today. I'd like to understand the ROI of that to start off with.
Boney | 35:08
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 35:08
And it actually working?
Because from what I'm seeing, it's not. We're doing a lot of stuff at the moment, and we need to experiment. We're experimenting and doing a lot of things to try and find out what works. One doesn't...
But I think I'm not sure 100% yet, but I think there is a way to focus on one or two areas and just do that as a sprint for the three months, right? But we try and get that and get the business focused on just that.
Right? I don't know, and I think I know where it is. It's identifying your actual one segment. Is it the specialty trade contractors, and then is the electrical? Do we go all the way down to electrical versus homebuilders versus fit-out versus this or what? What do we just... It's for the full... It's general for all of them.
But structure the messaging, structure the positioning, structure the product, but what are the key... Maybe without telling you this, from Swift check in from the core plant side, what really worked was we were doing everything.
Then when I looked at it, there were only the contractors, and they were in Karguli.
Boney | 36:39
He.
Sachee Perera | 36:44
So I focused on just Karguel, this is a town, right? Just one or two types of contractors, and I just did the sales myself, did the work, went to events, did all of that.
Boney | 36:50
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 37:00
So it's identifying what's your... It's like a door, right? To open a door. If it's a heavy door, you can't open it with one hand. You need to push and then get some sort of a crowbar and wedge it into the door.
So now you have the door open, and then you can keep adding more and more. So what's that little wedge that we can use to get into the market and then grow it? So, is it Sico, is it the current group, or is it the other businesses? We just need to close one or two of those.
So, we know exactly... Who do we focus on? So then we can go and say, "Hey, we know you're an electrical contractor and subcontractor, and these are your pains." Here is... We know that you're paying for ghost employees and you're losing revenue or you're losing profit. Here's how we can help you do this. Here's a second infusion or Gina' or another company like Gina'. Hey, we know you're managing your contractors and your employees' co-plan.
Sorry, not Cora Swift check-in will help you manage your subcontractors, okay? Just don't worry about the employees, just the subcontractors. Then that's the land, and then we can expand.
It's like, what are the little stepping stones? We need to go from here to the next step? Yeah, so I'm trying to understand the landscape a little bit more, which is why I was asking you when you said builders, what do you mean by builders? Is it homebuilders?
Boney | 39:00
He absolutely.
Sachee Perera | 39:00
Yeah, it is homebuilders. Yeah, I'm trying to understand who we can focus on. When we pick up the phone and we talk to them, it is very specific. It's almost like they know that we know how they run their business.
Boney | 39:18
I see.
Sachee Perera | 39:19
Yeah, so I think that's the finding, or those are the learnings from previous.
Boney | 39:21
Just.
Sachee Perera | 39:28
And then I'm seeing is we're trying to do a lot. We just need to focus on one and it's not like forever, it's for the next, you know, till we had a revenue.
Boney | 39:41
Next year.
Sachee Perera | 39:41
Yeah. Till the next. And the next. Yeah, look, the website is right?
Boney | 39:46
Yeah. I do have this feeling of just going with only one or two things and having all our website messaging matched to those two messages because somewhere I feel such that even though people are coming to blank pages so they're not going further down, taking that action.
So that's when I feel that either our messaging is not right or we are telling too many things so that they don't understand clearly what they're trying to solve by using a ro.
Sachee Perera | 40:44
And really important to have a very good-looking website that's clear and people can understand.
But it's almost like, just like how you have concept cars. People have cars like what to have a concept car. Honda may have a concept car, but it doesn't come to life.
It's there for show that this brand is doing some cool stuff. I think for where we are right now.
Boney | 41:15
He.
Sachee Perera | 41:18
The website is important, the messaging generally is important, but I would focus on the sales. We need to get the sales guys up and running.
And the what they would do. Sorry. What I'm saying is if we were more marketing-led, if it was all ads and all like that, then investing in the marketing website is going to be important. But we need to do the sales part first to go what works one-on-one, one customer to another customer.
So marketing becomes important after we have solved that because sales is one-on-one, marketing is one-many. So until we have solved the sales problem, it's almost not well, my personal way for me personally, what's worked is investing in marketing into this kind of stuff after the sales aspect because then you know what to talk about.
Boney | 42:11
Heym okay.
Sachee Perera | 42:29
So, what but that doesn't mean we shouldn't do anything. What what's there right now is great. It creates almost enough mystery for. So if someone does come in, it creates almost enough mystery for someone to go and click the demo button.
But I think we're a little we are not there yet to go marketing led we need to. So to understand the customer pain points and everything from sales and the core focus of sales should be to get the demos do discovery like very discovery questions to understand their problems.
So when we present the product, we are presenting a solution. We are sorry. When we are presenting the product, we understand their problems first, then we present relevant to them. Otherwise it's not going to be that.
Well, otherwise, yeah, it won't. Marketing is not going to be an efficient use of your time or resources to invest.
Boney | 43:51
Quit you.
Sachee Perera | 43:52
YP because the Australian market is very small and it is very digitized. Going sales-led is important. That's
why I wanted to... I think over the weekend, I'll spend some more time looking at the marketing side. I was listening to all the calls and things over the last couple of days. I want to understand what the current ROI is or how marketing is working and what the actual.
Boney | 44:24
I day.
Sachee Perera | 44:25
Yeah.
Boney | 44:27
But I want to tell you before. I think last month the marketing spend was very little, like five hundred to less than a thousand dollars a month.
Sachee Perera | 44:36
Okay.

Then this one we increased the budget. When I got this extra money in from which I borrowed, that's when we spent that.
That's when we put up the marketing spend to, I think, it's two grand or two and a half grand. I believe. Just to try the different landing pages we are putting in.
Sachee Perera | 45:04
And a good investment because you're experimenting, right? That's fine. Yeah, it'll be good to put together a budget over the next couple of months, but I think I have enough. I just need to go away and
make my notes and listen to more calls. So, I'm going to talk to a couple of my network as well to understand a little bit more. One of my close friends is actually a project manager from the client side.
So, I'm going to try and talk to them as well.
Boney | 45:46
No.
Sachee Perera | 45:49
But think all in all, it's a good time for the business because you've established an operating model that works to ship products super fast, right?
You have some good people in the business as well. Everyone is very excited and very involved. Sandy is exceptional, as is Jadev. I think the findings of listening to the calls from Slico and the current group give me strong confidence on how to get to your three to five-year plan.
Where do we like the path to get there? Five four.
Boney | 46:36
Great to hear that. What are your thoughts after one week of spending with us, apart from what I said right now, do you wait for your final report? From what you thought one week ago and one week after with us. What do you think.
Sachee Perera | 47:03
I thought you may have had a lot more demos. You had spoken to more of the same customers, and you'd have a lot more of those recordings. It was a matter of product placement, pricing, or maybe one of those, so that was a little bit under the five-K burn, not concerning. I want to get my head around that.
I think we can reduce that as well. But my assumptions were you are spending less than what you're spending right now. And you had more demos, but that was my assumption. Yeah.
Boney | 47:58
So the idea in your mind if I could ask you to put the number out there. What's your expectation on our spending?
Sachee Perera | 48:10
Sorry, what's my expectation on.
Boney | 48:12
What on our spending?
Like you are expecting 15. Spending at 15 grand. Or with a t.
Sachee Perera | 48:23
So maybe I'm just trying to remember what we were spending and the early days. I can't remember, but I can't actually remember. I think maybe 15K would have been it because you have your team in India, ten to 15K maybe is what I want, but maybe that's just it doesn't have any science or data behind it. It was just in my head where I had.
Boney | 49:00
Just final. Came that way out of your head? Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 49:04
Yeah, that was it.
Boney | 49:05
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 49:05
And if Sandy and Kavi are commission-based, then you know that. You know, that's what I was expecting. But I think I'm very... I'm bullish. I'm hopeful. I think we can get there. We just need to hyper-focus on a couple of key areas.
What do we start doing? What do we stop doing and what do we continue doing is what I want to get to. Yeah, cool, awesome, right?
Boney | 49:35
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 49:38
Bonnie, I'm going to let you go. I'm probably not going to join the leadership meetings every day.
I'll join in if I can, but I will. I'm going to spend the next couple of days just going through. I might shoot some messages over to you, and I'll still talk to the team and stuff.
Boney | 49:57
No.
Sachee Perera | 49:58
The report I'll be giving to you is not going to be...
It's going to be a report, but we'll go through everything one-on-one, right? I'll talk you through the different parts, but I want to keep it simple and just focused on what we do in the next ninety days that can try us to near breakeven.
Boney | 50:15
Two.
Sachee Perera | 50:20
Because that's going to be important.
Boney | 50:21
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 50:23
Well, yeah, to get generate revenue, but then breakeven. Sorry, I have one question I forgot to ask. Your pricing model. I notice you didn't give any pricing to Gina' or Andrew. Were you working on a new pricing model? Or do you have anything Or.
Boney | 50:46
I think the pricing we put in just 23 days before you started. Probably that pricing was put there two weeks, two or three weeks ago after the demo that we were done with Andrew and Ginna.
Sachee Perera | 51:03
Yes.
Boney | 51:03
So yeah. And that pricing is Santi and Jay, okay? Regarding the pricing, I will tell you the background. So no one in the construction industry has put the pricing on their website. Okay. So I was a bit hesitant to put the pricing on our website because I was still not clear whether we were not going to give the full product or just module-wise.
But Santi and Jay were pushing me to come up with a pricing. So I put forward some pricing that's going to be fairly similar with everyone that we are targeting. That's how I put the price in. It has called nothing to pay up or anything like that. We are still experimenting with the pricing, to be honest with you.
So I put some amount out there. When I put it there, I told the team, "Okay, this is what I want to mandate. If we put the pricing in fiction, then we put the pricing, and I want to see people going and clicking into the free plan, going into the demo.
Sachee Perera | 52:19
No.
Boney | 52:19
But since we put the pricing, I believe it's probably three weeks ago, four weeks ago, even though the people who came to the website have gone up. I didn't see people going into the free plan, but they haven't filled out the form.
Going forward.
Sachee Perera | 52:39
Yeah, okay, so if we talk about just Slico, is it Slico or Silo? It's Slico, right? Yeah, I think she said she was paying for Fergus. $300 per month for 20 staff, and they are at a discount.
Boney | 52:58
No.
Sachee Perera | 53:00
What do you think is the pricing that we should provide to Slico?
Boney | 53:08
It's like it's... So ideally, we should start with that for our basic plan, just with the check-in and check-out for the subcontractors. That's it. Then probably we can expand later saying that. Okay, this is what it's going to be.
From there, from the data that they have provided, that they got almost ten to fifty subcontractors, ten subcontractors, and they have no idea how many of those contractors have five employees, two employees.
We have no idea.
So that's something. So we're talking about, say, five employees. Then it's 50-50 users that are going to come into our system, plus three or four apps. So five.
Sachee Perera | 54:08
Yeah, okay, cool. Alright, let's talk a little bit more about the pricing stuff after I've done a little bit more work.
Maybe for the current group and Slico, maybe we say, "Here's our normal pricing, but we'll do something special for you.
Boney | 54:17
Two.
Sachee Perera | 54:24
Here's our pricing for them just to convert them. Yup, yes, cool.
Boney | 54:39
Five.
Sachee Perera | 54:39
Alright, Bonnie, thank you so much for the chat. Enjoy your weekend, and you have much planned or?
Boney | 54:46
Look, I just want to spend some time with the kids. I've been away for the last three or four months, and they started complaining of not getting the data. So that's when I flew down here and I just spent some good time with my kids because usually when I come to the office in the morning, they won't wake up.
Sachee Perera | 55:06
I come to the office in the morning the week.
Boney | 55:10
So I had to start early. And by the time yester. Still I finish of. Even though I started at 06:30 in the morning, I finish at six 30 in the night.
Sachee Perera | 55:19
No.
Boney | 55:19
And then, yeah, then they were like, "But eventually." I took them out to dinner, and then we had some late-night time.
Yeah, two in year five and year one.
Sachee Perera | 55:33
Okay, cool. Wow, very nice. I Bonnie, I enjoy your weekend. Spend time with the family and I will see I'll speak, I'll click you and over the weekend, sorry, on Monday if I have any questions y cool, sure, thank you.
Boney | 55:45
Yeah.
So, one more thing before I forget. I think you asked some documents from Lisa. She told me that she shared the full marketing for you. But sometimes she's going to send you a message or catch up with you for 5:10 minutes to go through those folders.
And what is what? She's going to explain those things. So she told me to pass this message. And That.
Sachee Perera | 56:25
All right, have a good day, see you later.
