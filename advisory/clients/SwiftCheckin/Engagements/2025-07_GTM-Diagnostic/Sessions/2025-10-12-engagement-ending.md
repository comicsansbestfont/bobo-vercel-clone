# Session Notes: October 12, 2025

**Session Type:** Engagement Conclusion Discussion
**Duration:** ~60 minutes
**Attendees:** Sachee Perera, Boney Mylady

---

## Focus
Sachee's decision to end engagement at 3-month term completion (October 14, 2025)

## Key Discussion Points

1. **Pre-meeting Demos Success** - Two strong meetings that day:
   - Aegis (property developer, 15-20 contractors, easy yes on pricing)
   - WA Electrical (Ariel impressed by "workplace overtime" marketing positioning)

2. **Training Completion** - Sachee completed training session with Kavita and Nisha; they can make calls but still need experienced full-time management

3. **Core Issue: Execution vs Strategy Mismatch** - SwiftCheckin needs full-time, hands-on sales execution with AU-based experienced team; Sachee can't provide that realistically until Jan at earliest, and even then only 1-2 days/week isn't sufficient

4. **Commercial Reality** - Sachee spending 20+ hours/week on execution work (training, materials) that wasn't in original scope; can't continue deferring payments indefinitely

5. **Board Accountability Concern** - Option 2 won't give board confidence; Option 3 requires experienced team first

## Decisions Made

- **Engagement to end October 14, 2025** (end of 3-month term)
- Sachee will defer original 12.5K payment to July 1, 2026 without additional fees
- Sachee will NOT complete HubSpot sales stage mapping
- Sachee WILL complete: Demo training, Job description, Candidate introductions, Next steps plan

## Action Items

| Owner | Action | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Sachee | Draft follow-up emails for Aegis and Ariel deals | Pending |
| Sachee | Complete Nisha/Kavita training to get them demo-ready | Pending |
| Sachee | Write job description for experienced AU-based salesperson | Pending |
| Sachee | Create "now, next, later" wireframe/plan | Pending |
| Boney | Reflect on alternatives before follow-up call | Pending |
| Both | Schedule wrap-up call during Boney's US trip (Oct 14-21) | Pending |

## Valuation-Relevant Data

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| New Pipeline | Aegis (property developer, 15-20 contractors), WA Electrical (Ariel) |
| Sales Capability | Kavita and Nisha trained, can execute calls, but inexperienced |
| Funding Trip | Boney traveling to Silicon Valley Oct 14-21 |
| Engagement Financials | Original 12.5K deferred to July 1, 2026 |
| Strategic Foundation | Positioning, ICP, messaging, playbooks, first customer all delivered |

## Path Forward Options

1. **Founder-led selling** - Use delivered playbooks, keep Kavita/Nisha, do more lead gen, Boney runs sales calls
2. **Re-engage Harry Constant** - Agency cold caller to do demos, Boney does closing, using new playbooks
3. **Hire experienced salesperson** - 3-5 years AU experience, then re-engage fractional CRO

## Notable Quotes

> "What you need right now is someone who can be in the business full time running sales themselves until you can afford to build a proper team... I can't provide the time that is required." — Sachee

> "Now it's getting clear... if Kavita and Nisha was not there and an experienced 3-5 years salesperson was there, that will work with option three..." — Boney
