# Session Notes: September 17, 2025

**Session Type:** Strategy Decision Session
**Duration:** ~48 minutes
**Attendees:** Sachee Perera, Boney Mylady

---

## Focus
Decision to exit Sandy and finalize go-forward plan

## Key Discussion Points

1. **Sandy Exit Decision** - Boney decided Sandy and Sachee's sales philosophies don't align. Sandy expects inbound leads with intent; reluctant to make cold calls. After 5 months, insufficient results (8 calls made on Sept 16, multiple overdue follow-ups).

2. **Mindset vs Skill Issue** - Sandy's problem is mindset, not skill. He doesn't believe product is worth $229 price point, which undermines sales effectiveness. Contrast with Kavita's pure hustle mentality.

3. **Training Structure** - Sachee to create training slides from scratch. Will deliver 1-hour sessions over 2 weeks for Kavita & Nisha. Focus: psychology + practical application.

4. **3-Phase Strategy**:
   - Phase 1: Train Kavita/Nisha to generate demo burst
   - Phase 2: Use traction to secure funding by Dec
   - Phase 3: Hire full-time onshore SDR/AE with funding

5. **Marketing Experiments** - JayDev to run hyper-local Facebook ads targeting MJJ Constructions' postcode with $50/month budget.

## Decisions Made

- **Exit Sandy immediately** - ABN contract, 1-week notice period
- **Kavita + Nisha + Sachee training** - 2-3 week intensive sprint starting next week
- **Boney runs all demos and sales** - From demo onwards through close
- **JayDev owns event strategy** - Research expos, sundowners, networking events
- **ESIC qualification** - Engage Mark (accountant) to advise on timing

## Notable Quotes

> "If the salesman don't trust in the product or don't think that the software is valuable for the amount that he is trying to sell, then how can he make a sale?" — Boney

> "The people that you're trying to get in touch with, they're actually not online. They don't even know the product exists... mostly offline and the only way is picking up the phone and calling them." — Sachee
