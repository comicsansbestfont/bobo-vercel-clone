# Session Notes: September 16, 2025

**Session Type:** Critical Decision Discussion
**Duration:** ~26 minutes
**Attendees:** Sachee Perera, Boney Mylady

---

## Focus
Critical decision point on team structure and path forward

## Key Discussion Points

1. **Burn Rate and Hiring Constraints** - Decent SDR costs $80-120K AUD total comp. Two options: cut team and reduce runway, or continue with current team and train intensively.

2. **Kavita vs Sandy Training Assessment** - Sachee questions whether 6 months of Sandy's training has been effective given Kavita's current skill gaps. Points to training issue, not capability issue.

3. **Short-term Sprint Proposal** - Sachee proposes 2-3 week intensive training sprint for Kavita and Nisha (cannot commit long-term). Focus: bring demos to Boney, who runs sales cycle from demo to close.

4. **Funding-Dependent Hiring** - Cannot realistically hire quality Australian SDR without raising funds first. Need to prove repeatability (target: 10-20 deals) to secure funding.

5. **Execution Bottleneck** - Getting to the demo is the hard part; Boney confident he can close once prospects are in demo stage.

## Decisions Made

- **Keep Kavita** - She has the right mindset ("pure grit and hustle"), just needs training
- **Short-term band-aid solution** - Use Nisha + Kavita with intensive training to generate demo flow
- **Boney runs full sales cycle** - From demo through close (happy to do first 100 customers this way)
- **Defer long-term hiring** - Wait until after funding to bring on experienced AU SDR/AE
- **Sachee to structure remote training** - 2-3 week sprint delivered remotely

## Action Items

| Owner | Action | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Sachee | Design 2-3 week remote training sprint | Pending |

## Valuation-Relevant Data

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| SDR market rate (AU) | $80-120K base + OTE = $180-200K total |
| Team burn | 4 people too expensive for pre-revenue |
| Kavita's results (5-6 months) | 6-7 demos total (Andrew, Damien, Adam, John/PC Engineering, Stephen Edwards) |
| Expected close rate | If 10 demos, expect 5-8 closes (50-80%) |

## Notable Quotes

> "Do you know we have put an advertisement for SDR two times in Australia... everyone is looking for 80 to 90 [base]... minimum that we have got is 120 plus [base]." — Boney

> "She has got that mindset. Okay, look, this is what is. I will go and do it regardless... Just pure grit, just pure hustle." — Boney on Kavita
