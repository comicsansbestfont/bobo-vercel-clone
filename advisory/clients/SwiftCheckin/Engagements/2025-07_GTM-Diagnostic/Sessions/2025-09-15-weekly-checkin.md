**Session Type:** Weekly Check-in
**Duration:** ~88 minutes
**Attendees:** Sachee Perera, Boney Mylady

## Focus
Sales activity progress review and future engagement structure discussion

## Key Discussion Points

1. **Sales Progress Update** - PC Engineering demo (4pm that day, not confirmed). John needs manager permission, mentioned they "might go with another software."

2. **Tech-touch vs High-touch Performance**:
   - Kavita (tech-touch): 36 contacts enrolled, 27% open rate, 3.75 touch points per contact, brought in PC Engineering
   - Sandy (high-touch): 65 contacts, only 8% open rate, less persistence

3. **Call Recording Issue** - Team removed call recording feature to avoid disclosure message. Sachee advises standard practice is to disclose mid-call.

4. **Engagement Structure** - Detailed slides presented on Option 2 (Strategic Advisor: 4-8 hrs/week) vs Option 3 (Fractional Exec: 1-2 days/week).

5. **Team Capability Assessment** - Sachee expresses doubt Sandy can become account executive: "I honestly don't think... the capability is there from what I see now."

## Decisions Made

- Schedule call review session with Kavita for next week
- Nisha to begin tech-touch training (meeting Sept 16, 9am)
- Hold on Sandy evaluation - give more time with new structure
- Option 2 vs 3 decision deferred - Boney to review framework
- Marketing paused - focus on outbound execution

## Notable Quotes

> "It's not linear, right. You don't just go and make a whole bunch of phone calls and then secure get your demos. It's the full cycle..." — Sachee

> "I was expecting at least one or two demos by this time... The question that comes back of my mind is, is that working really?" — Boney
