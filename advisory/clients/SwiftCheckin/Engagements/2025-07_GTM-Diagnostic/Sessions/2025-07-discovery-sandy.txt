Sachee Perera | 00:32
Hey. Good morning.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 00:34
Hey. Morning. Mary, I'm doing very good. Just had my bri.
Sachee Perera | 00:35
How are you doing? [Laughter].
Sandy Balakrishnan | 00:42
I just matched the Australian lunchtime with the breakfast time back on 01:00 pm.
Sachee Perera | 00:47
Okay. I was actually trying to figure out how to call you on Zoom and then you called me straight away. So [Laughter] you read.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 00:59
The. was thinking, like, I know I've been in your same shoes. I heard a lot of Zoho while I'm in Australia, but I never tried it and I'm not exactly a great fan of it when it comes to the wrong thing. I like my text tack well and good and arranged to get it, but it's not bad.
I think, so normally by now you might have figured it out. Internally it is Zoho, but client-facing we have the combination of Outlook and that gives the things easy, you know, with the people too. We were really good, man, very really. I thought like, I did mention to him as well, like probably as you get a day just to figure his things out: where is what and everywhere.
Sachee Perera | 01:38
Did mention to you my so, like POs. I think it just... his yeah, where are you based right now?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:45
And he'll be picking from one side and then he can go to the other end with other people looking into the process and everything. Absolutely.
Sachee Perera | 01:56
I'm sorry. I know you're in India, but where exactly?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 02:00
So I'm in Kera same state where. Yeah, same state where, Bony is.
It's, he's like somewhere close to mid as down. So K is my state, so my hometown is. So my home country is India, and the Kella is my family, where my parents and everybody live. That's my house is everything, because I was an expert. My parents. I grew up in the Middle East, in Bahrain. I was born there.
Yeah, so I was born in Bahrain because my dad was an engineer there. He was working there, he spent his lifetime there, so I went to school there. Then when I was in sixth grade, my family just relocated here because there was nobody over here, so my dad stayed there. I came back here, did my schooling.
I did my bachelor's in engineering here, and I went to work in Southeast.
So I went back to the Middle East.
Sachee Perera | 02:59
So you to send the on the site yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 02:59
So I'm done two years into the engineering on the site. What, like I put on different hats. So I started off in the field pretty much like Ferman and just went on to being into the site management basically as a site charge running a project over there.
Sachee Perera | 03:16
Yeah because the.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 03:16
Then I got a bit of a quit with it because I wanted to explore.
For me, it was going to the Western country and getting a lot more of the processes and moving into the management consulting space at that point in time. That's why in 2015 I came to Australia.
So I was in Canberra for three years, I've done my schooling there. I went to a project at that point in time, project management was the thing in 2015. So we were the earliest badges we went into it. Bonnie is similar. He has done his project management, I guess, in the TS.
Sachee Perera | 03:47
Yeah like writing.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 03:49
Then I read the market.
So when it comes to Australia, there are things that work with its scale and with the size of the market.
Sachee Perera | 03:52
So it comes to rest, and so things getting the size of the markets you like, comments, or regional projects.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 03:58
S the figure is like digital transformation projects, which is where the market is headed, where it has a bigger market, whether it's sales, whether it's a transformation project, whether it's consulting.
Sachee Perera | 04:01
And so the market is as a big market. H yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 04:10
So in a short span of time, I moved around, interning with marketing projects a couple of them, and then I landed into sales in early 2018. So, I started off with FinTech, an accounting company, this company called Sage. Now they're like a third runner these days.
That's where I started. Then I got part of another startup. There's a US-based company. They do a lot of the sales outsourcing and run larger organizations.
Sachee Perera | 04:38
No, this was.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 04:38
So with them, I was a couple of years with Microsoft, and I had a few years with Cisco in the channel sales side, and then I wanted to check out the commercial side of energy sales because that's a huge market in Australia as well.
I did that a bit, but I didn't... My PR didn't come through in a timely manner like I thought. So, I transitioned back to India, as I said, there was a lot of trends when I was learning with the organizations I've worked with.
I have seen how the sales processes are getting moved around in the APAC region, between Australia and New Zealand, from a cost perspective, and all of those. I've been part of that as well and training up, moving around a bit of those. That's what my organization did. Eventually, they got acquired by Accenture, and pretty much our leaders had done the exit after two to three years, the mandatory thing after the acquisitions. They started leaving thing.
Sachee Perera | 05:37
And pretty much it's in yeah, thing.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 05:47
So that's the thing. I came down to India and figured out there's quite a bit of journey.
Sachee Perera | 05:49
And figured it out.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 05:54
I can see a lot of GZ CS happening here. But yeah, that's with me. But my heart is in Australia a lot because that's where I spend the best of my time. My friends, most of my networks, are pretty outdoorsy people. I'm like a beach person. I've gone to the beach two to three times. I'm on the beach, I go to the beach.
Sachee Perera | 06:16
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 06:18
Laura, a huge movie fan.
You see me once every week, probably I'll be in the theater, getting into the movies, all of those kinds of things.
Sachee Perera | 06:28
One.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 06:29
Yeah, that's a bit about me. We started, like a conversation with Bonnie through a friend of mine.
Sachee Perera | 06:31
Let's the. At the first time, he said.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 06:36
And things just organically just happened on a cube. I told them, "Okay, I'll step in and see what's going on here." We are with all of this here.
Sachee Perera | 06:44
Okay. And it's been, what, you've been with the business for two months now? Three, two.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 06:52
I will say around three because I came in mid of April. In April is full of holidays.
Sachee Perera | 06:57
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 06:58
Every single week is like three days. So we came in may, and then we I would say we got some ground started like last week of may. June was like a this month.
Sachee Perera | 07:10
Okay.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 07:11
And are coming into place. In July, there are a lot of things. The thing is that Bonnie is a first-time founder and a technical person, and I feel like, to see and to see the other side.
You will come to know, I think, shortly when you work with him. He and I think the marketing had a perception of how sales is and how the product should sell in the market to how it actually sells in the market.
So that is... That's been quite a journey. There's a lot of rewiring, remarking, expectations, and has gone through. But I would say it's around three months. I started some made of Apple. The interesting thing is, when I started, I already had the SD out there. She has been hired like three weeks back.
Yeah. So I jumped in and I got her and I got it. There was a good thing I did to bridge that gap because one, she is very young as a rope. That's another thing. She was coming from a B2B sales background and probably like teleco sales. One thing, she's based in India. Apparently, she had said she had worked with the international market.
So there's a lot of gaps in a bridging after going through with it.
Sachee Perera | 08:33
Yes, yeah, that's cool.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 08:34
But yeah, it's been close to around three months, we can say. What have you gone through? Yeah, Indian school, Bahrain, I started with the Sitra campus and then what is Sitra?
Sachee Perera | 08:41
You mentioned you were in Bahrain, which school did you go to and when was it okay?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 08:55
Yeah, Cera up to I think third grade and then I'm met to Isaton for fourth and fifth grade. That's a big... That's now the Knowledge City, right?
Sachee Perera | 09:04
I grew up in Bahrain as well, so 90-96 to 99.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 09:08
Alright, that's right. You what time like what time frames.
Sachee Perera | 09:15
Yeah, my dad was working for four years. Sorry, 95 to 2000, not 99. Yeah, 95 to 2000, which is... Yeah, but I went to second.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 09:29
A Sacred heart.
Sachee Perera | 09:30
Yeah, I crossed the road from the Indian school.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 09:31
Yeah he got more money then probably... Dad was doing better off.
Sachee Perera | 09:33
[Laughter] Well, I don't.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 09:37
[Laughter] No, n yeah, 90.
Sachee Perera | 09:40
It's the same thing. I don't know. It was a long time ago. I was very young.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 09:49
I left Bahrain in 2000. Sorry, I left Bahrain in 2000.
So yeah, technically speaking, I think you're coming off very close in age.
Sachee Perera | 10:01
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 10:01
So I was there. I'm born in 1988. So pretty much, I think, in the same school when we were in primary schools.
Sachee Perera | 10:12
Absolutely.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 10:12
I know soccer. Yeah, I know soccer. Hart cards are four to five times more expensive in tuition fees compared to mine.
Sachee Perera | 10:19
Who was it?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 10:21
Yeah, I'll tell you. It was costing around.
Sachee Perera | 10:22
I.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 10:27
It was costing around 800 to 850 Bahraini dinars at that point for a year.
Sachee Perera | 10:32
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 10:32
Indian School was 24 dinars a month.
So usually, the British expats... So you know that people who had the password from Australia, America, UK, they get treated in a different category from pay grades to everything. So those who are families who have the passwords from those kinds of countries, usually the company puts their kids into sacred hats and a couple of cool there because they carry the tuition fees.
Sachee Perera | 11:05
Okay, last.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 11:06
That's a norm. But I can be totally wrong. If you can afford it, it's a different thing. But you won't find normal much of the normal kiddos there because there is the monthly... It becomes almost equal to some people's salaries in that part in that time.
I know that I know very well, because my.
Sachee Perera | 11:24
I'm surprised.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 11:26
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 11:27
I'm surprised you remember that much. It was a... Yeah, you're almost my age. So [Laughter] it was a long time ago.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 11:35
It's a long time, and unfortunately, it didn't get much connection because those days, Facebook wasn't there?
Sachee Perera | 11:44
One.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 11:45
And was pretty much slam books and everything. But I know a few of them strayed back in Australia.
So in Bahrain, they led on their own lives there. A few came back, a few migrated like you to the US. And Australia with their parents. They made the transition. Yeah, so I had it in my back of mind, and look, my back calling was no Orientia. India is my place.
It's kind of home, but where you like to find your way back, right? So I came here, worked my way down here, which is good, which makes me multilingual. Pretty fluent in my local languages, but culturally, I got that Middle East alignment.
Then, like I said, I did my share there. Then I moved to Australia. Australia is much better in terms of a lot of things. People-wise, culture-wise, people do overlook that anywhere globally as well when I worked with most of the MNCs that I worked with, which is Disco, Microsoft, and all of these people. They're so focused and obsessed about the US market. They think the playbooks in the US work very well in Australia, and they undermine it because it is expensive but not expensive in the US, but the market size is small.
Sachee Perera | 12:48
Yeah. Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 13:01
They don't know that. It takes a lot of interpersonal relationships down here, building trust to actually make things go.
But once that is done, it is easier to move the needle. So, a lot of perspectives. I think the conversations came across and somewhat resonated with Bony and said, "Look, I know what it's like because I was in construction from 2012 to 2014."
I observed Bony in construction at that point in my life, all the way up. And I've seen how manual the things were, and I always kept wondering, why can't they have clouds? Like, using personal emails and all these things where you truly talk to these people today.
You know your timesheets. I used to sign up timesheets for 120 people towards the end of my career there. So, I see that manual things how it's going at that point in time. Google Suites are coming up. We tried to push and manage a bit of that, but you get a lot of pushbacks from the people.
Sachee Perera | 13:59
The was s.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 14:02
The people in the construction industry do have a certain mindset, but it has changed with the newer generations coming on.
That's fifteen around now, twelve years later. So, I think we picked off a bit of nerve. Is there like a kind of... I do understand we need to tap in, but the game is slightly different in Australia, so a lot of things.
Sachee Perera | 14:21
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 14:24
Yeah, that's bit me. Probably I just get to know how you are, and apart from what NA has told, just get to know how you are. How did this come And.
Sachee Perera | 14:40
Yeah. I'm actually supposed to take at least three to four months off on a holiday, but I spoke to Bonnie a couple of months ago because I was leaving the business, and I was like, "What do I do? I'm going to
get bored, so I'm leaving the business.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 15:00
Yeah, he.
Sachee Perera | 15:01
Okay, let's go and find something there. I was talking to Bonnie for some time, and then he was looking for a head of sales, I think.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 15:09
No.
Sachee Perera | 15:10
I think, just the conversations. It was very similar to what we did in our core plan and the previous business, specifically around the time sheets and whatnot.
So I thought this was interesting. I think the business has a very good minimum viable product here. We just need to figure out how to take it to market a little bit more effectively.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 15:38
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 15:43
I'm
been... The last couple of days, I've been trying to get up to speed on the construction industry because I'm not from the.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 15:52
Nine.
Sachee Perera | 15:52
[Laughter] It's really good to hear that you are actually signing off on the time sheets yourself.
So you know what it's like to be on the other side, Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 16:01
Yeah, I've been on that, not just time sheets. I used to do drafting in AutoCad. So I learned it way back. I used to do drafting in AutoCad. I learned it off pretty much because I grew up with it.
My dad was in engineering, and that's what I was surrounded with automation. SketchUp back in that time, I used to do all of those kinds of things before I transitioned here.
Sachee Perera | 16:26
No.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 16:29
So I know how much time-consuming it is.
The time in business is money when it comes to construction because in Australia, especially, they are not cheap. They're way more expensive than in your average workers.
Sachee Perera | 16:37
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 16:40
And, to waste time. Construction workers know if you don't guide them properly.
It's just like sometimes, even in sales, that's what I find. If you don't have people who are just self-accountable and you have a sense of direction, what are the top-level goals, and how can my small-level activities align with that? Same goes in construction.
People will come and stand there and stare until the founders tell you, "Okay, get this thing and do this thing." If there are any blockers, they get stuck. So, in part of the time sheets, the punch lists, what he was working on, he said that the compliance spot, we don't move that much these days, because we want to focus on one area, but yeah.
Sachee Perera | 17:24
So if you're from the industry, right?
And you're seeing, you're playing around with the product, you understand the product. Now, what do you think is the key problem it solves? Like.
And for whom? From your. Experiencey.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 17:44
Right. That's like a million-dollar question right now. I have faced when I came in. So, on the first day when I came in, I was talking with Bonnie. The thing is, I asked him to show me the product.
Right, because I chose to jump on board seeing the product. Nothing more like how things are going, what things are going. Because I want to see it from two angles. One, I had done this work in the past. A bit like the work we do, the second part is that I had in project management, I studied and I have a circle of friends who are obviously active in project management. They are like typical project managers.
So, I want to see from an angle what that looks like, what's relevant and what's not relevant. What is fluff, right? Then the sales point of S is like I like calling out fluff as early on as... So, when I look at the product, I was trying to understand what the founder's vision is.
Okay, where? Why Bonnie, you built this product, so what led you to build this product? Okay, we know, we all know. I feel this is more than an NVP because I have worked with startups in the past and I've seen products demote when I was part of the Microsoft Startups program. Leading things. Product is more than an MVP, but what led you to come to this where yet why are not be able to take off from where we start off and it took around two months after that to actually get hands-on into the product to me to play around.
So I had to go pressuring him for a bit. And very lately. Maybe just last month when he actually got access to the software for me to go around and say they were having some things they need to set in the background and all of this from my understanding, the product is more than an MVP, it has so many levers in it.
But if you take each individual module, there is no depth. It is for me, like, and I'll put it out blunt, because I have different stakes around it. It looks like it's the jack of all trades, but the master of none.
That's what the product looks like right now. Okay. And that is because when I'm joining the company, we have gone multiple iterations. The messaging was an all-in-one software to replace everything, alright, kind of thing. That's the idea that is in Boning's mind, marketing mind very fixated.
That's all in software to solve all of those areas, project management, scheduling, all of these timesheets and all this small timesheets schedule that's recently developed, all in one software dealing with all of these. The value proposition. You're going to replace established software in that space.
Maybe like Procore or maybe Autotask, Clouds or Deputy or Buildpass. You're going to replace that at a fraction of the cost, right? That's what the S and messaging I can get from the founders and find the marketing and to validate that, the origin of the software itself. How the software came into place. I hope he has told you that journey, right?
Like they started as a signage company. They started working with a TAFE, like doing a project scoping for them and found that they have a peculiar case where there is theft of manpower hours. And based on that, they built this software.
If this software has to be implemented for them, it could have probably saved $500,000 a year, right? So that's where it started off. Okay? Now, what we are right now is a product of what we see all of this.
So when I look into the software, my first instance is because I spoke to project manager friends of mine, who bra and always worked in this and they say we are all working at Procore and all of this. The thing is, where is our super strength if you're talking about project management and scheduling? Pretty much anything in the market, well-funded things like Monday.com, Notion, all these guys are out there as players, forget their traditional players.
So we can't see head-on with them. Right, because it is like we are very aggressive. We get in the market, we get in there. Then what is the strength individually in this space? And much more recently, when we started talking, we found customers who were resonating with timesheets and from timesheets, they scheduled the next level of scheduling.
So that is how we got our customer. We started working with them. The second customer is very much similar contractors in that space. Bonnie started slightly modifying the software, focusing more on those areas.
Then, when you started sensing that it was slowly working, let's start working on that kind of persona. So that's a journey. Now I fail the timesheets. With the last two months of whatever efforts have been done in the software side, timesheets area has improved. Now we can call that our little bit of a key highlight, the timesheets.
Maybe we are very close to Deputy in the consumer space. So this is my take on it. The project management side, the flip side is, yeah, it is a software, it is project management, it is efficient. All of those are there. The flip side is that project managers are very good. Most project managers are very savvy with Excel, Excel sheets, and English. They run a lot of the projects in Excel sheets. All the people I know are very savvy. They run all of those, and you get templates on run-off in Excel as a Gantt chart, right?
Then that's the product side. The product was built in mine for enterprise business with enterprise prices. That makes it very profitable when you sell the software to our business as if check in.
But they're like Bonnie, and probably even the marketing side, they are highly underestimated how the sales and deals work in an enterprise space. The time that is required, the multi-threading that is required, the hand-holding and on-site that is required to get that in through...
So I think the first instance they had a hand-burn running with Taif, probably spanning around eleven months. That's what brought it into... Let's try it in the market. When they are in the market, the mindset is we will sell it like an SMB, but the kind of clients we want to sell it to is mid-market.
That's how I understood that when I came in. And a fourth figure. So I can see the kind of sequencing email sequencing the clients that have been shortlisted and queuing that has been set for the marketing. You're looking at 25 million to 40 million to EBO-kind of companies to 200-300 for owners, top-level directors in the sequence.
Sachee Perera | 24:48
No. Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 24:56
But, you took... I'm this is my honest thing. They are taking it as easy as you're selling like an S&P into those businesses, which is very different. You might know which because core plans for pricing tell me you guys are mid-market. Enable you're now way like an SMB thing.
Sachee Perera | 25:13
Y.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 25:16
So that's where I think they got stuck with it as a team changing their mindset. Okay, you guys, define if you want mid-market and ABO, you're targeting 25 million and ABO where there is a board of people you need to sell across the board, and it takes time, it takes handholding.
So they got stuck, and then finally, the benchmarks dropped. Okay, let's move into SMB, 10 million, 12 million. Now we have gone down for five to eight million. That's how we came into a location. So all this happened in the span of under three months. Moving around. I'm giving a holistic understanding.
What I saw, what's changed, what are the things that are deterring boring and things. So when I'm coming in both the marketing and Bonnie wants to book an equip demo in two weeks, sell the two weeks, finish off the demo, finish the trial,
and sign off on the contract. That's what's going on in their mind. That is typically a good SMB practice, sometimes even very short. Very short for an SMB we want to execute that with marketke.
Sachee Perera | 26:36
Yeah. It's not.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 26:38
That change management had to be managed, and I had two people I had to manage through that, and for that, they had to really see what's happening there too. There's nothing we the way we went at it.
So you're not going to get you're not going to sometimes get an.
Sachee Perera | 26:49
Not.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 26:52
Door opened in the first, second, or third week. You had to work your way through it. So there is a lot of realistic calibration that has happened.
In the meantime, what has happened is we start, we saw that a few customers are talking to us.
Sachee Perera | 27:05
[Laughter].
Sandy Balakrishnan | 27:07
So one of them is Current Group, and another one is Slico. And then these customers... So what they want, although the number of people in the business is small, they have four to five million dollars of business.
When I started to show them their trial, that's when this is my honest feedback. That's when you realize the product has to have gaps.
Sachee Perera | 27:31
Mar.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 27:32
So there was naturally a little slowdown that was supposed to happen. We had the discussion, we are ready to go. We started the trial. We had a bit of hindrance in the first day of the trial. We were very fast. We figured it out in three weeks, came back to him and gave it to him, and then he underlined. He needs myob integration. My integration to another week and there were small things that were stopping him.
So on the fly, we are the product is getting built. The story is driven by the customer that is going.
Sachee Perera | 28:03
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 28:04
So my point, there are a few things over there. There are three categories: you need to position it rightly, and you need to see how much time and efforts they're taking. Is it going to be definitely... It's not enterprise at this stage because that needs depth in the product.
If you sell into it, I understand that if it is mid-market, and I honestly feel it will be mid-market, that makes sense for what they are thinking around it. Then you need to give the time and process and try to segregate. Then if you're doing SMB, that is more of a scale business. We can start working with it.
But I do feel the cost of acquisition at the beginning might be a little more. And then as gradually gets readjusted. So this is a holistic thing. If you ask me what is the strongest right in the product at the moment, I feel it's the timesheet. I wouldn't even jump to scheduling. With the kind of work they have put in the last one and a half to two months and the narratives, various timesheets, project management and all. I feel it is still a bit of fluff. That alone can't go and transform the value into space. What you're working for if you have to replace Monday.com or if you have to displace Procore...
These guys, project management... I used PrimerWare. I've been trained in Primer long back. Not now.
Sachee Perera | 29:25
He.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 29:25
I know how much of depth that has how much of microd element depth is there when they're when they run like large scale e PC or to key projects and EPC projects. The kind of depth that has in it that is in there.
So this is what I feel, this software at what right now data has come into it can work into time scales and schedule, time scats and scheduling, but it's a heavily computed space. It's a entirely, but you might have a different opinion. You have been coming and you have certainly grown something.
So probably I pick a brain on a you as well on itmm.
Sachee Perera | 30:08
I'm keen to understand the pain points here, like the time sheeting and scheduling. That seems to be the one that's most resonating from what I'm hearing. Right, you mentioned...
But then there's Fergus. There's obviously Procore. There's Asa that does a lot of.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 30:27
Yeah simp Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 30:32
So what is it that from what you understand right now, if we were just focus on the time sheets component, what in the Swift check in time sheets component that are do people why would people choose us?
Like, why would a construction company or whoever? Why would they choose Swift check in time sheet versus Deputy or Tanda or whatever or SIMPRO tradify pro Core or maybe not pro Core, you know, or SIM those ones.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 31:09
Right. So right now, at this current stage... One other thing is, we are a better value for money for them. The pricing based on the pricing we have, which is not the ideal thing we come up with in the front. We do have geo-fencing.
That is an advantage we had for a couple of months now. That might change very soon.
Sachee Perera | 31:34
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 31:35
So that is a huge advantage. What does it help us? It actually helps the company to know if the people are checking in on the site and they're physically present in the site. They can do that. That's my kind of monitoring. The people on the site, are they checking in, are they checking out?
Sachee Perera | 31:54
H.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 31:54
And all that other software does is here. That's one of the key highlights. We have that geo, we can define our site, we can see if the people are checking in and checking out on time on the site, if they are finishing the work earlier, have they overcoded the work, have they undercoded the work. It gives them a means to track those kinds of things.
It's a differentiator to most of our competitors. Most of them doesn't do that exclusively, but if we had done that now, it is a bit of a reactive kind of thing. We haven't gone to the real-time version of it. Real-time version is expensive. We had a requirement for the real-time version 1.
But like I said, it's easier said than done. The technical nuances of that, that's a key advantage there.
Sachee Perera | 32:39
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 32:42
Secondly, our interface, our interface and UIs are pretty simple. There are a lot of software that is simple, but I pretty much... We have a clean UI compared to our websites and all the things that we have, our UI is pretty neat and clean and easy to use. Self-explanatory. We don't have created much of a guide and all of this, but pretty much self-explanatory. Get to people, they can work it.
It's pretty easy once configured and running. It is pretty fast. The conferring and figuring it is a little slow. Logans. I would that's initially I seen I given that responses. But one is that it is pretty easy and fast to use.
There's a couple of things.
Sachee Perera | 33:24
How long does it take to confyt?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 33:28
The configuring doesn't take much time, but the first time logging in and the second time logging in, initially it was taking a bit of time. It was not smooth. This we slightly noticed when we got the first customer in the mobile variant. The reason I say that is at the moment we don't have an app version.
We have a browser version that opens in your phone.
Sachee Perera | 33:52
Okay. Yep. Got Gotch.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 33:54
Right? So imagine doing booking, imagine doing woolly shopping on a website in your phone and doing it in the woolly app. That's the kind of difference. Not every everyday has the latest software, latest drive kind of software as a phones that is working and maybe all forms.
So it varies. I gave them feedback around that pretty much. Bonnie and all of these people and Android people. I use my Apple phone. I'm very... I use that ecosystem. So when it comes across slightly different, I can know because we have a standard for apps or we have a standard for how it functions, but those are small things.
But if you take a top thing one, it does most of the things in timesheets. What other apps it does? Secondly, it's pretty intuitive. It's easy to use, easy to get on. One's running cost one, at the moment, those who know the value of it, it runs out to be pretty cheap for them because most of the other companies and I do can see them where they are coming from. They are funded companies when they are funded. The unit tech economics, I mean, goes in a different direction. A lot of the things are add-ons. The number of users you get charged for, the more people you have in the system, the more sites you have.
Sachee Perera | 35:14
Y.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 35:17
System system... We haven't put any blanket limit over there. We are slightly open there at the moment.
Sachee Perera | 35:23
Right.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 35:24
With. told them to keep some fair policies. We can work through that, in renewals and all of this, or until we come and run companies of that size, right?
So we work out to be very cost-effective for them at the current model. So these are some of the things that come across them.
Sachee Perera | 35:44
2Y1.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 35:44
And second thing is, timesheets are only a part of a thing. From timesheets, the businesses can build the whole other things.
From Pris, they can go into scheduling, and from scheduling, they can take into high level and go to project management. Other softwares are not at the moment. I'm not capable of that. I haven't reviewed them for a very small time. I need to get access and review all of those.
So that's a different thing from what I've seen with Deputy. We work with it. Those are not that easy in there. That's not their core area, so they don't dig into it. So our software helps them to scale.
If it's a small business, we can give them a hand with us. Start off with timesheets. They can work down to scheduling in our software, and then they can gradually go to a project management level. Admin work can be drastically reduced.
It's not just about taking time sheets. Overall, admin work and getting a bird's-eye view becomes easier for them. So these are the top things where you are positioned then for our advantage. Australian-based businesses. We understand Australian customers and handle it a lot better. Things in our businesses are set in a way how it works in Australia where there are rotos of contractors engaging, all of those are there.
So this is where it is. Again, when I'm coming in, they had done a deep research on software. What are all the spaces? Nisha does it. She has an expansive list of 70-71. I've seen a couple of times these days. I try to gather it from the customer of what they are using, the kind of customer we are reaching, what they are really using.
So the narrative is slightly changing. SIMPRO comes up to be number one thing that they are using up. SIMPRO comes up a lot of times there are businesses that are using Zero and trying to cover this up as well. With Zero we are yet to understand. What are the other things? I'm pretty short of time. She might be manual for them. They're trying to work with Zero, YB and covering that.
So that's a few things. Fergus has come up one or two times. So these are the things we're seeing. But SIMPRO is quite right. Now, the Yellow Pages, what we're working with, typically you're looking at businesses. 344 to 5 million down trades. The real trade is the hands-on trades of Australia. Those people, a lot of them, are on SIMPRO. What you're talking about, there are a few in Fergus. Then they have very rare names coming like Arca X and all. They are like HCM, an extension of a pair SLA HR software that is com.
So there's one narrative of reassuming how it is. Then right now, I said, it's very important to understand what these guys have against the world I come from. We even use battle cards, but if I need to set the value cards and set that because we need to move into a cell motion, we might be replacing or we might be competing. We need to kind of understand who the competitors in that space are, as in who is the majority they're using.
Then probably we need to set the narratives because that'll be a hard-core selling notion at the moment, the way it is, the way Bonnie is envisioned.
Sachee Perera | 38:51
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 38:56
They haven't generally factored that into it.
They thought it's like this is my first instance with that, like two months of what I've seen. When you're going through it, there are customers there just maybe working with Excel and all of those. They don't hire other software. We are the first one probably calling into them.
Yeah. So that they are coming on board and joining this and seeing this getting WOD in the winter on. But in reality, it is that a lot of them has some parts of some software. Some of them, contrary to what we think, they have a very expensive software as well, like Procore and these ones, but they're not probably using it like for a compliance point and just keeping the software.
I know how it is in the construction. We had to keep some software for compliance, like if you had to submit drawings and get approvals. We need to have Autodesk drawing licensing over here. But we are not going to draft or make changes.
That's how we use it. So if you right now fail in the last one month, timesheet narrative is slightly working with the space we have moved into, but we have to move into a very strong selling notion.
So I would highlight timesheets. I wouldn't give too many brownie points into project management or scheduling in that space.
Sachee Perera | 40:20
You mentioned it really important there.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 40:20
And H2, good question. The Yellow Pages motion started early, first of this month, so we are just on the second week of it.
Sachee Perera | 40:23
So you're not coming across a lot of people that are just using pen and paper and spreadsheets. Most of them have... Is it more than 50% of the people? Through Yellow Pages, for example, are using some sort of system? Or are you... Is it like 50?
Okay.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 40:53
Okay, so for 130 contact companies, we took in a little effect. 50% of them are in IVR automated IVR. I'm not talking about the you can go in plus one, two, three and can talk to sales customer success.
So we are only able to talk to very small texts. Around 2015 to 20 people have actually spoken to us. Forget the point of contact decision-maker, anybody who has spoken to us on the call.
So, it's a very small subset at the moment. To actually get it, if you take from that, let's just say around 20 or something at the moment, it looks like 20 to 30% are the people who are like spreadsheets and on Excel.
But here's the thing: these people are extremely small businesses. That's what I'm trying to understand. One person to five people. Why would they need this software when they are literally like our business, our C-suite people? We talk to each other.
So, why would I put a complicated software in place? I send him my TE sheet. He sends in his TE sheet. I'm trying to understand this because the subset is very small, calling the whole people like that with a small subset, I think it is a little dangerous.
So, I thought, expand the subset. Let's take the whole month. In a month, I would be at least able to get across 300 to 350 accounts. Because on one side, that account is getting somebody scrubbing manually and making that account fade it into the backend, right? We have a person over here who's doing it.
So, that is what is happening. There are people. To answer your question, there are people. At the moment, maybe ten to 15 at the max, 20 people in Excel, Timesheets, and no particular software in place.
Sachee Perera | 42:38
Yeah. How can I see the... See that list of Yellow Pages contacts and the progress, like the names of the companies, the contacts? Is that in HubSpot? Or is that in Dialpad Or.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 42:54
So that is maintained in an Excel sheet. Do you have a... Okay, you have a... I'll just share that. You'll be able to see that. Okay? Just shared with you.
I'll just quickly give me a moment. We'll be able to screen share and show you what you're looking at, and I'll tell you why it's
run in an Excel in a bit, so this is the sheet. Alright, so Kavia is working directly on this sheet. I kept it simple because we are not running into a CRM yet.
So you got your companies over here. Normally, when this list starts, it's pretty clean. You don't get first names and last names from various scrubbing and bringing it in. I had done manual enrichment as well, just because it's Cellar Pages. These are the numbers, some of them she has populated. You get your suburbs, you get your emails, and you get your phone numbers. Most of them are the generics, and we are segregating the categories here. What kind of industries they are based in and then the basic, what do you require? A website, pin codes. You'll find the call notes over here, but you're going with it. Have given like a call item number.
If it's a first call or second call or third call, keep updating on it and this is email send. This is if it's a decision maker. It's easy to know if it's a decision maker and it's in a drop-down, which is still an admin. You'll get it.
If you have captured the admin names, it'll be there. Of course, there are demos and all of those that are there, but this is how that sheet runs. Okay, now there's a second sheet. These are calls that have been totally disconnected that we are working on later. Then there is the data.
If you go to the data tab, they have segregated so this keeps updated. We keep updating that. So, there's a rejected list of contacts, then there are gatekeepers and computers. So, these are people who spoke to us, so they want what you asked for. You'll probably be finding it over here like most of the day, most of the week. We keep updating it over here. What do you spoke to? What's the software where they are at? You'll get that from here.
As much as we are, we are collecting the name even if it's an adman who we are speaking to. We are at that point. This is the white list of IVS that happen.
Sachee Perera | 45:39
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 45:39
So IVS, like I said, a lot of them are full voice banks or absolutely automated, which makes a large number of them.
Sachee Perera | 45:48
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 45:49
Then we have a slot for bookings. We keep updating there.
These are invalid numbers. I give a round of enrichment myself. If it's possible, I keep it. Otherwise, I'll just gradually eradicate it at the end of the month. Just doing a bit of drilldown on what the numbers look like. This has to be updated because I have just given her a new list straight to it.
So this is pretty much what you're looking at. Does this help you?
Sachee Perera | 46:17
Yeah. And are the calls being recorded where you can hear the conversations or not? Really?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 46:23
So all calls are recorded. So I have put a system in place so all the calls are kind of recorded. I use Dialpad. So there are two things. I can download the calls and I can put it, into a folder. Or I have set up the system where you can hear the calls.
Sachee Perera | 46:41
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 46:41
Like most of the call, say, by default, it is recorded. It will. It will, read out the mandatory thing.
Sachee Perera | 46:49
Four four.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 46:49
So by default, the calls are recorded. A lot of them. I have created the disposition list. A fairly decent disposition list to say like if it is connected, if it's a gatekeeper. When you have the plugins later, we can organize that so you can find the calls over here. Which one do you want to go and grab?
If you want to grab a bunch of calls, pull them out. I can pull out a bunch of calls because that's how I shared it over here in sales calls. When they wanted a couple of calls, I started putting it here so I can bring out the calls.
It's not too much of a hassle. I can just download a whole bunch of calls and put them over here. Then you can see them. At the moment, they are not mapped. It is phone numbers, so you'll have to cross-match the phone numbers. We'll need to get the licenses up and we need to connect them in the CRM. Probably this will take up as a connect, but this does it. You can find the calls over here, you can download them, you can listen to them.
Yeah, this is how I'm capturing it. When I came in, it wasn't... They never had any recordings. They were using sales agencies. They were running it themselves. This is ground zero. What software we had, they never knew that, so they were using support licenses. There's no recording, anything.
So then it took literally four weeks to go through the dialer and set the dialer in the first place. I was doing all of those over there so that I wanted the recordings to be there so that you can look back into the recordings and plan accordingly.
So my early coaching for Kavia had to start off from there as I can do a call listening in as well. I've been doing that with her in the beginning.
Sachee Perera | 48:32
And have you.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 48:33
She wasn't.
Sachee Perera | 48:34
Have you integrated HubSpot into the dial
you can have... So you can push the calls into HubSpot yet? Or is that still on your to do?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 48:44
That still needs to be done for that. We need to go into the pro-level licenses of that and we need to finish off that. I brought it up to Bonnie. I'm allowed to do that when that is done.
Sachee Perera | 48:53
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 48:56
The list that she's working on has to be brought into HubSpot at the moment.
Sachee Perera | 48:59
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 49:00
The Yellow Pages, it's a massive list. We haven't brought all of those into there.
Sachee Perera | 49:03
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 49:05
What we agreed on is we keep quality leads, don't flood the whole system with the leads. Ideally, I like it to run from the CR.
That's what I want to go with it.
Sachee Perera | 49:17
No.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 49:17
But I was working in the beginning, when we were looking around different CMS they want to work with so who they want to do this. There was HubSpot who was already there. The agent was very slow when she was going to work with that.
We are at a space at the start of Excels, the fastest way to do it.
Sachee Perera | 49:33
One.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 49:33
I can take it anywhere. When it's an L, it's a matter of pushing and pulling into the CR, right? So what I did right now is if there are leads like yesterday, there was a decent call.
I'll just probably give you the recording as well, so that'll help you. That was a decent call. What I did is I pulled that from there and I created the account here. Am I still sharing the screen?
Sachee Perera | 49:58
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 50:00
Get a second.
Right, good. So this is what I've done. Yesterday there was a decent call. There's a chance of a meeting getting booked. So I pulled that account and created it under HubSpot. I have done the notes, free studies, and accounts. Everything over here. We used HubSpot itself to send the emails because I can see the trackers all over here.
Sachee Perera | 50:30
I.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 50:31
So that's what we've done. So ideally, if a good lead is working properly, if it's a warm lead, I can bring it over here and maintain the whole activities down here. So I think that's a transition kind of thing I'm doing with her as well to come down and work from here because what I felt there were many elements moving when I came in with tellers and this. Now when I started HubSpot itself, everything was trying to figure out over there very slow.
Sachee Perera | 50:47
Okay.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 51:01
She might be able to get eight or nine ACS engaged, and we wanted to go through a massive list.
So I said, "Alright, I'll get you Excel, you get the volumes, I'll figure out the remaining.
Sachee Perera | 51:11
Y Yp.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 51:12
First I need to see how that ends. So I did. That is fast for her. Then I just jumped into being like an IC executive founding iconic.
I will build it in the CRM it.
Sachee Perera | 51:25
1.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 51:26
And now these days I show her this is how it should be. This is how you need to look at multiple elements. And there weren't any trackings when I'm coming in, and that is surprising for me. The marketing hasn't kept any kind of... When I say there is demand, how is the demand? You spoke to 25 people. When you're doing this product design, is that what you consider demand or how did the demand came?
Sachee Perera | 51:50
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 51:51
So that wasn't Catcher. So that only happened like a month earlier when they put that trackers from HubSpot into the website. So now we can we have this. I think I'm pretty sure you have seen this kind of things before.
It's the buyer intend the people who are coming to our website. We have the people just love these are the people who are coming to our website in the last 30 days we sow who are visiting and probably, we can see which page they are kind of visiting like this is so there has been an ad scheduling last minute changes.
Sachee Perera | 52:25
Yep.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 52:30
So they are looking at that and they are coming to our pages. So this system was only implemented. I think it's the fourth week that just happened.
Sachee Perera | 52:37
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 52:39
We had HubSpot for a very long time. Marketing was a very long time. I was like, if we had this from the very early times, we would have known who was coming to our website.
Sachee Perera | 52:48
Y.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 52:49
Put a face to the people. Then we discovered, like I said, this is there. The people who are researching top topics. Now I'm not sure how accurate HubSpot is and how relevant, how real-time that data is, but from here you can see the topics that they are researching. We have created a filter timesheets and just for timesheets and scheduling. People who are being researched in this field.
What I do is I handpick the list, add it to the CRM, and from the CRM, I manage it. So if you want to see what I've done, I have seen they are working on timesheets and scheduling. I picked this account and I started working my way.
So again, they are a call lead. They're just in the market. The assumption is they are researching the topics. So I populated all of this data, put the face into it, started calling them and working my way up. How do you do mid-market just like that at the start going through and on each stage with them, working my way up.
So that has created a bit of movement. But it's all again, it's been only two weeks, you start working with it. I have seen people reading when it's very personalized and very relevant to run, so I'll show you one more.
Sachee Perera | 54:09
So is there a list of your shortlisted accounts that you're engaging with at the moment?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 54:19
Yeah, I'm curating it over here. There is a list over here.
Sachee Perera | 54:22
Okay. It's in the lists. Okay.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 54:24
Yeah, but it's an early stage. I would need a couple of days to come down to a meaningful one. I'll show you where it is.
So I put it under Topic research list ALR, so those are people who are looking for the topics in the market. So I started putting them in the companies under there, the businesses who are looking into these topics.
So that's the understanding. Out of that big list, I am just handpicking some of the businesses. So we came to an understanding. We will target businesses probably under ten million and keep it probably under 50 employees at the moment. Something that we can actually land a quick win in terms of sale.
So those kind of accounts, there are a few, one or two things that are large. That is because everything that comes up over here in the research list is not 100% straight. That is that they may come up like this blank, but when you go into that account, you realize there are a lot of people.
So this is some things that need to be removed. But this is where I capture it. I bring the topic research, try to keep it to the ICP, and try to bring it into the icon, and then start working on it from here.
So that's where I maintain my ones. All of this, we manually populated. I'm trying to find a way. I know where it is. SA does it, but Apollo, I'm working with Zapia to get that integration sorted. So this is what it looks like.
To do a bit of AC study, send it to the emails. If it's emails, then you start calling into them. So the emails that I sent are very personalized. I look at multiple social media platforms to understand that I know they are open.
So I'm working my way down. So that is the guy within the business. You know their profiles. So this is what I think you're looking after, right?
Sachee Perera | 56:18
And are you getting responses from these yet?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 56:22
Emails, no, but when I start slowly working into calls, I can see that it's moving.
I know they are getting opened, some of them. I can see they are getting clicked. So that is like they are noticing us. And some of them, tax accounting, the whole things, these things only started, like I said, it's been barely two weeks in, very early stages, but I find it is actually working from nothing happening to work working because everything is correlated at this stage, literally correlated, right?
Sachee Perera | 56:51
Yes. Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 56:53
And number one thing I need to say is that everything is correlated, but there has to be a strategy in even the correlation. What you are looking for is not into businesses that have been heavily sold out. Probably the businesses that have some buyer intent.
So this seems to have some intent. There is something we can relate to when you're going into the business and talking to them. So I find there is momentum. But it's like I need to work my way from again, admins to the directors and start coming.
So some of the examples of what I found as working in short time is... This is an account. They happened to visit a website for some reason and we started reaching out to them. There's a project manager we have sent it to her.
Then we started seeing we sent it to the next person. It is tied down to an event they were having. We can see they have opened it two or three times, they have clicked it two or more times. That means they have gone through the links. Now I'm trying to work my way that this software system will be able to show that if they are coming back and visiting our website or they are going to our pricing pages.
So we are doing a 360-degree approach to the customer. They're responding to emails, picking up calls, looking at the website, doing research, and creating a whole circle.
I have seen this method and used to do that in other businesses as well. The same thing, more like an A account-based marketing.
Sachee Perera | 58:21
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 58:21
So that's what it looks like. But then when that setting is done, I want to scale it up. I find that will be effective.
Yellow Pages, of course, the volume is happening there. Yesterday we had a customer. Yeah, almost had it. They almost said yes to it. So that is pretty good. I brought that into CR myself.
Those that are working and getting into warm leads, we'll bring it down here. We'll work it there for the time being, just to get the volume and things.
Sachee Perera | 58:48
Y yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 58:52
We are doing a lot of numbers. This is not just the list we had done. This is one of the lists we had done.
If you ask me, there were two, three different types of campaigns we had done in between, we are like there are a lot of pivots in a short period of time.
Sachee Perera | 59:08
Sandy, that's some phenomenal work you've done so far, like bring everything together.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 59:08
So yeah, I know that.
Sachee Perera | 59:13
It's a lot in a. In less than three months.
So which is? It is awesome to hear.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 59:22
The thing is, when I was with my... There were sales engine businesses, they were building X engine and all.
So, I was part of three to four pilot programs for Microsoft. I know it's totally messy. When you start from scratch, when I came in, I expected the same to happen.
Sachee Perera | 59:38
One.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 59:41
That's why I said, "Look, let me see what the forms look like." One of the heads... What I had was I'd worked with people. Kavia was very new and it's not her fault.
Right. We picked her up. She's a good person, but it's just she hasn't experienced what it's like to be in a beta web space. So, there's a lot of gaps that had to bridge at the time. Go back and... Right now she has come into that zone, okay? She can talk with admins.
The second hurdle is that now you have to work with Australian businesses. You know what it's like from calling from an offshore person from Australia, according to it. So, there are massive gaps that we have to bridge. We are to bridge two jumps. One, as a sales rep, you come into a market level. The second is you bridge that international seller level.
So, all of those are happening. I the first thing is, well, there's not been much progress in the demo. I would say the Solitude demos have gone in. The two ones are pretty decent and solid. I usually say they probably end of this month they get into their trials, they're moving in or... Yeah, sorry, yeah, Slico, yeah, current group.
Sachee Perera | 01:00:49
Is this, Cor group and LY? Is this current group and SLY? Current Group and SLY, yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:01:01
So the profile that you're talking to. Current Group is a Project Edwin guy in the business, but he has a high say in the business. If you take the top three people in the business, he is the three people running that SLY.
It is the CFO we are talking with. And it just happened that this June and July is the end of the financial year. You know how busy it gets. So they generally want to push it a little down with the Gena. So that's the thing that is happening down there.
So that's the two ones that happened. So we are trying to understand the kind of profile there that gave some signal. So what didn't work when you came in the first time? So the way of marketing did is I'll just show you where you're at. It'll be easier. I'm pretty sure you have got the access. Give me a se.
Sachee Perera | 01:01:56
Yeah. Okay, I'll do this at the end before we wrap up today in terms of access. But yeah, carry on. I'd like to see what you're showing.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:02:06
Yup. So we got here, so we got the Apollo over here, so this is where the marketing used to send. So this is what they used to send the emails and sequences and the kind of profiles they send.
Sachee Perera | 01:02:21
One.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:02:23
So this was when I was coming in, they were doing like four weeks sequence. So I waited out to finish two sequences. I don't want to disrupt. I want to see what's saving. There'll be a reason why they did what they did, right? Then you can work into it.
So these are the two things they have done in that time it took. There was a sequence of four emails already set with marketing. I think it expanded into May. The stats are in terms of deliveries and clicks and all, but there's literally no more than one or two replacements. There was literally no replacement.
The profiles they reached out to were in the Zillow and the owner and director of construction companies. At that point in time, they hadn't kept... These are the profiles they reached out to.
So this was May and pretty much in April. The reach they were reaching out to a lot of them. So a lot of them is easier. There's a mix. Now this is a mix of accounts. You can see the activities they run. Two sequences, from the marketing, which I came in the middle of when I was engaging. Then we did a slightly different sequence that is for project admins and project managers. That was a very tight one we did.
It's called Mint. Let me just share that as well. Wait a second. Says cost. Okay, I'll just share that one as well. That's fine. So this is where they used to do the sequencing. I'm using the same thing for the data enrichment. In terms of contacts and finding the people. Apollo is the source I go to, and the SA one is the personal one I'm keeping over there.
It's a free icon, but this is a paid one. We are using much of the contact enrichments if we want to do the sequencing that's happening down over here. And marketing is pretty much handling this.
There is a domain for this one. I think it's Nick. It's called the Nick. The email is set under the Nick. That's where it is going from.
Sachee Perera | 01:04:30
Okay, yeah. Lots of... Yeah, that very low in terms of responses from those cases. It slammed by these emails now. Anyway, so.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:04:44
That's a problem. Yeah, I mean, maybe you're a family. The thing is, the last two or three years, that space has evolved a lot.
Sachee Perera | 01:04:52
One.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:04:53
Automated sequencing is happening a lot. Emails and even LinkedIn, it is getting swamped. Not just over here, we've seen those things happening. No one rights and one second thing is, they were all core leaks.
So I think it's normal.
Sachee Perera | 01:05:09
YI just need to understand the product and everything a little bit better here, because, just going back to.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:05:10
You see that happening. So there are a couple of moving elements. I think your expertise helps us to figure out how to source those leads. When you were with CorePlan, you would have gone through similar things like sourcing those kinds of leads.
Maybe it's slightly different for you in mid-markets and ABo, right?
Sachee Perera | 01:05:41
Yeah, just time sheets and scheduling.
I think I need to go and jump into HubSpot and look at all of the emails. I noticed that I actually don't have access to it. Do you have super admin access in HubSpot?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:05:58
I have a super admin access here.
Sachee Perera | 01:06:01
I can't see emails or calls or anything, so you need to go and enable it.
I think it's for me to see emails and calls from C on.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:06:13
Okay.
Sachee Perera | 01:06:14
I can't see emails and calls. For example, in insurance building, I can only see the notes that you have left. I can't send for emails or calls.
If you. If you can help me with that access.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:06:31
Right, I can probably... I'll swap the access there. Give me a sign. Let me have a look at it. Alright, I'll make a point, I'll do that.
Sachee Perera | 01:06:41
Yeah, so access to calls, sorry, when you go, it'll show you tasks, notes, calls, email for every deal and the deals. I think I have the deal. I think I have access to deals that would be good for me to look at.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:07:02
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:07:04
Do you think you can send me like, the three biggest hottest leads that you're working on?
That is like not current group, not sl y the three horus companies that you think so I can shad and then do you have any meetings or demos coming up that you have booked?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:07:25
Not right now, none. We don't have anything. Maybe in this coming week we might be able to find the Stray from Kavia. We have one in LA, we just sent it to him. I brought it to CRM.
So we don't have any upcoming ones?
Sachee Perera | 01:07:41
Okay, that's fine.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:07:42
Yeah, we haven't any, we don't have any MQLs at the moment as well. But we'll definitely book you in. Not a problem anyway. We're setting in the Australian time definitely.
Sachee Perera | 01:07:56
Yeah, that's cool, and you can send me the recordings that you showed.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:07:59
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:08:03
I don't have access to OneDrive, I only access to Zoho. Maybe if you can just drag and drop that into Zhofiler.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:08:11
I will put in yeah, I'll put in a bunch of those into it over there.
Sachee Perera | 01:08:11
Al.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:08:16
I'll probably exclude the IVs. We say I vs. is pretty going there and listening to their voice mail.
That's pretty much it. Conversations. I put it there's mostly up over there. I'll just try and put it over there.
Sachee Perera | 01:08:23
Yes. Yes. And are there recorded demos of the product?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:08:32
We have.
Sachee Perera | 01:08:32
If.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:08:32
We two have.
Sachee Perera | 01:08:33
If you can.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:08:34
I thought Bonnie shared that with you. Recordings, daily check-in, trial set-up.
Okay, I'll put a note. I'll share that with you as well. We have current groups, and we have Slico, I believe. Yeah, we do have Slico, we'll have a look. They are in teams. I'll share that with you as well.
Sachee Perera | 01:08:59
And current electrical contractor.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:09:00
Okay, yes, they are an electrical contractor.
Sachee Perera | 01:09:02
Right?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:09:06
Yeah, we had a couple of meetings with them.
Sachee Perera | 01:09:10
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:09:10
So, in that course, the discovery happened in the demo calls. Because the way it was when I'm coming in, the way they wandered is like "book a demo".
Normally I do the qualification and all those but the process and all it can come in place. I just hold back the process for the same reason and not what the set of the whole CL met. So call and put in the demo.
But in the demo, I joined with Bonnie. I was doing the discovery in the call, and then Bonnie jumped into the demo, and Bonnie helped through that demo thing. So that's the first time I'm getting to see how the demo to the clients, what they're doing with it. There are a few of the old ones, the Bonnie shared with the customers. There are a few demos which Bonnie gave himself, as well over there.
Sachee Perera | 01:10:02
Okay.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:10:03
Yeah, we haven't created a deck for it because that is something that the process has to be slightly defined.
Sachee Perera | 01:10:09
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:10:10
The thing is, our demo at the point, both our demos include a demo plus discovery. Normally we do that discovery slightly earlier than this, but the way the leads were done at that point, it was slightly doing and checking into the demo.
Kendra was not at the point to even do the qualification kind of thing. So it was like, "Okay, make the booking in." It's her expectation that the Bonnie hiring set an appointment kind of thing.
Sachee Perera | 01:10:41
One.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:10:41
But I think that's something we work with. It's just two months. We'll work and create that process. I need to get the licenses, the higher licenses in HubSpot to set the stages in the trial. I did a two-week trial. I set the stages, and the workplace and dashboards.
So only come in sales subs, like the sales subro, like a lead. You go to the lead opportunity proposals and that kind of stages.
Sachee Perera | 01:11:08
Yeah, I think I'll be able to get a startup discount.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:11:08
Yeah, that's it.
Sachee Perera | 01:11:12
For HubSpot. That should be the professional plan, and but I think that's we need to do a couple of things first before we set up.
Yeah, time sheets.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:11:26
You it. Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:11:29
Yeah. All right, Matt, this has been really helpful. I am going to go and review the calls once you share them with me. I'd love to really hear what Kahoot is saying and what people are saying.
Listen to watch one more calls and into shadow the three hottest leads that you think you're chasing right now. To really get an understanding of where we are in terms of the product.
Yeah, Keen, I think we just need to dig deep enough to keep here.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:12:08
Yeah, just asking out of curiosity.
Sachee Perera | 01:12:09
And, yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:12:13
So how is it with the Core Plan? Is it something similar building up or... We came into a little later stage with Like.
Sachee Perera | 01:12:22
We were doing everything, and our product was, like you said, a jack of all trades, master of none. We really had to say no to a lot of things and focus on one area and just do that really well.
What I did was just do... Across the business, align everyone on the same vision of what we're going to build, how we're going to sell, how we're going to continue to build, what's next meter.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:12:54
Yeah. Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:13:00
And difference was that the competition was mostly really old school or pen and paper. So, whereas over here, from what you're saying, there's a lot of competition.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:13:20
It's, yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:13:21
Which is a good thing. Which means people should be more educated on the problem.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:13:28
So that's the thing, one of the things I'm really looking into continuously is one of the things I noticed in that segment, Norman has a majority in this segment.
Sachee Perera | 01:13:38
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:13:39
So if you take accounting in Australia, Zero is a leader. MYB is the second CKBOOK age the second space. If you take Cloud AWS, Azure GCP, some people have a vast majority in this space, so it's super segmented. Even pro core, they have like single digits solely, even if you look at it from what it is: pro core in the Australian market, in the Australian market, when you're looking at that segment, when you took all of the construction and all of this.
Sachee Perera | 01:14:03
Or globally?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:14:14
So that's something I've noticed. The market is like with a lot of people for different reasons. I think we'll get to know more closely when we work with it. That's something I'm trying to observe or understand. When we went into Yellow Pages, which is giving us information from grassroots level rather than we were going to the businesses at that point.
Sachee Perera | 01:14:33
Yeah. Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:14:38
I didn't make the change to run business, which is like what's working following the trend in those businesses like we have in place. We don't want to entertain.
Pretty much it's a standard thing. Even an admin would tell you that we have everything in place. We don't want to shoot an email. We'll pass it to that kind of things.
Sachee Perera | 01:14:54
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:14:56
And has come back as one such company. We had a demo, a project engineer business having around 25 million in revenue. The demo pretty much showed no interest to any part. I had to kind of jump in and guide the demo, around to find where she's picking the cues.
Sachee Perera | 01:15:16
1.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:15:16
But I feel like it wasn't qualified. I'd like to get that qualified in, but it wasn't qualified. One that was a lack of qualification. But at the end we came to know, let's say, the obvious list that we have, we do have Brokor at the top end. Then we have planning and scheduling software, Microsoft Project. All of those are in place for it. Timesheets like Deputy, Tradify, all of those are there.
But I think it is shaping up the narrative to timesheets and scheduling. Just take it from me, it has just developed in the last four weeks.
Sachee Perera | 01:15:49
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:15:50
And it stood, where it started originating and slaying to versus when you went mass, it didn't work. As an all-in software, we found one or two clients clicking on timesheets and scheduling, and when we put the trackers, we found people are researching around that.
Then we said, let's run a campaign in this narrative. So we planned around June a small campaign for just Melbourne, particular segment close in hand with marketing, and then Yellow Pages said, "Let's select.
Sachee Perera | 01:16:15
He.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:16:19
Let's source it ourselves, not rely on the platforms." Because if I have access to Apollo, I'm pretty sure there are hundreds of businesses that have access to it. The same list, and you're going to it. There's nothing unique about the proposition of those.
So I said, "Let's source it." Let's get it and source it from it. That's how Yellow Pages happened. Then we started putting it, and I found there was more valuable insight coming from it. Demos are one thing.
I'll get to the demos, I'll get to the selling part, but I understand that's what the customers can do. Can we get that customer? What are the customers like? What do they play with? Where are they stuck? What's the kind of revenue?
So this is the typical from mind. My idea was like, okay, they will be the typical businesses. Four to five people in the business making a million and a half million a year. The kind of trade is...
If you're in Sydney, you'll know the kind of. The people at Cera. You do this for all the builders and people like family businesses. Five, six cousins in the place running it. Maybe one, two, $3 million businesses they're running, but it'll be in hand in books and papers. The wife is doing the accounting, handling all of those, the typical Australian way.
Coming closer and working with Andrew in the later stages, we discovered that it's cable that they may have. Sometimes they have 20-30 contractors under him. They're working with just... By looking at their payrolls.
Sachee Perera | 01:17:42
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:17:47
Payrolls can even add up to one and a half million. That means that businesses are five million, even if they are 20-30 people.
Sachee Perera | 01:17:52
Andrew is from the current group or Silco?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:17:53
Yeah, current group.
Sachee Perera | 01:17:57
Current group?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:17:59
Yeah, in our very last meeting that came up when you were talking to me and Bonnie, we were sitting and just doing a little math. Okay, there are three people showing up. So that's the thing. Then the more important pricing thing, we had to push it a while to carry it out. That again came down early last month. Funny was I know it's the best thing, but having something in a vision of what the pricing and all, the segmentation of the features, how do you differentiate? Low, mid, high tiers, you know, because that gives us.
Sachee Perera | 01:18:35
Yeah. Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:18:37
For everybody, even the seller gives us away. This is the differentiation, whichever way we're going to go.
So that needed a lot of handholding, and you got it last month in the pricing. I think Bonnie had an expectation of different pricing, but that is a later thing. But you need to at least see it as segments. The reason I'm putting that up there is because until then, the story is very vast and open. I the problem. I told you like you understand like the jack of all trades, master none of the software. Then the narrative below that is wide and open. After one to three calls even with the Andrew till late we haven't said about the pricing.
Yeah, absolutely asked you twice. A pricing at that point in time. But we haven't Bonnie's come out with the pricing what it looks like. So we had to really me and marketing had to really push the price, come out with a price.
We will work the scales and esthetics, but we need something.
Sachee Perera | 01:19:41
Yeah, that's good to alright.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:19:43
So, it's like.
Sachee Perera | 01:19:45
That's very good. Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:19:49
So, the way he wanted to say is like, I get my first twenty customers and I'll come up with a pricing model for that.
Sachee Perera | 01:19:56
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:19:57
But the salesman in me could sense it. From Bonnie. Bonnie's original vision is probably each point the software is sold at least somewhere at 40K per customer and annually the least maybe 20K I felt. See that price is not a big provo in mid-market or the bigger businesses but in SMBs like it has to be envisioned in a different way if you want to get across the needle.
Sachee Perera | 01:20:17
4.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:20:25
They are they can.
But yeah, these are all moving elements. There were so many moving elements. But that's why I asked if it works. And one always compares pricing with I'll pass a couple of times he used to keep comparing with the US.
Well, core plan. The noise was there for a while. Hey, they're doing a thousand and above how they are doing it. But then I had a close look at following your customer thing when you guys had your first rise.
I think around thirty customers you go on the year. If I look from here to here, around 100 customers. From all the data I'm looking at, you got around 100 customers there, maybe more than that. This is only the new you can get outside, but doing the math, I can find they are probably mid-market spenders in that segment. You'll be okay with 100 customers because the billings from them are good.
So.
Sachee Perera | 01:21:15
Enterprise it was s enterprise H the producted in matter of two years.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:21:16
H?
Sachee Perera | 01:21:27
So yeah, which was very different. So we're serving SMB mid-market and enterprise, so now it's an enterprise SaaS, which is fun, but sales cycles are long, so, which is good, but bad, they can pay upfront.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:21:38
He? Yeah, I know.
Sachee Perera | 01:21:50
Cash flow is sorted today. It has been very helpful. Thank you.
I think I have quite a lot of information from you, and I'm going to hit you up later this week as well, if that's okay. If I can have a once I've digested a lot of the info from today. Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:22:08
Like, I know, I took it through a lot of things, but the thing is, from a sales perspective to another person, it's solved. It's easier to convey a lot of the things you can find what's working, what's bad, and I don't feel holding back information.
Sachee Perera | 01:22:19
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:22:25
When I came in, that's what I said. There's no history of what sales happened other than the two agencies being involved.
I told him, "Look, I want to bring it to a system and I want to be scalable." Thing.
Sachee Perera | 01:22:36
Do you have any, were there any calls? No calls recorded from any of the agency work. Nothing. Okay.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:22:47
No, that is my biggest surprise. No, I mean, if they had booked demos, the demos will be there.
Sachee Perera | 01:22:53
Hey.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:22:53
There were no calls at the end of it. They had a list given to them, and that's when I realized the hindsight over there. The first time I was talking with them, it was like ground zero.
Sachee Perera | 01:23:04
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:23:04
M and that is another thing. At that point, they said they have gone across thousand 800 companies calling them.
Sachee Perera | 01:23:12
Okay.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:23:12
And, for me, it's like, "You've gone through it." The day I'm coming in with the slide, the pitch just said that you are looking at 3000 and the total service will open the market. I'm like, "If that number is right, that is half of the market. Probably, it's a huge thing, mainly I was singing like so how and you'll run out of releases sooner than you think if that's the reality of it.
Sachee Perera | 01:23:29
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:23:37
So there was nothing. That's why the first thing I could put in place took time, four weeks because there were so many issues. The licenses were tagged to the agencies, and the agency people wouldn't talk to him. I had to come in and cancel the whole dialer, start a fresh dialer, and then move into the way it was set in the call centers where you do monitoring.
Sachee Perera | 01:23:52
Al right?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:23:57
And because for me, there is another way to coach. Effectively, to coach that she needed the hand-holding in the beginning. So the good thing is in the first month, one and a half months, we are testing a couple of dialers.
Sachee Perera | 01:24:10
Yes.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:24:10
But most of the calls we got in the camps were there. It is there. I built it for whoever comes in and takes over. They should have some references. The higher the licenses here, you can bring it into HubSpot, you can connect it across those. They are possible, but that's all in place.
Sachee Perera | 01:24:26
Sorry. How much does Dad cost you?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:24:26
And how much?
Sachee Perera | 01:24:30
Do you know how much DALL-E costing?
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:24:34
$202 for two licenses.
Sachee Perera | 01:24:40
2I see.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:24:40
The base is $69. Then you need an add-on to do unlimited calls in Australia because the mobile phones aren't free. Yeah, at the moment, I haven't pushed them and jumped into any contracts.
I have kept all month-to-month, being very cautious around the cash flow and the things he wants to work around with it.
Sachee Perera | 01:24:54
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:24:59
And shouldn't be that. Okay, I pushed you guys into this plan and locked you for one year another year? No, I just modified the plans so that, in this plan, I can monitor.
It's fairly good in terms of call quality and everything. I have worked with RingCentral. It's pretty good. You might need to negotiate with them, but because we only need two or three seats, that's not even big enough for them to give us a price. Ford gave us a discount?
Sachee Perera | 01:25:24
Nineone.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:25:26
Has didn't put us into the startup plan.
The last time I spoke to them, it was $120 they were giving. Okay, let's give it $75. Well, they can't put us into a startup program because we haven't raised the fundings, so I just like hold my... I play it like, "Okay, catch."
Okay, let me then keep it into month-to-month. The problem yesterday I was looking for it. If I go up the hubs for the pro license, it is anywhere. Twelve-month commitment. So I thought I'd talk to Bonnie and say if it's a commitment, then talk to the agent. He'll get a discounted price and commit to it. He needs it.
If you want to scale, see it. If you want to scale it, you need some of the systems because otherwise you'll just get lost in the data and not make good insights. That's where I am at for me now. It's 20 to 20 accounts. Imagine, in a month's time I'll have 100 accounts there when I start.
If I'm starting my day as an iconic ex-hier, I need to see where I'm going, who I'm focusing. Right, that's the thing.
Sachee Perera | 01:26:27
Awesome, man. This is very helpful. Thank you so much for today. It's good to chat with you and hear from all the good work you've done and the key insights you're getting.
I think this is a good time to be in the business as well.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:26:40
Two absolutely.
Sachee Perera | 01:26:42
It's the most exciting time, which is great.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:26:46
Yeah.
Sachee Perera | 01:26:47
Cool, I might leave you and skedadd and maybe I'll hit you up, you know, Thursday shit, it's Wednesday today. I might head you Thursday or Friday or something. Do you work every day? Or. Y.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:27:00
I I work in Australian times and then I just take a day off. In the morning I start, I just coordinate with Kaw, and if she needs a singer with her, then sometimes I catch up with her when she has situations where she works with sometimes. Today was a long call. We had a client yesterday, and I had to show her a bit more.
So that's how we go. Then again, you had to go through the construction industry. I had to do the same with her. So, I spent over time talking about this, "This is how it is, this is how that is." Today, she had a customer, and she was talking about integrations, and then I had to explain what integrations are to her. She didn't...
It's natural she doesn't know. It's my duty as a senior seller to understand her and how it works. Then I told her what APS is, why integrations are important, and how it can be a win for us as customers. He said, "I am very much in the dark."
I can't even imagine bringing it over here.
Sachee Perera | 01:27:55
Yeah.
Sandy Balakrishnan | 01:27:55
So you need to know what integration is, how you can bring it over, what we can do in Australia, how partners handle integrations. How can we make that process easy for us?
It's called VND larger. It's a bit of coding and those kinds of things are there because, as a young seller, I have discovered this on the way, and people are showing me. So, that's how it goes.
I have a set SA with her. She sends me an evening daily report.
