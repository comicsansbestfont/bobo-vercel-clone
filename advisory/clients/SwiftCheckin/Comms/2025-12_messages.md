**Subject:** TAM Slide Update - Quick Framework

Hey Boney,

Great chat today. Wanted to follow up on the TAM slide discussion with a clearer framework for you.

**The key shift:** Investors don't actually care about the TAM/SAM/SOM numbers themselves—they care that you understand your market opportunity customer-by-customer. Big inflated numbers make them tune out. Bottoms-up math makes them lean in.

**Here's how to restructure the slide:**

Instead of the typical three-bubble TAM/SAM/SOM approach, show this:

**1. Your beachhead segment (SOM)**
- Who: Electrical subcontractors with 5-20 employees in metro Australia
- How many: ~3,000 businesses
- ACV potential: $500-1,000/month
- **Bottoms-up calc:** 3,000 × $6,000/year = **$18M addressable now**

**2. Your expansion segment (SAM)**
- Who: All trade contractors (electrical, plumbing, HVAC, roofing) with similar profile
- How many: ~15,000 businesses in Australia
- **Bottoms-up calc:** 15,000 × $8,000/year (more modules) = **$120M serviceable market**

**3. Full opportunity (TAM)**
- Who: Trade contractors across ANZ + eventually UK/US
- How many: ~100,000+ businesses
- **Bottoms-up calc:** 100,000 × $12,000/year (full platform) = **$1.2B total market**

**The logic investors want to see:**
- "In Australia, there are X trade contractors in our target segment"
- "Our product solves Y problem, which we can charge $Z for"
- "X × $Z = our market opportunity"
- "We're starting with electrical contractors because [Ariel's use case proves the pain]"

**What to avoid:**
- Top-down numbers from Gartner/IBISWorld without your own logic
- Inflated global TAM that has nothing to do with your current focus
- The generic "if we get just 1% of this $10B market..." pitch

Once you've updated the slide, send me the PDF and I'll circulate it again.

Talk soon,
Sachee
