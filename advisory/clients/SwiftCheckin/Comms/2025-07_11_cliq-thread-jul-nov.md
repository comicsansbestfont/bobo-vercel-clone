**Boney Mylady:** Hello [Tag: @Sacheverel], I've shared a document with you in Zoho WorkDrive. [Link: GameHandover-14July]
**Boney Mylady:** [Link: https://workdrive.zohoexternal.com/...]
**Boney Mylady:** Hi Sachev - pls see this excel sheet. It contains all the software access and details. Please feel free to add any missing details to this sheet.
**You:** Thanks Boney. Good morning. I've logged into the Vault but I do not see the Hubspot login or dialpad at the moment. [Screenshot of Vault]
**Boney Mylady:** Let me check. I tried to provide the access again. Can you pls try again? From my side, it says all the passwords have been shared. Let me know otherwise.
**You:** Good morning, Boney. Thanks for sharing the vault, but I'm unable to access Hubspot and the marketing email for Google because of 2FA. Can you pls try to add me as a user on the following: - hubspot - google analytics - google search console. The user name and password for apollo doesnt seem to work.

**Boney Mylady:** Sure will do. [Link: HubSpot is marketing, sales, and service software that helps businesses grow]. Added you to hubspot.
**You:** great thank you.
**Boney Mylady:** Added to google search console. In google sc, analytics. I've updated handover excel sheet. Pls check that for further details.
**You:** Thanks Boney. I think the only blocker for me at the moment is the call recordings which is on one drive for me to get stuck in. Once I get that I will spend the next couple of days reviewing content and then start engaging the team.
**Boney Mylady:** Cool, sounds like a plan. Will try to unblock you today itself.
**You:** No stress, if I have other systems access, but I don't need that as priority to start. I've updated the Handover document.
**Boney Mylady:** No probs, will check and keep adding you to the required access...

**Thursday, July 17**
**Boney Mylady:** [Reply to above] Hey Sachev - do you wish to attend the timesheet product demo meeting?
**Boney Mylady:** For the meeting - let us to it tomorrow 12 - 1 PM AEST if that suits you?
**You:** Hi Boney. I think if you can record that product demo and send it, I'll be able to review that and go from there. Tomorrow 12-1 works well.
**Boney Mylady:** 12-1 PM is yours. Pls let me know the details I should come prepared with for tomorrow's meeting.
**You:** Yep, I'll send you a message later today after my calls with Nisha and Jayadev.
**Boney Mylady:** cooliooo
**You:** Hi Boney here a rough agenda and I have some questions prepared around the following topics I'd like to extract from you.
**Product Vision & Roadmap** - Understanding priorities, feature requests, and your long-term vision.
**Sales** - Sales processes, and diving deep into the current 2 sales in trial.
**Value Proposition & Positioning** - Clarifying the core message and differentiation.
**Competitive Landscape** - Your perspective on key competitors and unique advantages.
**Business Strategy** - Extracting your view on overall strategy.
**Boney Mylady:** great sound good. talk to you tomorrow.

**Friday, July 18**
**Boney Mylady:** Good morning! [Sun emoji]
**You:** [Screenshot of video meeting] Hi Boney, I am getting this message when I try to join the teams.
**Boney Mylady:** Let me try again! Weird. Microsoft Teams Meeting ID: 416 663 222 274 8 Passcode: xLHX79
**Boney Mylady:** can you click on this link pls?

**Tuesday, July 22**
**Boney Mylady:** Good afternoon Sachev! Hope all is well! Just checking did you get everything required to complete your report? Pls let me know if anything is blocking you from finishing the report.

**Wednesday, July 23**
**You:** Hi Boney, hope you're well. Yes, I have everything. I have already identified everything, and I have the recommendations. I'll hopefully have something to present to you by the end of this week.
**Boney Mylady:** Great, looking forward to it. [Image blurred]

**Thursday, July 24**
**You:** Hi Boney, are you and Nisha available tomorrow after noon Sydney time? After the daily stand-up, maybe around 2-3:30? I have the findings to go through, and we'll do a micro-workshop tomorrow. At the same time, I think maybe an hour or hour and a half might be required for this one. Sorry, I actually just realized there is a demo at 3.30 tomorrow. I'm happy to do after the demo sometime at 4:30, perhaps Sydney time. Or I can try to be here before 1 pm as well.
**Boney Mylady:** Thanks Sachev, let us do it at 4.30 Sydney time. Can we (you and Sandy) jump into a quick call?
**You:** Yes. Just about to call you.
**Boney Mylady:** First time we have reached 5k website visitors in 23 days. Well done DM team! [Clapping/Rocket emoji]. [Graph image].
**You:** Just FYI.
**Boney Mylady:** Regarding the call between us - do it tomorrow or today? I'm talking about - you mentioned that after call with Sandy, we will have a separate call.
**You:** My only feedback was around the customer discovery aspect which I identified as a pattern in questioning etc. We'll cover this tomorrow unless you wanted to just talk about it now. The good news is we are in a good position right now, and there are only a couple of small tweaks that we need to do.
**Boney Mylady:** That's alright then. Let us talk about it tomorrow in detail.
**You:** sounds good.
**Boney Mylady:** [Replying to: "The good news is we are in a good position..."] Glad to hear that Sachev! Much appreciated for your time and efforts! Thank you!

**Sunday, August 3**
**You:** Hi Boney, Did you manage to have success with calling Andrew the other day?
**Boney Mylady:** Sorry no Sachev! I did some other important things on last day in the office.
**You:** No worries!
**Boney Mylady:** I've scheduled an email to be delivered first thing on Monday morning and will call after. I will keep you posted.
**You:** sounds good.

**Monday, August 4**
**Boney Mylady:** Spoke to Andrew - he is again too busy and requesting to hold it for a month! I tried telling him that there is that there is no need for him to spend time on trial. However, he keeps telling he's too busy with new projects. So how do you want to book the Melbourne flights?
**You:** That's cool, I'll confirm flights etc with you tomorrow.
**Boney Mylady:** ok. When should we share 90 days plan with Sandy and Jayadev? And when we start the paid ads? Re: calls - continuing as is.

**Tuesday, August 5**
**Boney Mylady:** Good morning Sachev! When should we share 90 days plan with Sandy and Jayadev? Thought to give you a quick follow up.
**You:** Good morning, Boney. Sorry, I did not see your messages.
**Boney Mylady:** That's ok. I'm on my way back, in transit now.
**You:** We can do Friday or Monday, whichever works best for you.
**Boney Mylady:** We can do Friday. How are we going to do it? Share part of your report to them and explain the action plan?
**You:** I'll whip up some slides together, and then we can go through that via a presentation. I'm just trying to sort out a couple of things and deciding do I fly in on Thursday or Friday.
**Boney Mylady:** Ok ok.
**You:** Do you have a recommendation or a preference?
**Boney Mylady:** What would be best for you to meet on Friday?
**You:** Nothing. Just a clear presentation that make sense to all. I spoke to Sandy/Javadey we are going with the three pillars framework. And told them - will come up with an action plan this week.
**Boney Mylady:** Great. That's fantastic.
**Boney Mylady:** Let me know once you book the flights and will confirm the team according to your schedule and our in-person meeting as well.
**You:** I'll be arriving in Melbourne on Thursday morning. And leaving Saturday afternoon. We can do team meeting friday. Can do our in person in the morning or afternoon on Thursday. Let me know what works for you.
**Boney Mylady:** Let us do Thursday afternoon.
**You:** Landed in Melbourne. I'll confirm tomorrow morning. I'll be arriving in Melbourne on Thursday morning. And leaving Saturday. Welcome to Melbourne. I'll confirm with the team.

**Wednesday, August 6**
**Boney Mylady:** Good morning Sachev! We will catch up Thursday afternoon. Our check-in time is tomorrow 2:00 PM. We will catch up after that. Where are you staying? I can come and pick u up. Let me know your thoughts.
**You:** I'm just staying in the city on Collins Street.
**Boney Mylady:** Ok no probs. Or meet in city then.
**You:** Cool. Are we going to book an office for WeWork. Unless if you have another preference or access to a different option.
**Boney Mylady:** Sure, you can book an office for wework. I can in the morning and spend the whole day there. Do the demo from there as well. I usually WFH or library during my stay in Melbourne.
**You:** If you forward that option, I'll pay for it. It is a shame to make you pay for it while you're in Melbourne.
**Boney Mylady:** No thats all good.
**You:** [Map image] Its 152 elizabeth street wework.
**Boney Mylady:** Sounds good. Let us catch up there. Meet tomorrow around 10 am there as well.
**You:** I land at 9:20 so I should be there by potentially 10 am. I think you should be able to access the office space before I get there. But let me confirm as I'm trying to get them on the phone to authorise you.
**Boney Mylady:** Cool.
**You:** They said if you just go to reception tomorrow when you get there, they will take you to the office. The space opens at 9am.
**Boney Mylady:** cool, thanks heaps for that Sachev!

**Thursday, August 7**
**Boney Mylady:** Good morning Sachev! I'm on level 9, wework. have you landed in Melbourne?
**You:** Yes. Just landed. I'm just on my way there now!
**Boney Mylady:** Great, see you soon then!
**Boney Mylady:** [Link: "Didn't we invest in building drilling cost and production reporting? | Sachev Perera posted..." on LinkedIn] Hey Sachev - It was nice talking to you. Really appreciate spending time with me today! Nice discussion around many subjects. I know it was a long day for you. Have a good rest! Talk to you tomorrow.

**Friday, August 8**
**Boney Mylady:** Morning Boney, good to see you yesterday too. How did you go with the review for the team presentation? I'm just looking for a spot to sit down and happy to jump on a call to go through with you. We can discuss the items around SIs and the current group separately once you have more time to digest.
**Boney Mylady:** Morning Sachev! Yes, reviewed the team presentation - it looks good! It looks like I'm taking too much time on Vision, mission statement/ Apart from that all good. Good to see - Siacs and Current Group. I'm thinking to push it to next week.
**Boney Mylady:** I had a meeting with Autodesk - 8:00 am today.
**Boney Mylady:** Would you like to catch up at 2 o'clock to go through the team slides. Or I can hop on now?
**You:** Let us do it at 2.
**Boney Mylady:** Sounds good.
**You:** Hello [Tag: Boney Mylady], I've shared a folder with you in Zoho WorkDrive. [Link: Swift CheckIn]
**Boney Mylady:** thanks Sachev! going through that now.
**You:** I have created a folder where I've dropped the Zoho version of the slides, and I have also created a doc for the strategic positioning work. The strategic positioning work includes both the larger company level and the lens we have to take the next 90 days from an outreach perspective.

### Part 2: Operations, MJ Constructions, and Process Updates (Pages 3–6)

**Monday, August 11**
**Boney Mylady:** [Link: Microsoft Teams Meeting] for our 2 pm meeting.
**You:** Simple and easy!
**Boney Mylady:** I went well, overall they had more questions, which I think they are getting/ messaging clarified. I'll share the recording soon. If you have any suggestions about the presentation or anything I've missed pls let me know. Thanks Sachev! [Link: Sales & Marketing 101 Dec | Meeting | Microsoft Teams]
**Boney Mylady:** Your app login details. [Image blurred]
**You:** Good morning Boney. Great, I'll see you there, and we can walk to a breakfast place.
**Boney Mylady:** Morning Sachev! Sounds great. It seems I would be there by 9:30. Pls send the location you're staying.
**You:** Hi Boney, I'm at 480 Collins Street. Im going to check out in a bit just packing up and things.
**Boney Mylady:** No stress. Take your time pls.

**Sunday, August 10**
**You:** It was good spending time with you yesterday. I have spent majority of today putting together all the different bits and pieces, but I didn't get to finish it. And right now my brain is a bit fried haha. I'll try and get something to you tomorrow, having the meeting with the team, so that debrief with them will be good. One of the things I didn't get to bring up over the last couple of days is I would like to review our engagement considering that there's a lot of foundational work that's been done here that will hopefully bring success to you. Balancing the scales between fees vs. equity/options would be something I'd want us to do, but I'm happy to leave this for later after we get past this initial launch phase of the sprint. Have a good night!
**Boney Mylady:** Hey Sachev - I too spend some good time today reviewing the discussions we had and documenting meeting action plans. my brain is a bit fried as well - so I can relate. Sure Sachev! As I mentioned during our meeting, I'd like everyone engaged with us to succeed in the best way possible. As the company grows, everyone should grow and flourish, that's what we truly wish! Let us have that discussion later - past the initial phase of the sprint as you mentioned.

**Monday, August 11**
**You:** Thank you. Have a good night, too. We'll chat tomorrow.
**Boney Mylady:** [Link: Sales & Marketing 101 Dec | Meeting | Microsoft Teams] Can you pls download this and send this to me via Zoho Drive? Because it's asking me for a Teams account (and dont need one!)
**You:** Sure, will do tomorrow.
**Boney Mylady:** Hello [Tag: Sachev], I've shared a document with you in Zoho WorkDrive. [Link: Sales & Marketing Recording.mp4]
**Boney Mylady:** Please find the above meeting recording. For tomorrow's meeting, are we ready with what we need to provide to the team today? I'd like both of us to have a quick meeting before the team meeting.
**You:** Hello [Tag: Boney Mylady], I've shared a document with you in Zoho WorkDrive. [Link: Detailed Action Plan]
**You:** Hi Boney, I won't be able to catch up with you prior to the team meeting today, but here is the detailed action plan that I've put into some spreadsheets with phases and actions. There is more documentation that I have compiled which I won't have time to clean up for this meeting. In the meeting, let's just do a quick debrief on everyone's reflections, and we can figure out how to communicate the next steps. There is a lot of work to do, so we'll need to delegate as much as possible.
**Boney Mylady:** yep. I was about to ask you the same thing - how to delegate it effectively. Have you added strategic positioning document to this?
**You:** The one thing that you can circulate after today's meeting is the strategic positioning document.
**Boney Mylady:** sure, will do.
**You:** Hello [Tag: Boney Mylady], I've shared a document with you in Zoho WorkDrive. [Link: Overtime Questions.pdf]
**Boney Mylady:** Lot of things to digest on that excel sheet. Gone through it quickly, sounds like a plan! Good one Sachev!
**You:** FYI - Document prepared by Sandy - related to Overtime discovery questions and quantifying the pain. This task was given to identify how much Sandy understood from the presentation we delivered on Friday. Thought to share as this will give you an understanding of delegation level - (clear canvas vs outline painter example we discussed on Uber).
**Boney Mylady:** That is fantastic and a good start.
**You:** Hey Sachev - can you pls share the strategic positioning document to Jayadev and Sandy? I can't do it as you're the document owner. Also, one thing I keep forgetting to ask you is - How did you go with the hubspot meeting on Friday (Heidelberg)? Any luck there?
**You:** Hi Boney, sorry about the access. I've given you organized access in Zoho, so you should be able to share them with everyone. I've added the following documents: Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Deep Dive: "The Overtime & Overrun" Contractor. [Link provided]. This contains a deep dive on the ICP, as well as the use case and the problems etc. It is a shared document between sales, marketing, and product. It's an extension of the strategic positioning document.
**Boney Mylady:** Multi-Channel Outreach - [Link provided]. This document has everything to do with the multi-channel outreach, which is how to build the sequence, how to make phone calls, and how to send emails.
**Boney Mylady:** Great, thank you so much Sachev! This is awesome!
**You:** I am yet to put together documentation on the SPICED framework and the discovery questioning based on the SPICED flow. And then quite important, an objection handling document (I might leave that one out). Once you've reviewed this, let's go through all of it together tomorrow or the day after. FYI - I meant to say the objection handling document which I might do a little bit later as I an need to flesh that one out and make it really easy for them to use.

**Tuesday, August 12**
**Boney Mylady:** For Kavita/meetings it could get invites sent to: howdy@sachev.com.au. Is that alright?
**You:** sure noted. RE: Hubspot - I caught up with him on Friday, and he said he's going to talk to a bunch of people. I nudged him earlier today as well. No response. I'll try calling him tomorrow.

**Wednesday, August 13**
**You:** Excellent thats fantastic news Boney!
**Boney Mylady:** Is it working in firefox? Or which browser?
**You:** Thanks Sachev! Indeed congrats to you as well! This is the first done after our spearhead approach! Would highly recommend video recording sometime today. Hey Sachev, I wanted to ask about setting up the free trial for Damian. MrShingles. When you get a chance, can you pls reply or have a 15 mins meeting to help us make that process streamlined?

**Thursday, August 14**
**Boney Mylady:** Hey, that they have to of people to hire from, but they're going to ask for a placement fee. I'll think, Let's wait till we land the first couple of deals and drive some momentum before we pull the trigger on this.
**You:** Cool. sounds like a plan!
**Boney Mylady:** nothing is cheaper these days other than founders time! Hey Sachev just for an update - we are very clear with execution now. Put together the plan to execute both high touch and tech touch simultaneously. Spoke with Sandy about the distraction - reckons, he don't require more than 1 hour/day for Kavitha so he won't be distracted from the primary activity. Will finish this catch up tomorrow to go through where we are upto and you can suggest any modifications required. If you're available.
**You:** Glad to hear about the execution. Hopefully Sandy doesn't get distracted, but that's okay if he thinks he does. I have a packed day tomorrow and I'm only free after about 4pm. Or I can do around 1pm today if you are free.
**Boney Mylady:** Ok let us do at 1 PM then.
**You:** Ok sounds good.

**Friday, August 15**
**Boney Mylady:** Hello [Tag: Sachev], I've shared a document with you in Zoho WorkDrive. [Link: ProcessFlowv2.xls]
**Boney Mylady:** Good afternoon Sachev! Modified the process steps. Pls review when you get a chance. Second page is to understand the calculations.
**You:** Hi Boney. you can certainly send that through. Just make sure the "tech touch" is "Low Touch Outcomes" from a payoff that matters.
**Boney Mylady:** sure, will make that change and send it across.
**You:** Hi Boney. I spoke with some accounting firms and learned a little bit more about the R&D rebate and your eligibility. Just as a standard, the R&D rebate can be applied to anything related to creating an innovative business. We did this at comPlan, and based on what we are doing at SWIFT, you're most definitely eligible for it. This means you can claim rebates of expenses into things like hosting, office rent, and expenses such as labour. Unfortunately, the spend has to be made within Australia for Australian services/entities. I think the firm might be a ability to recoup some costs from the last 12 months or so if it's anything substantial. I'm thinking software expenses, hosting expenses, and any contractors that you may have hired within Australia. The firms charge anywhere between $8k to $12k, and we will need to do some backup of the envelope numbers to see if it's even worthwhile doing that now.
**Boney Mylady:** Sounds good that Sachev! Let me work it out on an excel sheet to find out the numbers.
**You:** The majority of our expenses are - to pay to employees in India. Back of the envelope numbers. Sorry, I'm using voice-to-text. Okay maybe it's worthwhile keeping this in mind for future for us to be successful and scale we definitely need an Australian team.
**Boney Mylady:** We do need an Australian team. for sure. In terms of the engineering team back in India, maybe we can think a little bit creatively how to structure the payments, maybe via an agency of some sort.
**You:** I was thinking same - creating and paying an agency here and then from there pay to India. If we paid to contractors/staffs, salary and superannuation here in Australia would have worked as well... Anyway, I was coding along with them those days! Last 1 year, we have spend $150k min - if we would have got 44% of rebate - that itself would have been another $66k which would be a huge help for us.
**Boney Mylady:** Hello [Tag: Sachev], I've shared a document with you in Zoho WorkDrive. [Link: Tech Touch.xls]
**Boney Mylady:** We dont need to send both one pager and this above doc (as email body)?
**You:** You only need one or the other. If you're sending that email body, you probably don't need to attach the one-pager because it's too much. They both convey the similar information. For this one, I think the email is more than sufficient, and you don't not need to send the one pager. You can save it for later, should we need to re-engage in another way. There is a way to use the one-pager that I can go through with you next week.

**Monday, August 18**
**Boney Mylady:** Hope you had a good weekend! Just a quick update, I'm going through the notion workspace you've shared - SPICED.
**You:** Not a bad weekend. How about yours? Great that you're reading through the Spiced framework - it's more context and to solidify your understanding. And then hopefully we can get the entire team across the same model.
**Boney Mylady:** Re SPICED - I've shared that internally. Team will work on it to develop a better version of it as we progress. Overall it makes sense to me. I hope it will be for everyone. Re: notion - checking - let me come back to you after reading it. Hey Sachev - those reports mentioned (daily and weekly), if we do everything from hubspot, you reckon Sandy can export it directly from there? Also - when can we catch? How about this evening - 2:30 - 3:30 PM? I've added you as an optional attendee. Please feel free to join.
**You:** Yes. Re: Reports, Hubspot Sales Pro can create specific reports but they won't be as flexible as Excel. The detailed mmjps resource setup will slow down if they haven't set this up before - recommend manual for now till end of the 90 days then we can build a better engine based on learnings. And this is us doing week 2 planning/review: 2:30 - 3:30 PM.
**Boney Mylady:** alright make sense. Let me have a discussion with Sandy, we will work it out. see you then.
**Boney Mylady:** [Zoom Meeting link]. Passcode: WWG8Gm
**You:** Hi boney i'm in the waiting room.
**Boney Mylady:** Hello [Tag: Sachev], I've shared a document with you in Zoho WorkDrive. [Link: Damian ProfileB]
**Boney Mylady:** Hi Boney. I've put together the basic framework for HubSpot. Please review and see if that makes sense; I've left a comment in there for you. The AI workspace that works for you | Notion.

**Tuesday, August 19**
**Boney Mylady:** Good morning Sachev! Two questions from Marketing (Jayadev) are: 1. Home page - whether it should be "Construction industry" OR "For all contractors(electricians, plumbers, HVAC, plasterers etc) across multiple industries (Construction, Mining, solar, heavy industries)"? 2. What will be the next step after collecting the membership(NECA)? - Are we joining these associations as a member?
**You:** 1) For now, we should say "Contractors in the Construction Industry". So electricians, plumbers, HVAC, and be specific that it's for contractors that do construction projects. 2) For the associations, try and identify which ones are going to be the most friendly to us, and which association has the biggest network of contractors. Most of these associations have their own conferences, trade shows, sundowners, and events. Getting a list of those is paramount. We can start off by going to a couple of events before deciding whether we become a member or not. Unless of course the membership is super cheap. 3) yeah, just remove the pricing and say "Contact Sales for a tailored quote." Or request a quote.
**Boney Mylady:** great, thanks for the answers. We can organize a catch up for further deep dive if needed. I have a number of other engagements today afternoon.
**You:** 2 years is a long time! For only 25% off? Re: cost of the content starter and service starter. Bit of a stalemate. What is the cost of just the 2 sales hub professional + 1 core license? Might work out cheaper without locking in and give us time to work on getting startup discounts.
**Boney Mylady:** Yes - I've requested for 1x stk + 2xcore license. Let us see what they come up with.
**You:** If Kavitha is doing outbound she might need it too? I think Kavitha needed only sales starter to enter the details. Depends on activities Kavitha needed to do on hubspot. You reckon we need to check with hubspot sales guy?

**Wednesday, August 20**
**Boney Mylady:** Good morning Sachev! FYI - we are trial onboarding Damian today, 1 PM.
**You:** Good morning, Boney. I think Kavitha may need access to Professional if she needs to use sequences for the "Tech Touch". Alternatively, those same emails can be built as marketing emails that Jayadev can replicate within Hubspot like he did with emails. If so she doesn't use sequences, Jayadev and Kavita would need to coordinate on which accounts received what emails and when so she can time her calls accordingly. This is all depending on whether the core license gives her access to the sequences or not based on the negotiation with Hubspot.
**Boney Mylady:** This is fantastic news. Please let me know how you go or if you want to do some pre prep with me. I can carve out about half an hour today at some point before 1pm.
**You:** I think we can fly through that - we are going to be today. What 30 min window suits you? How about 11:00 - 11:30?
**Boney Mylady:** Let's aim for that. Thanks much for your time today. Link to the timesheet/onboarding landing page contents and emails (for tech touch): [Link].
**Boney Mylady:** Hey Sachev - Just wanted to pass happy news [Sun emoji]. we was able to complete registration and checkin less than 1 min in his own mobile. And was super happy to add all his team members can join tomorrow itself! The overall onboarding took only 20 mins. (vs user everything we had discussed this morning).
**You:** Hi boney that is such good news! Congrats on the successful start on this one. Did you organise the next meeting for next week?
**Boney Mylady:** Yes, next Thursday. 2pm. That's his next payroll day.

**Thursday, August 21**
**Boney Mylady:** Landing page design - [Link: Timesheet Management - Swift CheckIn].
**Boney Mylady:** Hey Sachev - our meeting notes here: 1. Re: Hubspot - No need to spend daily time on Sales & Marketing activities. Don't do the bi-weekly marketing meeting - SEO, linkedin metrics etc. Stop doing SEO. Do it only when you think it is required. Rather do sales/marketing metrics by Sachev. (2 times weekly, with a 1 day SLA). 2. Sachev will do Bi-weekly Audit on Sales and marketing activities to understand what we can stop or continue. 3. Study of Events/Attending events in next 30 days. - MBA vs. others. - Sachev will introduce us to a startup lawyer. - Board of events people and associations to attend those events. - Boney to block time on a day on the departments. - Sachev will update the list on marketing activities by Friday, 22 Aug. - ROI - Boney sit with the Accountant and find out amount we are spending on each item and then next meeting will discuss further. (38.5 - 52K is they charging). Let me know if I missed anything.
**You:** Looks good! With the introduction to the lawyer, let's introduce him once we have some key questions, etc otters. After you have met with the referral from Jason (Advin's Lawyer). This way we can be specific about what questions we have to ask and make better use of any free introductory timeslots.

**Friday, August 22**
**Boney Mylady:** Hello [Tag: Sachev], I've shared a document with you in Zoho WorkDrive. [Link: Damian profile.docx]
**Boney Mylady:** Good morning Sachev! Congratulations - 2 out of 3 site users started adding timesheets from this morning. What a great way to start! [Party popper]

**Monday, August 25**
**You:** Hi Boney, I've put together a Notion weekly sync space for us, and you can see the agenda for today's discussion that we will go through. [Link: The AI workspace that works for you | Notion].
**Boney Mylady:** Sure. got it. Thanks Sachev! when you get a chance, can you pls review this and add comments? 1. Landing page - submitted for verification), everything else has been added on this document. 2. Updated ICP document about Profile B, which will be ready by midday.
**You:** Hi Boney, I will view that and make some comments. Are we able to meet at 11am Hertz time in about an hour instead of our scheduled time that we had. Apologies if it's inconvenient. Please let me know.

**Wednesday, August 27**
**Boney Mylady:** Good morning Sachev! Just wanted to update the safari login issue yesterday. Bought a mac device in our office yesterday, tested, confirmed and informed the client! Damian's all site users onboarded. They did all now 2 timesheets so far. And Tech touch starts started today. Sequencing and all other settings completed in hubspot. Need a quick suggestion here: 1) Linkedin Business for searching and prospecting clients) - $40 per month. (Kavitha) 2) Lusha - contact enrichment - $100 per month (Both for Sandy and Kavitha). Is that really required?
**You:** 1) LinkedIn business yes that is necessary. 2) Better platform is cheaper and focused on australian market called Firminfo, which I would highly recommend over Lusha. Please get one of them to sign up using the web link and the trial. I will reach out to them to get a further discount.

### Part 3: MJ Constructions, Pivot, and Board Meeting (Pages 5–9)

**Monday, September 1**
**Boney Mylady:** Hey Sachev! Just a gentle nudge towards the end of our meeting. So just to clarify one point I said: Regarding the runway/burn rate - that's when I was talking about two options (I didn't mention the second option during the conversation at all!) 1. If we are not approaching VCs, angels soon - running lean and rely on organic, facebook (is bring more 1-10 companies) to get Swift Checkin up and running by itself. (break even) 2. If we are approaching VCs, angels - we have to start pitching the investors as typically it will take 3-6 months to get the investment closed. (especially as x mas is approaching). Depending on the direction regarding to funding decision, we can have that multiple possibility discussions in next week's meeting!
**You:** Okay, so let's look at factoring that piece out this week. We need to get a better understanding of the boundary and what we are willing to sacrifice if we think we can get to breakeven. As I said earlier, I am happy to put in some cash on myself to help us cross the bridge. Otherwise, yes, we will need to start looking for VCs now. Which is why I kinda want to see how the team goes this week before we make any of those decisions. Let's allocate the entirety of Monday to talk through this in detail. So maybe 15 minutes on just the business as usual stuff and then the capital raising.
**Boney Mylady:** yes. agree. let us do that on Monday! [Link: Overtime in Construction - Learn how overtime with real-time labour cost control].
**Boney Mylady:** Video I was talking about today - side-users how to check in.
**You:** Hi Boney here is the video walkthrough. [Link provided].

**Tuesday, September 2**
**Boney Mylady:** Hello [Tag: Sachev], I've shared a document with you in Zoho WorkDrive. [Link: Sales & Marketing 101 Deck]
**Boney Mylady:** Created a 101 marketing doc, I've created the above [pointer] deck! We will discuss tomorrow based on this deck.

**Wednesday, September 3**
**Boney Mylady:** Damian just rang me. He can't make it tomorrow 11 AM. He requested to push it to the arvo. Can't tell us exactly what time the reaches the office (as he's driving site to site), but will be sometime between 1 PM - 4 PM. Said he's confident to do it next Monday if not tomorrow. I'll cancel tomorrow's VC meeting tomorrow wait to make myself available. Damian's doing well - all guys checking in/out - all good with timesheets. Eager to see his last week suggestions in action.

**Thursday, September 4**
**Boney Mylady:** [Link: Microsoft Teams Meeting] Join the meeting now. MJ Constructions.
**Boney Mylady:** Hey mate - Thank you from the bottom of my heart of being with me and team in taking us through this process! Much appreciated. I owe you next drink.
**You:** No dramas at all. Good to see this all coming together. Its not over till we get the deal signed! But yes very encouraging!

**Monday, September 8**
**Boney Mylady:** Good morning Boney. Hope you had a nice weekend? Are you able to put the discussion points for a weekly sync into the Notion document for catchup? [Link provided].
**Boney Mylady:** We got an inbound lead just now. Usually, we send a quick email asking for a discovery call. Should we follow the same process in this case?
**You:** "Hey, thank you for putting an enquiry in through. We are excited to see how we can help! What are you hoping that Swift Check-In can solve for you? And you start the discovery process right there, right then.
**Boney Mylady:** MJ Constructions left a voice message, didn't pick up the call. going to send a quick email. Meeting booked for Thursday 2 PM. timesheets and scheduling they are looking for.
**Boney Mylady:** Hi boney I think our catchup is in 30 minutes no?
**You:** oh yea my bad. I'm in.
**Boney Mylady:** Nisha said she is joining - so she will come in as well.
**You:** Hi Boney. Just putting this together to back of the envelope quick cash flow based on annual deals coming through vs. monthly deals. I've adjusted this for seasonality and with assumptions around $2,000 for up-front subscriptions and $200 for monthly subscriptions. Expenses or outflow is static, but I think for us to achieve that 29 deals per month, those numbers need to go up in terms of expenses. Flipping from staff based in India to staff based in Australia the outflow will change as well. [Link: Google Sheets: Sign-in].
**Boney Mylady:** Thanks Sachev! The spreadsheet is very high-level I have been factored into payment waterfalls, etc). We can develop more into it as we go from a more detailed sales plan to expenses around BAU and staff etc.

**Wednesday, September 10**
**Boney Mylady:** Kavitha booked another demo - next Monday. Home - Power Control Engineers.
**You:** oh yeah! From your experience - Should we go behind this? Reddit - The heart of the internet.
**Boney Mylady:** has most likely trying to sell his lead gen services or software. theres a lot of these people going around. better stay away from it?
**You:** Time is something hard.

**Thursday, September 11**
**Boney Mylady:** Re: MJ Constructions - MJ Constructions meeting has been rescheduled to Monday, 12:30 PM.
**Boney Mylady:** [Link: app.pandadoc.com]. can you pls check this? I've added you as a signer as well just wanna see how it looks for you! We will just be sending MJC proposal across to Damian. you sign it. so that we can complete the loop. I'll create another one for Damian and send it across.
**You:** Hi Boney, I would suggest taking out the support and SLAs for now, other than that, I think it looks alright. In the coming months, let's do a formal assess agreement via a lawyer once we're ready.

**Friday, September 12**
**Boney Mylady:** Hello [Tag: Sachev], I've shared a document with you in Zoho WorkDrive. [Link: DoubleAA-Afternoon-Report].
**Boney Mylady:** Hey Sachev - do we have a meeting today? at the earliest? To discuss: 1. What is the next step for Kavitha and Nisha? 2. Are we removing emails outbound from hubspot? 3. Should I talk with Harry and arrange a meeting with 3 of us?
**You:** Hi boney I'm not at home today. nisha and kavitha can start making calls but they need the sales script to follow which i am going to do over the weekend for them. Re: hubspot emails for now just pause, can you elaborate? Kavitha is should already doing this as part of the sequence. Re: Harry - that was with another agency in the past. Now he started his own, so us it will be new deals anyway I can ask him, should I?

**Monday, September 15**
**Boney Mylady:** Come up with a plan to go forward - Oct - Dec, Jan. $5M ARR. Clarify on expectations and remuneration aligned with results so that I can go back to Board confidently, answer their questions and concerns, and get this approved for a win/win solution.
**You:** Will call back in 10.
**Boney Mylady:** Morning Sachev! I've done the meeting invite for Ariel. He didn't confirm yet. Since it's raining heavily as well I'm in Play area in Sydney, things are going bit hard. He will try to fill everything by today. Not sure when can he get to the office.

**Thursday, October 23**
**Boney Mylady:** Hello [Tag: Sachev], I've shared a document with you in Zoho WorkDrive. [Link: soundingboard_proposition].
**Boney Mylady:** Following up on our conversation on the 2nd. Over the last 3 months we've built the foundations - positioning, ICP, frameworks, first customers, demo momentum. We established what you need now is execution. Someone embedded 40+ hours per week driving sales activity, managing the team, and building pipeline velocity. And based on our discussions with the board I made the decision to formally not go beyond the original engagement period. I agree with them you don't need more strategy right now, you need execution. So I've been thinking about the best way to support you without the heavy strategy price tag. I want the best for you and if you absolutely feel like you need support I can provide some light weekly support through till jan. this means One 30-minute call per week as a sounding board. This means, chatting through on fundraising, positioning, feedback on investor presentations and pitch materials and if needed feedback on hiring. What it is not is hands-on execution, training or managing your team, attending customer calls or demos, etc. This is purely a "sounding board arrangement" to help you navigate the next phase while you recruit the right full-time leader. I'll provide this through January at no charge as a bridge to your fundraise and to ensure you land the hire successfully. Purely optional and I thought I'll present it to you - otherwise if the above doesn't appeal to you. Once you've raised and are hitting your stride (likely mid-2016), I'd be open to reconnecting if advisory support makes sense.

**Friday, October 24**
**You:** Hey Sachev, Just want to read out from the above message to ensure I understood it right: 1. Sachev has agree with the board that more of Sachev's hours is not going to make any difference in Swift Checkin's revenue generation, as Sachev will not be involved in execution. both in option 2 and option 3. 2. Board wants to do a 30 min free meeting/week until Jan. 3. Sachev is least preferred or not preferring - option 3 at all moving forward at any stage. 4. Option 2 still a viable option IF Swift Checkin has raised the funding and hit the stride (mid 2016). Please correct me if any of the above pointers (my understanding) is wrong.
**You:** Hey Boney, Really appreciate you taking the time to think through this carefully – that's exactly the right approach. Let me clarify a couple of things on your summary, there we can figure out what works best for you. Re: Point 1 Just to be clear – it's not that "my hours won't make a difference." The foundations are built, we are working (Mr Shingles, Ariel, demo momentum prove that). What I'm saying is the ROLE you need to fill now is different – you need someone doing high-volume execution 40+ hrs/week, which isn't the strategic advisory model I run. It's a capability difference, not an effectiveness question. Re: Point 4 I'm not ruling out future work – just being realistic that Oct-Jan needs to be focused on execution (you driving outreach, converting pipeline, raising). Once you've raised and are scaling, we can definitely revisit what makes sense. Here is how I can help you most right now. Based on what I'm seeing, your next 3 months should probably focus on: 1) You + Nisha + Kavita driving outreach using what we built 2) Converting the current pipeline (Ariel, trials) + new demos to get momentum (even 3-4 paying customers changes your fundraising story) 3) Running a focused fundraising process The weekly 30-min call allows us to touch on these things – troubleshooting what's working, what's not, keeping you unblocked. But only if that's actually helpful for you.

**Friday, November 14**
**Boney Mylady:** Hey Sachev - FYI - got all the details from Ariel required to set up the account! [Party popper]
**You:** thats fantastic news Boney! when is the kickoff?
**Boney Mylady:** I'm planning to do it today itself. Let me see. They got 30 site users altogether (employees + subbies). I'm meeting them in person next Thursday. Wondering whether I should hold until then or do it today.
**You:** You can send the pitch deck.
**Boney Mylady:** Hey Sachev - Good morning! Sorry we have to cancel today's meeting as I've some other meeting at the sametime here in Sydney. I'll send you an update of what happened.
**You:** Good Morning! great good luck!
**Boney Mylady:** Hi boney how did you go?
**Boney Mylady:** Yes, Ariel onboarding is happening now. He provided us with a lot of information to validate our product. Within an hour - 40% of their workers are onboarded. We are waiting for rest to onboard.
**You:** great - this is the type of traction you need. how did you go with getting some more meeting with other contractors in sydney?
**Boney Mylady:** great. I forgot did you get introduced to the accountants/bookkeepers for ariel and the others.
**Boney Mylady:** I'll be having weekly meeting with her on every payroll day (same as we did for Damian).
**You:** lovely. let me know when you want to have our 30 minute catchup.
