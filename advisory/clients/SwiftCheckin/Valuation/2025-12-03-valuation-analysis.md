## Current Metrics (December 2025)

### Financial Performance

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Paying Customers** | 1 (Mr Shingles/Damian) | Client profile |
| **Trials in Progress** | 1 (Ariel) | Dec 3 meeting |
| **Pipeline** | ~10 warm leads | Dec 3 meeting |
| **Current MRR** | ~$229/month | Basic package |
| **Current ARR** | ~$2,748 | Calculated |
| **Pricing** | $229/month basic, scales with modules | Meeting transcript |
| **Team Size** | 5-6 | Client profile |

### Ariel Trial Potential (if converts)

- 20 site workers onboarded
- Using timesheets + invoicing features
- Potential ACV: $500-1,000/month based on worker count
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks to prove value, then pricing conversation

---

## Traction Status Determination (v2.2)

**Critical Question:** Does SwiftCheckin have traction?

| Indicator | Value | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| ARR | ~$2,748 | > $0 |
| Paying Customers | 1 (Mr Shingles/Damian) | > 0 |

**Determination:** SwiftCheckin HAS traction (minimal, but non-zero). Therefore:
- **Use Section B** (Market/Cultural Fit Modifier) - NOT Section E3
- Section E3 (Enhanced Market-Fit Penalty) is for ZERO-TRACTION deals only
- Per v2.2 framework: "NEVER apply both Section B and Section E3 to the same deal"

---

## Valuation Methods

### Method 1: Comparable Deals (Most Relevant)

For pre-seed ConTech/B2B SaaS in Australia with minimal revenue:

| Benchmark | Pre-Money Range |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Typical AU pre-seed | $1.5M - $4M |
| ConTech with 1 paying customer | $2M - $3M |
| Strong team, weak traction | $1.5M - $2.5M |
| Validated problem, early product | $2M - $4M |

**Comparable Valuation: $2M - $3M pre-money** (before modifiers)

---

### Method 2: Scorecard Method (Angel Valuation)

Starting from AU pre-seed median of **$3.0M** (v2.2 calibrated, record high 2024):

| Factor | Weight | Score | Adjustment |
|--------|--------|-------|------------|
| **Team** | 30% | 0.8 | -6% |
| (Technical founder, no industry background) |
| **Market Size** | 20% | 1.0 | 0% |
| (ConTech is large, validated market) |
| **Product** | 15% | 1.1 | +1.5% |
| (Working product, 2 use cases validated) |
| **Traction** | 10% | 0.7 | -3% |
| (Only 1 paying customer) |
| **Competition** | 10% | 0.9 | -1% |
| (SimPro, Fergus, Tradify established) |
| **Sales/Channels** | 10% | 0.6 | -4% |
| (GTM Readiness 27.5/100 = Chaos stage) |
| **Investor Signals** | 5% | 0.75 | -1.25% |
| (No previous funding signals) |

**Total Adjustment: -13.75%**

**Scorecard Valuation: $3.0M × 0.8625 = ~$2.59M pre-money** (before Phase 1a modifiers)

---

### Method 3: Berkus Method (Milestone-Based) - v2.2 AU Calibrated

| Element | Max Value (AUD) | SwiftCheckin Assessment | Value |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------|
| **Sound Idea** | $800K | ✅ Real problem (labor cost, invoice verification) | $650K |
| **Working Product** | $800K | ✅ Working product, 2 use cases validated | $700K |
| **Quality Founder** | $800K | ⚠️ Technical, no construction industry exp | $400K |
| **Strategic Relationships** | $800K | ⚠️ Early (Ariel, Damian, 10 warm leads) | $300K |
| **Early Revenue** | $800K | ⚠️ 1 paying customer, $2.7K ARR | $250K |
| **Sector Adjustment** | +$200K | Industrial B2B (construction) premium | $200K |

**Berkus Valuation: ~$2.5M pre-money** (before Phase 1a modifiers)

---

### Method 4: VC Method (Exit-Based)

**Assumptions:**
- Target exit in 5-7 years: $30M (modest ConTech exit)
- VC target return: 15x (pre-seed)
- Required ownership for $500K investment: $500K × 15 = $7.5M at exit
- Required ownership: $7.5M ÷ $30M = 25%

**Conservative Scenario:**
- Post-money: $500K ÷ 25% = $2M
- **Pre-money: $1.5M**

**Optimistic Scenario ($50M exit):**
- Required ownership: $7.5M ÷ $50M = 15%
- Post-money: $500K ÷ 15% = $3.3M
- **Pre-money: $2.8M**

---

## Valuation Summary (Pre-Modifier Base)

| Method | Pre-Money Valuation |
|--------|---------------------|
| Comparable Deals | $2M - $3M |
| Scorecard (v2.2 calibrated) | $2.59M |
| Berkus (v2.2 AU calibrated) | $2.5M |
| VC Method (conservative) | $1.5M |
| VC Method (optimistic) | $2.8M |

**Triangulated Base Range: $2.0M - $2.8M pre-money** (before Phase 1a modifiers)

---

## Phase 1a Valuation Modifiers (v2.2)

SwiftCheckin is Phase 1a ($0-50K ARR). The following modifiers apply:

### A. Founder-Led Sales Execution Modifier

| Assessment | Score | Modifier |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Boney has hired sales support before proving he can close deals personally | 2 | **-15%** |
| Evidence: Has team of 5-6, struggling with outbound, sales manager hired early | | |

### B. Market/Cultural Fit Modifier (Section B - Applies because has traction)

| Factor | Assessment | Modifier |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Founder from Australia | Yes | 0% (baseline) |
| Founder from construction industry | No | See Variable Penalty |
| **Variable Penalty (High-touch Enterprise)** | Construction = High-touch enterprise | **-22.5%** |

**Variable Penalty Rationale (v2.2):**
Per framework Section B.2: "High-touch enterprise (mining, construction, healthcare, govt): -20% to -25%"
- Construction involves long sales cycles
- Multiple stakeholders (site managers, owners, contractors)
- Deep domain expertise required
- Cultural trust with tradies is critical
- Applied: **-22.5%** (midpoint of -20% to -25% range)

### C. Premature Scaling Penalty

| Symptom | Present? | Penalty |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Hired sales team before founder closed 5+ deals | Yes | **-20%** |
| Has 5+ people with <$50K ARR | Yes | **-10%** |
| **Subtotal** | | -30% |
| **Capped at Maximum** | | **-50%** |

*Note: Premature Scaling Penalty capped at -50% per framework*

**Applied Penalty: -30%** (both symptoms present)

### D. Grit/Tenacity Premium

| Behavior | Present? | Premium |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Manual, high-touch founder-led sales | Partial (some cold calling) | +5% |
| Evidence of facing rejection and iterating | Yes (70% resistance) | +5% |
| Extreme capital efficiency | Partial (lean but team of 5-6) | 0% |

**Applied Premium: +10%**

### Combined Modifier Calculation

| Modifier | Value |
|----------|-------|
| A. Founder-Led Sales Execution | -15% |
| B. Market/Cultural Fit (High-touch Enterprise) | -22.5% |
| C. Premature Scaling | -30% |
| D. Grit/Tenacity Premium | +10% |
| **Total Modifier** | **-57.5%** |

**Note:** This is a severe combined penalty reflecting:
1. Tech founder selling to construction (market-fit challenge)
2. Premature hiring before founder-led sales validation
3. High organizational overhead for current ARR

---

## Triangulated Final Valuation

| Method | Base Value | Retained (42.5%) | Adjusted Value |
|--------|------------|------------------|----------------|
| Comparable Deals | $2.0M - $3.0M | x 0.425 | $0.85M - $1.28M |
| Scorecard | $2.59M | x 0.425 | $1.10M |
| Berkus | $2.5M | x 0.425 | $1.06M |
| VC Method (range) | $1.5M - $2.8M | x 0.425 | $0.64M - $1.19M |

**v2.2 Phase 1a Reality Check (Section E):**
- SwiftCheckin has 1 paying customer, so "First paying customers (1-3)" tier applies
- Per E5 table: "First paying customers (1-3)" = $600K - $1.2M
- This aligns with the modifier-adjusted range

### **v2.2 Recommended Valuation Range: $1.2M - $2.0M pre-money**

**Most Likely: ~$1.5M pre-money**

*The range is adjusted upward slightly from pure calculation to account for:*
- Working product with validated use cases
- Industrial B2B sector premium (harder to build, harder to replace)
- Evidence of learning velocity (iterating on outbound approach)

---

## Section F: Ownership Sanity Check (v2.2 NEW)

*This is a "bounding box" check comparing framework output against market expectations.*

### Likely Round Scenarios

**Scenario 1: $250K Raise (Angel-only)**

| Dilution | Implied Pre-Money |
|----------|-------------------|
| 10% | ($250K / 0.10) - $250K = **$2.25M** |
| 15% | ($250K / 0.15) - $250K = **$1.42M** |
| 20% | ($250K / 0.20) - $250K = **$1.0M** |

**Scenario 2: $400K Raise (With lead investor)**

| Dilution | Implied Pre-Money |
|----------|-------------------|
| 15% | ($400K / 0.15) - $400K = **$2.27M** |
| 20% | ($400K / 0.20) - $400K = **$1.6M** |
| 25% | ($400K / 0.25) - $400K = **$1.2M** |

### Alignment Assessment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Founder's Likely Raise** | $250K - $400K |
| **Expected Dilution Range** | 12% - 20% |
| **Implied Pre-Money (low)** | $1.0M |
| **Implied Pre-Money (mid)** | $1.5M |
| **Implied Pre-Money (high)** | $2.25M |
| **Framework Valuation Range** | $1.2M - $2.0M |
| **Alignment Status** | **Aligned** |

**Notes:**
- Framework output ($1.2M - $2.0M) overlaps with implied pre-money range ($1.0M - $2.25M)
- At a $250K raise with 15% dilution: Pre-money = $1.42M (within framework range)
- At a $400K raise with 20% dilution: Pre-money = $1.6M (within framework range)
- Sanity check PASSES - framework valuation is market-aligned

---

## Scenario Analysis (v2.2 Updated)

### Scenario A: Raise $250K now
- Pre-money: $1.5M
- Post-money: $1.75M
- Dilution: **14%**
- Boney retains: ~86% (before ESOP)

### Scenario B: Raise $400K now
- Pre-money: $1.5M
- Post-money: $1.9M
- Dilution: **21%**
- Boney retains: ~79% (before ESOP)

### Scenario C: Wait until 5 customers, then raise $400K
- Estimated pre-money with traction: $2.5M - $3.5M
- Post-money: $2.9M - $3.9M
- Dilution: **10-14%**
- Boney retains: ~87% (before ESOP)

---

## The Value of Waiting (v2.2 Updated)

**Waiting to raise is worth ~7-10% equity.**

If Boney can get to 5 paying customers ($15-20K ARR) before raising, he could:
- Raise the same $400K
- At a $2.5-3.5M pre-money instead of $1.5M
- Give up 12% instead of 21%
- Keep an extra 9% of his company

At a $30M exit, that 9% = **$2.7M** in his pocket.

**Critical Path to Better Valuation:**
1. Convert Ariel trial to paying customer
2. Close 3 more similar customers (trade contractors, 10-30 workers)
3. Founder personally leads all sales conversations (reduces premature scaling penalty)
4. Document repeatable sales process (improves GTM Readiness score)

---

## Key Valuation Drivers

### Strengths (Supporting Valuation)

1. **Working product** - Multiple use cases validated
2. **Paying customer** - Mr Shingles/Damian on 3-month contract
3. **Strong trial** - Ariel actively using with 20 workers
4. **Clear value prop** - Labor cost management, invoice verification
5. **Capital efficient** - Bootstrapped, lean team

### Risks (Discounting Valuation)

1. **Minimal traction** - Only 1 paying customer
2. **No industry connections** - Founder from outside construction
3. **Outbound struggling** - 70% resistance, SimPro entrenched
4. **Unproven repeatability** - Problem-solution fit not proven at scale
5. **Competition** - SimPro, Fergus, Tradify established players

---

## Recommendations (v2.2 Updated)

### 1. Don't Raise Yet
Focus on converting Ariel and 3-4 more customers before approaching investors. Current valuation headwinds are too strong.

### 2. Target Milestone
5 paying customers / $15-20K ARR demonstrates problem-solution fit at scale.

### 3. Reduce Valuation Penalties First
- **Founder takes back personal ownership of sales** (reduces -15% penalty)
- **Build industry relationships** (reduces -22.5% market-fit penalty)
- **Right-size the team** or hit revenue milestones (reduces -30% premature scaling penalty)

### 4. Then Raise
$250-400K at $2.5-3.5M pre-money with proven traction and reduced penalties.

### 5. Use of Funds
Marketing hire + 12-month runway to get to 15-20 customers (only after founder proves sales motion).

## Appendix A: Valuation Math Correction

**Note on ARR Multiples:**

In the Dec 3 meeting, I mentioned "10x ARR valuation" which is **not accurate** for pre-seed companies. Key corrections:

1. **10x ARR doesn't apply at pre-seed** - VCs use different methods (Berkus, Scorecard, VC Method)
2. **Pre-seed valuations are story-based** - Team, market, product quality matter more than current revenue
3. **Typical pre-seed dilution** - 15-25% for $250K-$500K, not the 80-90% I mentioned
4. **Dilution is per-round** - Compounds over multiple rounds, not in single round

---

## Appendix B: v2.2 Framework Changes Applied

| Change | Application to SwiftCheckin |
|--------|----------------------------|
| **Section B vs E3 Clarification** | Used Section B (has traction with 1 customer at $2.7K ARR), NOT Section E3 |
| **Variable Penalty by Sales Complexity** | Applied -22.5% (midpoint of -20% to -25%) for high-touch enterprise (construction) |
| **Section F: Ownership Sanity Check** | Added new section - framework valuation aligns with market expectations |
| **AI Premium Update** | N/A - SwiftCheckin is not an AI company |
| **Framework Version** | Updated to 2.2 |

### v2.2 Valuation Impact Summary

| Metric | Previous (v2.1) | Updated (v2.2) | Change |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| **Realistic Valuation** | $1.5M - $2.5M | $1.2M - $2.0M | -$0.3M to -$0.5M |
| **Most Likely** | ~$2M | ~$1.5M | -$0.5M |
| **Recommended Raise** | $250-500K | $250-400K | Tightened range |
| **Recommended Dilution** | 10-20% | 12-20% | Slight increase |

**Key Driver of Change:**
The primary valuation reduction comes from properly applying the **Variable Penalty by Sales Complexity** for construction (high-touch enterprise at -20% to -25%), which was not explicitly calculated in the previous version. This is the correct application per the v2.2 framework for a tech founder selling to construction contractors.
