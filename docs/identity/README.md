# Sachee Identity Library

**Purpose:** Source-of-truth reference for who Sachee is, how he works, and how to represent him consistently in strategy work and content.

This folder is designed for both humans and AI agents. It centralises biographical details, work history, proof points, and prompt-ready snippets so that every GTM framework, advisory asset, and piece of content is grounded in an accurate picture of Sachee.

## Files in this directory

- `SACHEE_IDENTITY_CORE_PROFILE.md`  
  Canonical profile: positioning, services, ICP/ECP, work history, philosophy, voice guidelines, and usage rules for humans/AI. High-level timeline is aligned with `04_Reference/Sachee Perera - Resume.pdf`.

- `SACHEE_IDENTITY_CONTENT_INDEX.md`  
  Index of public-facing content and proof: LinkedIn themes, Medium posts, press/podcasts, and key internal assets that define Sachee’s body of work.

- `SACHEE_IDENTITY_PROMPT_SNIPPETS.md`  
  Ready-to-use bios and prompt blocks (short/medium/long), plus a concise voice/tonality cheat-sheet for content and strategy prompts.

- `SACHEE_IDENTITY_STORY_LIBRARY.md`  
  Reusable story beats (CorePlan journey, mining → SaaS bridge, founder-led sales, AU/NZ ecosystem, etc.) with links back to source material.

## How to use this folder

- Before doing **strategy development** (GTM frameworks, diagnostics, positioning work), skim the core profile and story library to align with Sachee’s positioning and philosophy.
- Before doing **content writing** (blog posts, LinkedIn, copy), pick an appropriate bio and voice block from the prompt snippets file and include it in your prompt.
- When referencing **proof or external credibility**, consult the content index to choose real posts, articles, talks, or internal assets instead of inventing examples.

- When you need detailed employment history or dates, refer to `04_Reference/Sachee Perera - Resume.pdf` rather than expanding identity docs into a full CV.

## Maintenance guidelines

- Update the **core profile** when services, positioning, or ICP meaningfully change.
- Update the **content index** when new public content (podcasts, articles, key LinkedIn threads) is published.
- Add new stories to the **story library** when a pattern or case study keeps coming up in advisory work.
