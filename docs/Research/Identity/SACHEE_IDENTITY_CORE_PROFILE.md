# Sachee Identity: Core Profile

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for who Sachee is, who he serves, and how to represent him in strategy development and content.

This profile is opinionated but factual. It is written for:
- Humans using this workspace to build GTM frameworks and client deliverables.
- AI agents supporting strategy work, content creation, and research.

---

## 1. Snapshot

- **Name:** Sachee Perera  
- **Primary Role:** B2B SaaS go-to-market advisor and strategist.  
- **Specialisation:** Early-stage, founder-led B2B SaaS (0–10M ARR), with a focus on vertical SaaS, heavy industry, and complex B2B sales.  
- **Background:** Former COO at CorePlan (mining tech SaaS) where he built the GTM motion from first customer to scale, including SPICED framework, presales methodology, sales playbooks, and customer success processes.  
- **Geography Focus:** Australia and New Zealand (primary), with content and frameworks that generalise globally.  
- **Website:** https://www.sachee.com.au  

Use this section when you need a fast understanding of who Sachee is.

## 2. Positioning & Category

**Simple positioning line:**  
> *“I help B2B SaaS founders (especially in vertical and complex B2B markets) build practical, founder-led GTM systems that take them from $0 to $10M ARR.”*

**Category:**  
- Not a generic “growth hacker” or paid-ads consultant.  
- Not a pure “fractional CRO” who only focuses on sales.  
- Instead: an operator-turned-advisor who brings an integrated view of GTM (strategy, sales, content, pricing, CS) grounded in deep experience in under-digitised, high-ACV industries.

**Differentiation vs typical GTM consultants:**
- Operated in the trenches of vertical SaaS and mining tech, not just generic software.
- Built and documented end-to-end GTM systems (SPICED, presales, CS, content) at CorePlan.
- Emphasises **founder-led sales** as a permanent capability, not a phase to “graduate out of”.
- Obsessed with making GTM **lovable** and **stupidly obvious + highly detailed**, not abstract decks.

## 4. Ideal & Early Customer Profiles (ICP / ECP)

### 4.1 Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

Early-stage B2B SaaS and tech-enabled marketplace founders who:
- Are between pre-revenue and ~$10M ARR, with a strong focus on 0–1M ARR.  
- Operate in **vertical or complex B2B markets** (e.g. mining, heavy industry, regulated sectors).  
- Sell high-ACV products with multi-stakeholder buying groups and long sales cycles.  
- Have founder-led or founder-involved sales as the core GTM motion.  
- Want a clear, practical operating system for GTM rather than random tactics.

### 4.2 Early Customer Profile (ECP)

Founders who feel the pain most acutely **right now**:
- Running into stalled growth or “random wins” between 0–300K ARR.  
- Struggling to convert early traction into a repeatable GTM motion.  
- Overwhelmed by conflicting advice about sales, marketing, and hiring.  
- Willing to invest time and attention into structured GTM work (diagnostics, frameworks, content).

Use these definitions when designing offers, messaging, or content—especially in Phase 1a/1b GTM work.

## 6. Backstory & Origin

High-level narrative for use in content and intros. For full detail, see `04_Reference/Sachee Perera - Resume.pdf`.

- Started career in **high-volume telco sales and retention** (TSA Telco Group), progressing from part-time outbound and support roles to leading sales and retention teams for Telstra campaigns. Learned how to sell in tough conditions, coach teams, and design basic processes and dashboards.  
- Moved into **hospitality and membership turnaround** (Accor Plus), taking full P&L ownership of an underperforming programme and rebuilding sales strategy, team culture, and performance management to deliver record new sales and renewal rates across APAC.  
- Joined **UberEATS Perth** as part of the launch team, acting as “first boots on ground” for restaurant partnerships—personally selling and onboarding a large share of the initial restaurant base while shaping playbooks and metrics for expansion.  
- Led **Sidekicker’s expansion into WA** as General Manager, again as “first boots on ground”, building a dual-sided marketplace from scratch: designing local GTM, improving worker onboarding and quality, and driving strong marketplace growth and repeat usage.  
- Advised **Austal Ships** on early-stage GTM for AI/data analytics products in the ferry market, running customer discovery and early commercialisation planning.  
- At **CorePlan**, joined pre–product-market fit and helped transform a multi-product consultancy into a focused mining SaaS provider. Built the integrated GTM engine (marketing, enterprise sales, SPICED-based discovery, presales, CS, rev ops) and scaled commercial and non-technical teams while driving significant ARR and customer growth.  
- After CorePlan, shifted from full-time operator to **B2B SaaS GTM advisor**, codifying these lessons into the **GTM Strategy Workbook**, **Sachee-isms**, and a library of sales/CS playbooks and training materials. Now uses that operating system to help early-stage founders avoid random GTM tactics and build **practical, founder-led systems** that fit their context.

## 7. Core Philosophy & Sachee-isms

Sachee’s work is underpinned by a set of operating principles documented in detail in:  
`04_Reference/SACHEE_ISMS_OPERATING_PRINCIPLES.md`

The 13 core principles include:
- **“Speed is our weapon”** – move faster than incumbents.  
- **“Always solve for the customer”** – customer outcomes drive retention and referrals.  
- **“Meet the customer where they’re at”** – don’t assume buyers are tech-native or self-serve.  
- **“When they zig, we zag”** – contrarian, focused positioning beats chasing consensus.  
- **“Save the cheerleader, save the world”** – win a tight beachhead segment to unlock the broader market.  
- **“Stupidly obvious + highly detailed”** – be both simple and deeply specific.  
- **“Do things that don’t scale”** – especially for the first 10–30 customers.  
- **“People buy from people, not logos”** – founder-led content and presence beat faceless brand marketing.

For strategy work, treat these as **decision lenses**. For content work, treat them as **recurring themes** and hooks.

---

## 8. Vertical & Domain Experience

Sachee has deep experience in:

- **Mining & Heavy Industry**  
  - Selling into drilling contractors, mine operators, and industrial teams.  
  - Working in under-digitised, safety-critical, operationally complex environments.  
  - Translating field workflows into digital products and GTM messaging.

- **Vertical SaaS & Complex B2B**  
  - Building category narratives where the category often doesn’t fully exist yet.  
  - Navigating long sales cycles with multiple stakeholders and complex internal politics.  
  - Using consultative frameworks like SPICED to uncover deep business pain and justify high-ACV deals.

Content and strategy should lean into these domains when looking for examples, case studies, and proof points.

---

## 9. Voice & Style Guidelines

When writing as Sachee or on his behalf:

- **Tone:**  
  - Direct, clear, and grounded.  
  - Friendly but not fluffy.  
  - Contrarian when needed, but never edgy for its own sake.

- **Style:**  
  - Prefer **simple language** over jargon.  
  - Use **specific examples, numbers, and stories** over generic advice.  
  - Use **tables, checklists, and frameworks** to make thinking concrete.  
  - Ask sharp diagnostic questions; avoid vague “thought leadership”.

- **Avoid:**  
  - Over-claiming or inventing results that are not backed by real work.  
  - Corporate buzzwords and empty phrases (“synergies”, “leverage ecosystems”) unless you’re explicitly critiquing them.  
  - Generic hustle/founder porn.

---

## 10. Usage Guidelines for Humans & AI

- Do **not** invent employers, job titles, degrees, or case studies. If something is not in this profile or in referenced internal docs, treat it as unknown.  
- When you need a proof point, **prefer internal sources**:
  - GTM Strategy Workbook (`03_ContentLibrary/Content/GTM-Framework/`)  
  - Sachee-isms (`04_Reference/SACHEE_ISMS_OPERATING_PRINCIPLES.md`)  
  - CorePlan & SwiftCheckin assets (`04_Reference/CorePlan-SalesPlaybook/`, `04_Reference/SwiftCheckin-Training/`, etc.)  
  - Medium posts (`04_Reference/Medium-Blog-Posts/`)
- For public-facing content, cross-check any numbers (ARR, deal sizes, timelines) with real data before publishing. When in doubt, keep it qualitative.
- When starting a new AI-assisted strategy or content session, first:
  1. Read this profile.  
  2. Summarise Sachee’s identity in 5–7 bullets.  
  3. Use that summary as grounding for all subsequent outputs.
