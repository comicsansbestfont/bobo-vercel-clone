# Sachee Identity: Story Library

**Purpose:** Reusable story beats that show how Sachee thinks and works in the real world. Use these as source material for talks, articles, LinkedIn posts, and GTM examples.

Each story includes: context, key beats, and internal references. Add new stories as they emerge from client work and campaigns.

## Story 1: From Call Centres to COO – Learning GTM the Hard Way

**Context:** How early career experiences in telco, hospitality, and marketplaces shaped Sachee’s GTM approach long before mining SaaS.

**Core idea:** Before CorePlan, Sachee spent a decade learning sales, operations, and P&L ownership in environments where targets were non-negotiable and every interaction was measurable.

**Key beats:**
- TSA Telco Group: starting in outbound sales and support, progressing to Sales & Retention Manager for Telstra campaigns; learning to sell in tough conditions, coach teams, and design simple dashboards and QA processes.  
- Accor Plus: taking full P&L ownership of an underperforming Perth programme and rebuilding sales strategy, team culture, and performance management to deliver record new sales and renewal rates across APAC.  
- UberEATS Perth: joining the launch team as “first boots on ground” for restaurant partnerships—personally closing and onboarding a large share of initial restaurant accounts and shaping early sales processes and metrics.  
- Sidekicker Perth: leading the WA launch of a dual-sided marketplace, improving worker onboarding and marketplace liquidity while building the local team and GTM from scratch.  
- How this set the stage: by the time he stepped into CorePlan, he had already built and turned around multiple commercial engines, which is why SPICED, presales, and CS at CorePlan were designed as integrated systems rather than isolated functions.

## Story 2: From Drill Rigs to GTM Frameworks (CorePlan Origin)

**Context:** How moving from telco, hospitality, and marketplace launches into mining and heavy industry sharpened Sachee’s GTM philosophy.

**Core idea:** If your product can survive in mining—where downtime is measured in lost ore and rig shutdowns—you learn to build GTM systems that are brutally practical, fast, and obsessed with customer outcomes.

**Key beats:**
- Starting point: Working with drilling contractors and mine operators who don’t care about “AI-powered dashboards”—they care about rigs running and invoices matching meters drilled.  
- Realisation: Traditional SaaS GTM playbooks built for generic software didn’t fit; messaging had to map directly to operational pain (“lost revenue from paper-based plods”, “3-day delays in reconciliation”).  
- Response: Built SPICED-driven discovery, presales (desktop studies), and CS processes tuned for high-stakes, high-friction environments.  
- Outcome: These experiences became the backbone of the **Sachee GTM Strategy Workbook**, which treats GTM as an integrated system across strategy, sales, content, and CS—starting from the field, not the boardroom.

## Story 3: “Speed Is Our Weapon” in Practice

**Context:** How speed, not headcount or budget, becomes the decisive advantage for early-stage SaaS.

**Core idea:** Early-stage founders can’t out-spend incumbents, but they can out-learn and out-ship them. Speed to conversation, speed to insight, and speed to value compound faster than any ad budget.

**Key beats:**
- Examples from CorePlan: moving from multi-week pilots to rapid desktop studies to validate value, dramatically shortening time-to-confidence for prospects.  
- Principle in action: 24-hour response times, same-week demos, and rapid iteration on decks and messaging based on live deals.  
- How this translates to advisory: rejecting over-engineered content funnels in favour of fast, event-anchored sprints (e.g. West Tech Fest “Open Notebook” plan).  
- Takeaway: “Speed is our weapon” is not about rushing; it’s about shortening the feedback loop between customer reality and GTM decisions.

## Story 4: “Save the Cheerleader, Save the World” (Beachhead Strategy)

**Context:** Why tightly focused beachheads beat broad, horizontal plays in vertical SaaS.

**Core idea:** You don’t win by being “for everyone”; you win by going deep on a small segment that cares a lot—and then using that credibility and product depth to unlock the rest of the market.

**Key beats:**
- Mining example: focusing on drilling contractors as the “cheerleader” niche rather than “all of mining”.  
- What made them the cheerleader: acute pain, willingness to move fast, and high visibility across the broader ecosystem.  
- How solving deeply for this segment created leverage: case studies, references, and product depth that translated into credibility with larger operators.  
- Application in SaaS GTM: helping founders pick a Phase 1a/1b beachhead and say “no” to adjacent segments until they have 10–30 wins in the core niche.

## Story 5: From Over-Engineered Funnels to an “Open Notebook” (West Tech Fest)

**Context:** Pivoting from a heavy content strategy to a pragmatic, authority-first sprint anchored on a real event.

**Core idea:** Instead of hiding behind complex funnels and nurture sequences, show up in the ecosystem with an open notebook, ask sharp questions, and create value in public.

**Key beats:**
- Starting point: A comprehensive but over-engineered content strategy (`SACHEE_CONTENT_STRATEGY_DUAL_TRACK_V1.md`) that risked paralysis.  
- Pivot: Use **West Tech Fest** as a forcing function—design a 2-week authority-first GTM sprint centred on research, not overt selling.  
- Execution:  
  - “Open Notebook” positioning: attending WTF to collect field notes on GTM patterns in AU/NZ.  
  - “Positioning One-Liner Sanity Checks” as a low-friction offer for founders.  
  - 4–5 anchor posts + DMs, built around bridge stories (mining → SaaS) and ECP vs ICP.  
- Outcome: A consolidated **West Tech Fest Master Plan** that embodies Sachee’s preference for speed, clarity, and real conversations over complex automation.

## Story 6: “Stupidly Obvious + Highly Detailed” Content

**Context:** Why simple ideas, explained with precision and specificity, outperform vague thought leadership.

**Core idea:** Founders don’t need more clever frameworks—they need the one clear next step, with enough detail to actually do it this week.

**Key beats:**
- Contrast: vague advice (“improve your sales process”) vs concrete guidance (“run SPICED-based discovery calls with these 15 questions”).  
- How this principle shapes the GTM workbook: each section pairs a simple question (e.g. “What problem do we solve?”) with phase-specific tables, diagnostics, and deliverables.  
- Impact on content: posts and guides that include templates, scripts, example questions, and numeric examples rather than generic statements.  
- Takeaway: being “stupidly obvious” earns attention; being “highly detailed” earns trust and action.

## Adding New Stories

When you notice a story coming up repeatedly in:
- Advisory sessions,  
- Sales calls, or  
- Content conversations,

add it here with:
- A clear **title** and **core idea**.  
- 3–5 bullet **key beats**.  
- Pointers to relevant internal files.  

This keeps the story library tight, reusable, and grounded in real work.
