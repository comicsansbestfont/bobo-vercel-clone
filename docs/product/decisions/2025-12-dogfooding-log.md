## Key Questions to Answer

After this week, we should know:
1. Does the current memory system work well enough?
2. Is Loop B (cross-project search) adding value or just latency?

## Quick Reference: Test Queries

Use these to systematically test the system:

**Advisory Briefings:**
- "Brief me on MyTab"
- "What's the status of all my deals?"
- "Which deals have red flags?"
- "Prep me for my call with [name]"

**Memory Retrieval:**
- "What do you know about me?"
- "What are my current priorities?"
- "What methodology do I use for sales?"

**Cross-Project (Loop B):**
- "Have I seen valuation issues like this in other deals?"
- "What patterns do you see across my deals?"

**File Access:**
- "What was my last email to Mikaela?"
- "Show me the Dec 2 meeting notes for MyTab"
- "What research do I have on [company]?"
